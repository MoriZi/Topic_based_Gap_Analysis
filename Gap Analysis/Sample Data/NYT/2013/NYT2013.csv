Cybercrime Network Based in Spain Is Broken Up,"MADRID -- Europol, the European police agency, said Wednesday that it had dismantled one of the most efficient cybercrime organizations to date, led by Russians who had managed to extort millions of euros from online users across more than 30 countries -- mostly European -- by persuading them to pay spurious police fines for abusive use of the Internet. The Russian head of the crime network was arrested in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in December. This month, the Spanish police arrested 10 other people -- six Russians, two Ukrainians and two Georgians -- along the Costa del Sol, a popular vacation destination in southern Spain, where the criminals are believed to have had their main base of operations.  The search continues, however, for other possible cells operated by the criminal network outside of Europe, investigators said. The criminal threat, essentially a form of online extortion called ransomware, relied on malware that authorities believe was developed by the Russian-led gang. It locked a user's computer, and send a message in the form of a fake police warning, demanding 100 euros ($134) to unlock it. ''This is the first major success of its kind against a very new phenomenon that we have only identified in the last two years,'' Rob Wainwright, the director of Europol, said at a news conference at the Interior Ministry in Madrid. ''This is a mass marketing scam to distribute this thousands of times and rely on the fact that even if only 2 percent fall victim to the scam, it is still a very good pickup rate.'' Mr. Wainwright estimated that 3 percent of those victimized had paid the fake fines. Europol did not give an overall estimate of how much money the criminals might have gained, but in Spain alone they are believed to have collected more than 1 million euros ($1.3 million), said Francisco Martínez, Spain's secretary of state for security. Computer security experts in the United States recently estimated that computer criminals make more than $5 million a year on ransomware, though many say that is too conservative. Investigators suggested on Wednesday that the software used by the criminals could also be aimed at online users who were actually likely to have made unlawful use of the Internet, by picking up key words linked to illegal activities like child pornography or illicit file swapping. That would make the threat of a fine for abusive use of the Web more believable for the user. Mr. Wainwright emphasized the complexity of the software, with as many as 48 mutations of the virus detected. ''It used the idiom and logo of each specific police service,'' he said. ''Even Europol and my own name have been used to defraud citizens.'' In most cases of ransomware, victims do not regain access to their computer unless they hire a technician to remove the virus manually. In Spain, after thousands of complaints, the Interior Ministry set up a Web site to help users uninstall the virus. The Web site received about 750,000 visits last year. The Spanish police received 1,200 official complaints about the virus since it was first detected in Spain in May 2011. ''What is clear is that the organization had a very well-structured and complex infrastructure developed from Russia,'' said José Rodríguez, a chief inspector in Spain who handled the investigation. But he said that it also allowed them to ''keep track of victims in Spain, Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere'' from their base in southern Spain. ''These people could have operated from anywhere but somehow found it more convenient to do so from Spain,'' Mr. Rodríguez said. The Spanish police said six of the 10 people arrested this month had already been detained, charged with money laundering, fraud and involvement in a criminal organization. The four others remain under investigation. Europol offered no details on the Russian who was suspected of leading of the gang who was arrested in December. The Spanish police also seized several computers and more than 200 credit cards. They said the suspects also had 26,000 euros ($35,000) in cash, which they were planning to transfer to Russia on the day of their arrest. Europol and other police agencies are still trying to determine just how much money the criminals gained and what it was used for. The gang laundered the money in Spain and elsewhere and sent it to Russia via electronic payments. Europol started its investigation in December 2011 from its operational center in The Hague, after six countries reported more than 20,000 victims of the virus. While the virus generally came with a police warning, the gang is believed to have used different versions to deceive more users, including one fraudulent message that was designed to look as if it had been sent by the Spanish association that defends artists' copyrights.

Spies and Big Business Fight Cyberattacks,"LONDON - Britain's intelligence services, working alongside security experts from private companies, are setting up a secret control center in London to combat what the head of the country's domestic spy agency has described as ""astonishing"" levels of cyberattacks. The existence of the so-called Fusion Cell was due to be confirmed on Wednesday in a statement on the government's strategy to boost information sharing in an expanding cyberwar against online attackers.  'The Fusion Cell' - not a new nightclub in London - a new Cyber defense Intelligence HQ -http://t.co/GuVDUydBWo - Tim Marshall (@Skytwitius)27 Mar 13 A team of security analysts at an undisclosed location will monitor attacks on large screens and provide details in real-time of who is being targeted, according to the BBC. The British initiative, which also includes the creation of a social network-style Web portal to facilitate information exchange, is the latest in a series of international measures to combat what is seen as the growing threat of cyberattacks to both business and government networks.  President Obama last month signed an executive order to increase information sharing about cyberthreats between the government and private companies. ""We have seen a steady ramping up of cybersecurity threats,"" Mr. Obama said in a recent interview. ""Some are state sponsored, some are just sponsored by criminals."" Jonathan Evans, the outgoing head of MI5, Britain's domestic intelligence agency, made a similar point  ahead of last year's London Olympic Games. ""Vulnerabilities in the internet are being exploited aggressively not just by criminals but also by states,"" he said in a rare interview. ""The extent of what is going on is astonishing."" The victims are said to include big companies. The BBC said one major London listed company had lost the equivalent of $1.2 billion as a result of a cyberattack from a hostile state. Some 160 companies - from the financial, defense, energy, telecommunications and pharmaceutical sector - have signed up to a pilot program for the British government's information sharing initiative since it was launched last year. The European Union, meanwhile, is studying proposals for greater information sharing among the 27-member alliance following a series of high-profile cyberattacks directed at eBay, PayPal and Diginotar, a Dutch Internet certificate company. Despite increased international attention to a growing cyberwar, some skeptics believe the threat is being hyped by governments and by companies involved in an increasingly lucrative and pervasive security industry.  ""Anything that uses 'cyber' in its title is a con and should be laughed out of the room,"" according to Glynn Moody, blogging at ComputerWorld UK this week. ""Yes, attacks take place, but the fact that they take place across the Internet is no different from those using any other technology,"" wrote Mr. Moody, an ""open source"" expert. ""Trying to claim that the 'cyberthreat' is somehow qualitatively different is merely a demonstration of the abiding ignorance and fear that afflicts our rulers when it comes to the digital realm."" In the United States and elsewhere, plans to combat the threat have raised privacy concerns and accusations that governments are overreacting. ""A reminder is in order,"" Thomas Rid wrote at Foreign Policy this month. ""The world has yet to witness a single casualty, let alone fatality, as a result of a computer attack."" Mr. Rid, a London University war studies expert, said private computer security companies were keen to pocket government money earmarked for cybersecurity. ""And hype is the means to that end."" The cybertrend has already been spotted by investors. The U.S.-based Investment U Web site said this week it had spotted ""a great investment opportunity"" back in 2011. ""Fast forward to the present,"" Investment U's Jason Jenkins wrote. ""Cyber stocks are finally starting to move. And the cybercrime issue has exploded - not just in terms of domestic fraud, but it has now been elevated to national security problem No. 1."" The potential opportunities were spotted by the British government as it prepared to announce its new Fusion Cell. ""Businesses that take cybersecurity seriously can gain commercial advantages from doing so,"" James Brokenshire, the British minister for security, said earlier this month, adding, ""The U.K. can export expertise through the growth of a vibrant U.K. security industry.""  "
Legislation Seeks to Bar N.S.A. Tactic In Encryption,"After disclosures about the National Security Agency's stealth campaign to counter Internet privacy protections, a congressman has proposed legislation that would prohibit the agency from installing ''back doors'' into encryption, the electronic scrambling that protects e-mail, online transactions and other communications. Representative Rush D. Holt, a New Jersey Democrat who is also a physicist, said Friday that he believed the N.S.A. was overreaching and could hurt American interests, including the reputations of American companies whose products the agency may have altered or influenced. ''We pay them to spy,'' Mr. Holt said. ''But if in the process they degrade the security of the encryption we all use, it's a net national disservice.'' Mr. Holt, whose Surveillance State Repeal Act would eliminate much of the escalation in the government's spying powers undertaken after the 2001 terrorist attacks, was responding to news reports about N.S.A. documents showing that the agency has spent billions of dollars over the last decade in an effort to defeat or bypass encryption. The reports, by The New York Times, ProPublica and The Guardian, were posted online on Thursday.  The agency has encouraged or coerced companies to install back doors in encryption software and hardware, worked to weaken international standards for encryption and employed custom-built supercomputers to break codes or find mathematical vulnerabilities to exploit, according to the documents, disclosed by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor. The documents show that N.S.A. cryptographers have made major progress in breaking the encryption in common use for everyday transactions on the Web, like Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, as well as the virtual private networks, or VPNs, that many businesses use for confidential communications among employees. Intelligence officials say that many of their most important targets, including terrorist groups, use the same Webmail and other Internet services that many Americans use, so it is crucial to be able to penetrate the encryption that protects them. In an intense competition with other sophisticated cyberespionage services, including those of China and Russia, the N.S.A. cannot rule large parts of the Internet off limits, the officials argue. A statement from the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., criticized the reports, saying that it was ''not news'' that the N.S.A. works to break encryption, and that the articles would damage American intelligence collection. The reports, the statement said, ''reveal specific and classified details about how we conduct this critical intelligence activity.'' ''Anything that yesterday's disclosures add to the ongoing public debate,'' it continued, ''is outweighed by the road map they give to our adversaries about the specific techniques we are using to try to intercept their communications in our attempts to keep America and our allies safe and to provide our leaders with the information they need to make difficult and critical national security decisions.'' But if intelligence officials felt a sense of betrayal by the disclosures, Internet security experts felt a similar letdown -- at the N.S.A. actions. ''There's widespread disappointment,'' said Dan Kaminsky, a prominent security researcher. ''This has been the stuff of wild-eyed accusations for years. A lot of people are heartbroken to find out it's not just wild-eyed accusations.'' Sascha Meinrath, the director of the Open Technology Institute, a research group in Washington, said the reports were ''a startling indication that the U.S. has been a remarkably irresponsible steward of the Internet,'' which he said the N.S.A. was trying to turn into ''a massive platform for detailed, intrusive and unrestrained surveillance.'' Companies like Google and Facebook have been moving to new systems that, in principle, would make government eavesdropping more difficult. Google is in the process of encrypting all data that travels via fiber-optic lines between its data centers. The company speeded up the process in June after the initial N.S.A. disclosures, according to two people who were briefed on Google's plans but were not authorized to speak publicly about them. The acceleration of the process was first reported Friday by The Washington Post. For services like Gmail, once data reaches a user's computer it has been encrypted. But as messages and other data like search queries travel internally among Google's data centers they are not encrypted, largely because it is technically complicated and expensive to do. Facebook announced last month that it would also transition to a novel encryption method, called perfect forward secrecy, that makes eavesdropping far more difficult. Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil liberties group in Washington, said the quandary posed by the N.S.A.'s efforts against encryption began with its dual role: eavesdropping on foreign communications while protecting American communications. ''Invariably the two missions collide,'' he said. ''We don't dispute that their ability to capture foreign intelligence is quite important. The question is whether their pursuit of that mission threatens to undermine the security and privacy of Internet communications.'' Mr. Rotenberg is a veteran of what were known as the ''crypto wars'' of the 1990s, when the N.S.A. proposed the Clipper Chip, a government back door that would be built into every encryption program. That proposal was defeated by a diverse coalition of technology businesses and privacy advocates, including Mr. Rotenberg's organization. But the documents make clear that the N.S.A. never gave up on the goal of being able to read everything and has made what memos call ''breakthroughs'' in recent years in its efforts. A complicating factor is the role of the major American Internet companies, which have been the target of counterencryption efforts by both the N.S.A. and its closely allied British counterpart, GCHQ. One document describes ''new access opportunities'' in Google systems; the company said on Thursday that it had not given the agencies access and was aware of no breach of its security. But the perception of an N.S.A. intrusion into the networks of major Internet companies, whether surreptitious or with the companies' cooperation, could hurt business, especially in international markets. ''What buyer is going to purchase a product that has been deliberately made less secure?'' asked Mr. Holt, the congressman. ''Even if N.S.A. does it with the purest motive, it can ruin the reputations of billion-dollar companies.'' In addition, news that the N.S.A. is inserting vulnerabilities into widely used technologies could put American lawmakers and technology companies in a bind with regard to China. Over the last two years, American lawmakers have accused two of China's largest telecommunications companies, Huawei Technologies and ZTE, of doing something parallel to what the N.S.A. has done: planting back doors into their equipment to allow for eavesdropping by the Chinese government and military. Both companies have denied collaborating with the Chinese government, but the allegations have eliminated the companies' hopes for significant business growth in the United States. After an investigation last year, the House Intelligence Committee concluded that government agencies should be barred from doing business with Huawei and ZTE, and that American companies should avoid buying their equipment. Some foreign governments and companies have also said that they would not rely on the Chinese companies' equipment out of security concerns. Last year, Australia barred Huawei from bidding on contracts in Australia's $38 billion national broadband network. And this year, as part of its effort to acquire Sprint Nextel, SoftBank of Japan pledged that it would not use Huawei equipment in Sprint's cellphone network. "
Daily Report: Europe Weighs Regulations for Cloud Computing,"The digital privacy regulation introduced in Europe last year, which did not initially address cloud computing, is expanding to cover this ascendant method of handling data, Danny Hakim reports.  Even before revelations this summer by Edward J. Snowden on the extent of spying by the National Security Agency on electronic communications, the European Parliament busied itself attaching amendments to its data privacy regulation. Several would change the rules of cloud computing, the technology that enables the sharing of software and files among computers on the Internet. And since the news broke of widespread monitoring by the United States spy agency, cloud computing has become one of the regulatory flash points in Brussels as a debate has ensued over how to protect data from snooping American eyes. Cloud technology has become a routine part of digital life, whether it is used for Web-based services to send e-mail or to warehouse troves of business or government records. It has enabled the convenient sharing of data among mobile devices and enhanced the ability of people to collaborate and share documents. It has also cut the cost of doing business. But transmitting data among mobile phones, tablet computers and clouds, even while encrypted, makes it more accessible to snooping. The European Union wants to regulate the cloud, even if that makes its use more complicated.  "
A Way to Make Phone Records Not So Easy to Track,"The ease with which the Obama administration was able to secure the Associated Press' phone records may have demonstrated once and for all that privacy is dead. Be you a journalist, whistle-blower, adulterer, advocate, overseas soldier, or perhaps a patient trying to keep your terminal illness a secret, your online and mobile communications are no longer private. Period. That said, had Associated Press reporters and editors used Silent Circle for their communications, law enforcement may have had far less with which to work.  Silent Circle, an encryption service for iPhone and Android-powered smartphones, gives users a private, 10-digit telephone number that can be used to make encrypted phone calls, send text messages and do videoconferencing. Silent Circle's founders introduced Silent Mail, a separate e-mail encryption offering last month. Silent Circle phone calls would not show up in phone records and any effort by law enforcement to eavesdrop would sound like gibberish. Text messages are scrubbed completely from the phone after a predetermined amount of time and the communications are secured with peer-reviewed open-source encryption technology developed by Phil Zimmermann, a pioneer of encryption software. Mr. Zimmermann was himself the subject of a criminal investigation after introducing Pretty Good Privacy encryption software in the 1990s - his charges were officially dropped in 1996. Today, his P.G.P. software is the most widely used e-mail encryption software in the world. He is the co-founder of Silent Circle. Individuals pay $20 a month to communicate with other Silent Circle users, while businesses are charged per employee. It's pricier than Skype but cheaper than fighting a Justice Department investigation. For an additional $29 a month, users can dial outside Silent Circle, in which case the service encrypts any communications between users and its servers in Canada. The choice of Canada is hardly random. Canada has much stricter privacy laws than the United States or even the European Union. By placing its servers in Canada, Silent Circle communications are outside the reach of U.S. law enforcement. Maybe.  "
Daily Report: Google Concedes That Drive-by Prying Violated Privacy,"Google acknowledged on Tuesday that it had violated people's privacy during its Street View mapping project when it casually scooped up passwords, e-mails and other personal information from unsuspecting computer users, David Streitfeld reports in The New York Times.  In agreeing to settle a case brought by 38 states involving the project, the search company for the first time is required to aggressively police its own employees on privacy issues and to explicitly instruct the public about how to fend off privacy violations like this one. While the settlement also included a tiny - for Google - fine of $7 million, privacy advocates and Google critics characterized the overall agreement as a breakthrough for a company they say has become a serial violator of privacy, with multiple enforcement actions in recent years and a slew of worldwide investigations into the way the mapping project also collected the personal data of private computer users. ""Google puts innovation ahead of everything and resists asking permission,"" said Scott Cleland, a consultant and consumer watchdog whose blog maintains a close watch on privacy issues involving Google. ""But the states are throwing down a marker that they are watching and there is a line the company shouldn't cross."" The agreement paves the way for a major privacy battle over Google Glass, the much-hyped wearable computer in the form of glasses, Mr. Cleland said. ""If you use Google Glass to record a couple whispering to each other in Starbucks, have you violated their privacy?"" he asked. ""Well, 38 states just said they have a problem with the unauthorized collection of people's data."" George Jepsen, the Connecticut attorney general who led the states' investigation, said he was hopeful the settlement would produce a new Google. ""This is the industry giant,"" he said. ""It is committing to change its corporate culture to encourage sensitivity to issues of personal data privacy.""  "
Google Says Electronic Snooping by Governments Should Be More Difficult,"If a government wants to peek into your Web-based e-mail account, it is surprisingly easy, most of the time not even requiring a judge's approval.  That is a problem, according to Google, which said it had received 21,389 requests for information about 33,634 of its users in the second half of last year,an increase of 70 percentin three years. Google handed over some personal data in two-thirds of those cases.  The vast majority of the requests came from the United States government. In the last six months, United States officials made 8,438 requests for data, and Google complied with at least part of the request 88 percent of the time. (One of those, most likely, was for access to the Gmail account of Paula Broadwell, which ultimately revealed her affair with David H. Petraeus, formerly C.I.A. director.)   To mark Data Privacy Day on Monday (a holiday that, no doubt, you have highlighted on your calendar in eager anticipation), Google is trying to rally support against broad government access to personal online data.  ""We want to be sure we're taking our responsibilities really seriously, protecting our users' information and being transparent about it,"" David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, said in a rare interview.  ""We want people to know that we are not going to just roll over but we are going to make sure that governments around the world follow standards and do this in a reasonable way that strikes the balance,"" he added.  The heart of the issue is that thelaw grants more protection  to a piece of paper on your desk than it does to an e-mail stored online. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was enacted in 1986, years before widespread use of e-mail or cloud storage, or the invention of social networking.  ""People probably assume that all their communications, whether it's physical letters or phone calls or e-mails, are protected by the Fourth Amendment and the police have to go to a judge to get a warrant,"" said Trevor Timm, a privacy advocate studying surveillance at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""In fact, that's not the case.""  For instance, the law says the police do not need a search warrant, which requires a judge to agree there is probable cause, to read e-mail messages that are more than 180 days old.  Congress is expected to consider amendments to the 1986 law this year. Meanwhile, the Obama administration has been pushing for Web companies to allow easier electronic wiretapping.  In the United States, 68 percent of requests for Google users' information come in the form of subpoenas, which do not require a judge's approval. The rest are search warrants or other types of court orders.   Google said it had been fighting the broad use of subpoenas by requiring search warrants for detailed personal data -- beyond things like a user's name, location, phone number and time that an e-mail was sent -- even if the law seems to say a subpoena is enough.  In a primer published on Monday, Google says it requires a search warrant to share Gmail messages, private YouTube videos, stored voicemails or text messages on Google Voice and private blog posts on Blogger.  Though Google has sometimes struggled over the years  to earn users' trust inhow it handles personal data, the company stands out in its efforts to protect users against government requests for data.  ""Google's been kind of a pioneer,"" Mr. Timm said.  Since 2010, it has published its transparency report, outlining the number of government requests it receives for users' data or to remove content from the Web. Companies including Twitter, which employs several former Google lawyers, have followed suit. Mr. Drummond says he wants other Web companies to do so, too.  Google says it scrutinizes each government request, narrows the scope if possible, and notifies users of the request if it is not prohibited by law.   "
Can't Hide in the Cloud,"Most Internet users were disabused of the notion that their online activities could be kept entirely secret long before the recent revelations that the National Security Agency has been tracking the phone calls and online communications of millions of people. And to a great degree, consumers have traded privacy for convenience -- like having Web retailers store your credit card number to save you some typing on your next order. Still, the scope of the government's surveillance programs left some users and businesses wondering what, if anything, can be done to claw back more control over private information. The answer is complicated: most users could do more to safeguard themselves, but no software or service can protect them fully from determined government agencies, criminals or hackers.  The problem is that we have collectively ceded our privacy bit by bit as we have moved more social and business interactions from the physical realm to the so-called cloud, powered by tens of thousands of computers at server farms owned and managed by companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook. And it might be incredibly hard, if not impossible, to regain what we have given up. While moving house recently, I came across a box of letters I had received in high school and college, some more than 20 years old. Other people cannot see those letters unless I let them, a court orders that I divulge their contents or they are physically stolen. But I can't say the same about the nine-year-old messages in my Gmail account. I might think those messages are confidential just as I might hope that my private Facebook posts are, well, private. But in reality they aren't and never were. This is not a nostalgic lament. The Internet has no doubt made life more convenient. I can share photos with dozens of friends in minutes on Flickr, something that would have taken me days to do if I were having them printed and mailed. And it's much easier for, say, accountants or bankers to do their jobs now that they can have a video chat with a co-worker on the other side of the planet. Some people control the amount of information they put online; some have deactivated their Facebook accounts because of privacy concerns. But privacy settings don't shield you from government intrusion or hacking. Even without posting personal data online, most of us leave trackable traces of ourselves online every day. Your high school, university or employer might be knowingly or unwittingly putting information about you online. Just as it would be extremely hard to survive off the electrical grid, it's become nearly impossible to live and work without e-mail or cellphones. The supervigilant are starting to use software to encrypt their e-mail and Internet chats. Many, if not most, businesses already use virtual private networks to allow employees to connect to their computers while shutting out outsiders. Activists and dissidents in foreign countries have been using Tor, which attempts to obscure users' digital trails by breaking up and sending their Internet traffic on multiple paths. But such technologies all have limitations, and users have to be technically adept and diligent to gain any benefit. The fact is, the privacy war is asymmetric. Governments have spent billions to develop tools to conduct surveillance and hack into computer systems. Far fewer resources have been devoted to protecting users from such intrusions, said Seth Schoen, the senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy and research organization. New technical tools might put up a privacy screen for a while, but over time intruders will come up with new ways to get around them, too. There may be no stopping that cat-and-mouse game, but at the very least we can demand that lawmakers protect us from abusive and unwarranted surveillance by the government. "
Close the N.S.A.'s Back Doors,"In 2006, a federal agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, helped build an international encryption system to help countries and industries fend off computer hacking and theft. Unbeknown to the many users of the system, a different government arm, the National Security Agency, secretly inserted a ''back door'' into the system that allowed federal spies to crack open any data that was encoded using its technology.  Documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, make clear that the agency has never met an encryption system that it has not tried to penetrate. And it frequently tries to take the easy way out. Because modern cryptography can be so hard to break, even using the brute force of the agency's powerful supercomputers, the agency prefers to collaborate with big software companies and cipher authors, getting hidden access built right into their systems. The New York Times, The Guardian and ProPublica recently reported that the agency now has access to the codes that protect commerce and banking systems, trade secrets and medical records, and everyone's e-mail and Internet chat messages, including virtual private networks. In some cases, the agency pressured companies to give it access; as The Guardian reported earlier this year, Microsoft provided access to Hotmail, Outlook.com, SkyDrive and Skype. According to some of the Snowden documents given to Der Spiegel, the N.S.A. also has access to the encryption protecting data on iPhones, Android and BlackBerry phones. These back doors and special access routes are a terrible idea, another example of the intelligence community's overreach. Companies and individuals are increasingly putting their most confidential data on cloud storage services, and need to rely on assurances their data will be secure. Knowing that encryption has been deliberately weakened will undermine confidence in these systems and interfere with commerce. The back doors also strip away the expectations of privacy that individuals, businesses and governments have in ordinary communications. If back doors are built into systems by the N.S.A., who is to say that other countries' spy agencies -- or hackers, pirates and terrorists -- won't discover and exploit them? The government can get a warrant and break into the communications or data of any individual or company suspected of breaking the law. But crippling everyone's ability to use encryption is going too far, just as the N.S.A. has exceeded its boundaries in collecting everyone's phone records rather than limiting its focus to actual suspects. Representative Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, has introduced a bill that would, among other provisions, bar the government from requiring software makers to insert built-in ways to bypass encryption. It deserves full Congressional support. In the meantime, several Internet companies, including Google and Facebook, are building encryption systems that will be much more difficult for the N.S.A. to penetrate, forced to assure their customers that they are not a secret partner with the dark side of their own government. "
Thieves Break Into a Personal 'Data Vault' Company,"A company that describes itself as a vault for personal data has suffered an embarrassing heist: intruders penetrated its computer system and looted its customers' names, addresses and in some cases, dates of birth and login passwords.  The company, Reputation.com, based in Redwood City, Calif., told customers in an e-mail sent around 5 p.m. Pacific time Tuesday that it had detected a breach into its system and immediately reset customer passwords. It does not believe credit card information was taken. Passwords are especially coveted items because many people reuse them across multiple Web sites, and cyberthieves have in turn developed new automated ways to try and reuse them to ferret out more valuable data from different Web sites.  LivingSocial and Evernote experienced similar breaches in recent months.  In its e-mail to users, Reputation said it had ""identified, interrupted and swiftly shut down an external attack on our secure network."" The company said it had encrypted user passwords, which could theoretically still protect them, but has not yet said what algorithm it used to protect customer data. Reputation has not yet responded to a request for comment, except to point to the e-mail it sent to customers. Reputation's co-founder, Michael Fertik, has described the company as a ""data vault,"" or ""a bank for other people's data."" Its services include identifying Web sites that sell personal data, removing personal data from some sites and blocking online tracking.  "
Europe Moves Ahead on Privacy,"The European Union is considering far-reaching privacy regulations that would give the citizens of its member countries significant control over how Web sites and marketing companies collect and use data about them. Years in the making, the effort stands in stark contrast to the much slower pace of discussions about online privacy laws in Washington. Reports in The Times and elsewhere have documented the dubious but legal ways in which companies, including many that most people do not even know exist, build profiles of people's behaviors, browsing histories and shopping habits by tracking them online and off, through data from retailers, for instance. Those profiles are then sold to marketers and others without the knowledge of the person whose information is being traded.  Europe has historically been more protective of personal information than the United States, which still has no general law to protect people's privacy online while most E.U. nations do. The privacy policies of American companies are voluntary, with the exception of protection under federal laws for certain kinds of sensitive information like health records and data about children younger than 13. Now, European policy makers are proposing to harmonize new, tougher rules across the 27-member union. Several proposals would go well beyond the voluntary policies of companies like Google. They would require companies to obtain permission before collecting personal data and specify exactly what information will be collected and how it will be used. If asked, companies would have to provide users with data that has been collected about them and allow them to fix mistakes. One proposal would include a so-called ''right to be forgotten'' that would make it mandatory for companies like Facebook to delete all information about users who want to wipe the slate clean. Internet companies and the Obama administration are lobbying against some of the measures, which they argue would place onerous restrictions on services that people want to use and impede the sharing of information between Europe and the United States, particularly between law enforcement agencies. But privacy advocates say that those concerns are overblown and that most Internet companies and news sites would easily get the consent of users who already willingly hand them personal information. Senior European leaders like Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission, have promised that the final policy will protect consumers in ways that will not stifle new ideas and data sharing. The E.U. could approve a new privacy policy later this year. Efforts to improve protections do not appear to be advancing in Washington. American policy makers have made little progress on a sensible proposal made by the Federal Trade Commission in 2010 known as ''do not track.'' Carried out properly, the measure would give users an easy way to prevent companies from surreptitiously amassing information about them to pitch them ads. Ideally, Web browsers would have a default setting that barred tracking but allow consumers to opt for tracking, which many might do because they want to receive special offers. (The New York Times tracks users on its Web site but does not monitor their activities on other sites or sell their personal data to third parties.) The Obama administration has talked with technology and marketing companies about creating voluntary industry standards. But the best way to ensure that Americans can keep their personal information private is through federal legislation backed by regulatory enforcement. Europe is setting an example of how that might be accomplished. While the United States is unlikely to go as far as the E.U., it needs to do a lot more. "
"An American Quilt of Privacy Laws, Incomplete","WE don't need a new platform. We just need to rebrand. That was the message of a report from the Republican Party a few weeks ago on how to win future presidential elections. It's also the strategy that Peter Fleischer, the global privacy counsel at Google, recently proposed for the United States to win converts abroad to its legal model of data privacy protection. In a post on his personal blog, titled ''We Need a Better, Simpler Narrative of U.S. Privacy Laws,'' he describes the divergent legal frameworks in the United States and Europe. The American system involves a patchwork of federal and state privacy laws that separately govern the use of personal details in spheres like patient billing, motor vehicle records, education and video rental records. The European Union, on the other hand, has one blanket data protection directive that lays out principles for how information about its citizens may be collected and used, no matter the industry. Mr. Fleischer -- whose blog notes that it reflects his personal views, not his employer's -- is a proponent of the patchwork system because, he writes, it offers multilayered protection for Americans. The problem with it, he argues, is that it doesn't lend itself to simple storytelling.  ''Europe's privacy narrative is simple and appealing,'' Mr. Fleischer wrote in mid-March. If the United States wants to foster trust in American companies operating abroad, he added, it ''has to figure out how to explain its privacy laws on a global stage."" Other technology experts, however, view the patchwork quilt of American privacy laws as more of a macramé arrangement -- with serious gaps in consumer protection, particularly when it comes to data collection online. Congress should enact a baseline consumer privacy law, says Leslie Harris, the president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a public policy group that promotes Internet freedom. ""I don't think this fight is about branding,"" Ms. Harris says. ''We've been trying to get a comprehensive privacy law for over a decade, a law that would work for today and for technologies that we have not yet envisioned."" Many Americans are aware that stores, Web sites, apps, ad networks, loyalty card programs and so on collect and analyze details about their purchases, activities and interests -- online and off. Last year, both the United States and the European Union proposed to give their citizens greater control over such commercial data-mining. If the American side now appears to be losing the public relations battle, as Mr. Fleischer suggested, it may be because Europe has forged ahead with its project to modernize data protection. When officials of the United States and the European Union start work on a free trade agreement in the coming months, the trans-Atlantic privacy regulation divide is likely to be one of the sticking points, analysts say. ''We really are an outlier,'' says Christopher Calabrese, legislative counsel for privacy-related issues at the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington. For the moment, officials on either side of the Atlantic seem to be operating at different speeds. In January 2012, the European Commission proposed a new regulation that could give citizens in the E.U.'s 27 member states some legal powers that Americans now lack. These include the right to transfer text, photo and video files in usable formats from one online service provider to another. American consumers do not have such a national right to data portability, and have to depend on the largesse of companies like Google, which permits them to download their own YouTube videos or Picasa photo albums. A month after Europe proposed to update its data protections, the Obama administration called on Congress to enact a ''consumer privacy bill of rights'' that would apply to industries not already covered by sectoral privacy laws. These could include data brokers, companies that collect details on an individual's likes, leisure pursuits, shopping habits, financial status, health interests and more. The White House's blueprint for legislation, for example, would give Americans the right to some control over how their personal data is used, as well as the right to see and correct records that companies hold about them. The White House initiative broadened the historical American view of privacy as ''the right to be let alone'' -- a definition put forward by Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren in 1890 -- to a more modern concept of privacy as the right to commercial data control. ""We can't wait,"" a post on the White House blog effused at the time. A year later, the data protection regulation proposed by the European Commission has been vetted by a number of regulators and committees of the European Parliament. The document now has several thousand amendments, some developed in response to American trade groups that had complained that certain provisions could hinder innovation and impede digital free trade. Peter Hustinx, the European data protection supervisor, said last Wednesday that European officials hoped to enact the law by next spring. In the United States, by contrast, a year after the Obama administration introduced the notion of a consumer privacy bill of rights, a draft has yet to be completed, let alone made public. Cameron F. Kerry, the general counsel of the Commerce Department and the official overseeing the privacy effort, was not available to comment last week. In a phone interview in January, however, Mr. Kerry said that the agency was working on legislative language to carry out the White House's plan. ''The idea is to have baseline privacy protections for those areas not covered today by sectoral regimes,'' Mr. Kerry said. He added: ''We think it is important to do it in a way that allows for flexibility, that allows for innovation, and is not overly prescriptive.'' Chris Gaither, a Google spokesman, said his company was ''engaging on important issues'' like security breach notification and declined to comment on consumer privacy legislation. But at least some American technology companies suggest that a baseline privacy law could benefit both consumers and companies. In a statement last year, Microsoft said national privacy legislation could help ensure ''that all businesses are using, storing and sharing data in responsible ways.'' With stronger European data rights and trade negotiations pending, Ms. Harris, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, says Congress may feel pressure to pass privacy legislation. That would represent a big change for American consumers as well as a better privacy sound bite abroad. ''We either have to enact our own law or we are going to have to comply with other countries' laws,'' Ms. Harris says. ''But doing nothing may no longer be the answer.''

F.T.C. Member Starts 'Reclaim Your Name' Campaign for Personal Data,"The revelations this month about government surveillance programs that collect the phone logs of people in the United States and can monitor e-mail traffic abroad are provoking a larger debate on the rights of consumers to control the collection and sharing of data about them.  One industry under the microscope is data brokerages. These are business-to-business companies that collect thousands of details - like the shopping habits, vacation preferences, estimated income, ethnicity, hobbies, predilections for gambling or smoking and health concerns - about millions of consumers, the better to help marketers identify potential new customers as well as maintain their already loyal clients. Although some of these companies do permit people to opt out of their marketing databases, most do not have systems to allow consumers to see records held about them and correct possible errors. Because of this lack of transparency, federal regulators and privacy advocates have long warned about the potential for such data-mining to discriminate against consumers based on sensitive details like financial or health information. Now Julie Brill, a member of the Federal Trade Commission, has proposed an industrywide initiative to give consumers access to their own records held by data brokers. She envisions an online portal where data brokers would describe their data collection practices and their consumer access policies. Ms. Brill has come up with a handy nickname for her proposed effort: ""Reclaim Your Name."" ""Reclaim Your Name would empower the consumer to find out how brokers are collecting and using data; give her access to information that data brokers have amassed about her; allow her to opt-out if she learns a data broker is selling her information for marketing purposes and provide her the opportunity to correct errors in information used for substantive decisions - like credit, insurance, employment, and other benefits,"" Ms. Brill said in a speech on Wednesday morning at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference in Washington. Here's a link to the full text of Ms. Brill's speech. Over the last year, legislators in the House and Senate have separately opened investigations into the practices of some leading data brokers with the goal of increasing oversight of the industry. Participation in a voluntary ""Reclaim Your Name"" program of the kind Ms. Brill proposed might help the industry mitigate government efforts toward greater regulation.  "
Q&A: Protecting a PC From Spam and Spoofs," Q.  I keep getting e-mail from someone I know, but the messages do not seem to be from him - they are all junk advertisements. Does my friend have a computer virus, and can I catch it on my PC by opening these messages?   A.  Your friend's computer may be infected with malicious software that is using his address book to spread itself. It is also possible that someone else has gained control of your friend's account, or that the real sender is forging (spoofing) his address in hopes that the message will get by spam filters. You can keep your computer safer by not clicking on any included Web links or opening any file attachments that may be included in the messages. An up-to-date security program - one that includes antivirus, anti-spyware and firewall protections - can catch many forms of malware.  If you do not have a commercial security suite, About.com has a list of free basic antivirus programs.  Free versions of anti-spyware programs like Malwarebytes and Spybot Search & Destroy are also available. You should contact your friend with the suspect e-mail account and let him know about the situation. He should also check his machine with anti-malware software for viruses and things like Trojan horse programs. (Trojan horse malware can do things like record password keystrokes or even turn the computer into a remote-control machine for someone else.) After scanning the computer, he should also change his passwords for e-mail and other services, especially if malware or unfamiliar messages in the e-mail account's out-box were discovered. It can be harder to deal with messages that are merely forging your friend's return address in the sender field. (Looking at the full message header to see the originating e-mail address can reveal a spoof; the steps for displaying headers in several mail programs  are here). If spoofing is the cause, there is not much you can do, but the PC World site has an article on minimizing exposure to e-mail spoofing.  "
Europe Considers a Requirement to Report Data Breaches,"BERLIN -- To combat a rise in cybercrime, the European Commission is considering a plan to require companies that store data on the Internet -- like Microsoft, Apple, Google and I.B.M. -- to report the loss or theft of personal information in the 27-nation bloc or risk sanctions and fines. The proposal, which is being drafted by Neelie Kroes, the European Union's commissioner for the digital agenda, aims to impose, for the first time, E.U.-wide reporting requirements on companies that run large databases, those used for Internet searches, social networks, e-commerce or cloud services. The proposed directive would supplant a patchwork of national laws in Europe that have made reporting mandatory in Germany and Spain, but voluntary in Britain and Italy. While European lawmakers are trying to limit cybercrime, the plan by Mrs. Kroes has generated controversy because it would extend the obligation to report data breaches beyond traditional compilers of customer databases -- telephone, transport and utility companies.  The technology industry supports the idea of a more systematic approach to the flagging of security breaches, but says the proposal needs more specific guidelines to ensure that notifications are required only when necessary and useful to consumers. ''Harmonization of the notification requirements for security breaches is important and should be addressed,'' said Thomas Boué, the government affairs director in Brussels for the Business Software Alliance, whose members include Microsoft, I.B.M., Apple, Oracle and Intel. ''More precise guidelines in the directive on the trigger and threshold procedures would make the system more workable.'' Cybercrime has risen sharply in Europe. A series of high-profile hacking attacks on governments and businesses has galvanized European lawmakers to focus on the need to strengthen and harmonize existing laws, which vary widely across the Union and differ on the levels of disclosure required. In Britain alone, businesses and governments reported 821 cyberattacks in 2011, 15 percent of which resulted in the theft of data on individuals, according to the country's Information Commissioner's Office. The attacks represented a more than tenfold increase over the 79 incidents reported in 2007. In one of the breaches, health officials in Scotland reported, the medical records of 104 children had been compromised. Big companies in Britain are attacked about once a week on average by cybercriminals seeking data, and small businesses are targeted once a month, according to a survey last year of 400 businesses by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. The cost to the biggest companies of taking the steps necessary to repel an attack and deal with the damage caused by one can reach about £250,000, or $400,000. Karin Retzer, a lawyer in Brussels who advises businesses on compliance with European data protection laws, said it was hard to say whether European lawmakers would ultimately adopt the rules, the first effort of the kind worldwide. ''We are in a fairly early stage,'' said Ms. Retzer, of the firm Morrison & Foerster. ''There is a lot of opposition.'' Under E.U. law adopted in 2009, the operators of critical ''communications infrastructure'' are supposed to follow guidelines on reporting data breaches, but Ms. Retzer said enforcement was spotty at best. Many E.U. countries have applied the mandate only to phone companies, while others have rules on paper for Web businesses but have never enforced them. Mrs. Kroes, a Dutch economist, made data security a priority when she took over the position of digital agenda commissioner in 2010. Early last year, she drafted the outlines of an E.U.-wide strategy for cybersecurity with Cecilia Malmstrom, the home affairs commissioner, and Catherine Ashton, the E.U.'s representative for foreign policy The proposal was supposed to be released last September, but now is expected to be reviewed by the European Commission on Jan. 30. According to a copy of the plan seen by the International Herald Tribune, the new reporting requirements would be applied to, among others, the ''enablers of Internet services, e-commerce platforms, Internet payment gateways, social networks, search engines, cloud computing services, application stores.'' The proposal directs E.U. countries to impose penalties on organizations that do not heed the notification rules, and requires them to craft national disclosure laws that are ''appropriate, effective, proportionate and dissuasive.'' Liam Benham, a vice president in charge of governmental programs at I.B.M. Europe, whose cloud-based computing services could be affected by any new reporting mandates, said the reporting requirements should be limited to the operators of critical infrastructure, like power grids, financial networks and transport systems. ''It could subject a wide array of industries to sweeping new regulation, and appears to mandate technology standards largely written by government, not industry,'' Mr. Benham said. To become law, the proposal must be adopted by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers. Mrs. Kroes, through a spokesman, said she aimed to improve the security of European data networks, not necessarily set new data protection standards. It would be negligent, she said, to exclude the technology and Web companies from the reporting requirements, given the rapid shift of many computing resources to remote ''cloud'' centers. ''Cybersecurity is too important to leave to chance, to the good will of individual companies,'' Mrs. Kroes said in a statement. She plans to publicly present details of the plan on Friday. ''Network security problems that can affect everyone have a clear public interest dimension,'' she said. Support for a uniform European approach to cybersecurity could be significant, as long as a balance is struck between consumer and business interests. Four in 10 consumers in the Union avoid making online purchases because of concern about the security of their personal data, according to the commission. In public comments on the proposal, collected from July 23 to Oct. 15, two-thirds of the 160 groups, individuals and organizations that responded said they would favor E.U. rules to regulate the notification of data breaches. Nearly 9 in 10 respondents said the requirement should include Internet services. The piecemeal system of national oversight in Europe has been criticized by the European Network and Information Security Agency as inadequate. But the agency, which advises the commission and is supposed to ensure the security of the bloc's critical infrastructure, warned in 2011 that short-staffed national regulators might be overwhelmed by broad new E.U. requirements that could generate thousands of notifications. In the United States, Web businesses are not required to give notification of data breaches, and rules are enforced by state, not national, governments. Most of the state laws are modeled on a 2003 California law, the country's first. As in Europe, attempts to create a national U.S. reporting mandate have foundered in the face of industry opposition. In November, the U.S. Senate defeated a cybersecurity bill sponsored by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, and Senator Susan M. Collins, a Republican from Maine, that would have encouraged water and electric utilities and transport network operators to improve the security of their computer systems. The bill, supported by the administration of President Barack Obama, had been opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which had argued that it would saddle businesses with extra costs. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Hackers Find China Is Land Of Opportunity,"BEIJING -- Name a target anywhere in China, an official at a state-owned company boasted recently, and his crack staff will break into that person's computer, download the contents of the hard drive, record the keystrokes and monitor cellphone communications, too. Pitches like that, from a salesman for Nanjing Xhunter Software, were not uncommon at a crowded trade show this month that brought together Chinese law enforcement officials and entrepreneurs eager to win government contracts for police equipment and services. ''We can physically locate anyone who spreads a rumor on the Internet,'' said the salesman, whose company's services include monitoring online postings and pinpointing who has been saying what about whom. The culture of hacking in China is not confined to top-secret military compounds where hackers carry out orders to pilfer data from foreign governments and corporations. Hacking thrives across official, corporate and criminal worlds. Whether it is used to break into private networks, track online dissent back to its source or steal trade secrets, hacking is openly discussed and even promoted at trade shows, inside university classrooms and on Internet forums.  The Ministry of Education and Chinese universities, for instance, join companies in sponsoring hacking competitions that army talent scouts attend, though ''the standards can be mediocre,'' said a cybersecurity expert who works for a government institute and handed out awards at a 2010 competition. Corporations employ freelance hackers to spy on competitors. In an interview, a former hacker confirmed recent official news reports that one of China's largest makers of construction equipment had committed cyberespionage against a rival. One force behind the spread of hacking is the government's insistence on maintaining surveillance over anyone deemed suspicious. So local police departments contract with companies like Xhunter to monitor and suppress dissent, industry insiders say. Ai Weiwei, the dissident artist, said he had received three messages from Google around 2009 saying his e-mail account had been compromised, an increasingly common occurrence in China among people deemed subversive. When the police detained him in 2011, he said, they seized 200 pieces of computer equipment and other electronic hardware. ''They're so interested in computers,'' Mr. Ai said. ''Every time anyone is arrested or checked, the first thing they grab is the computer.'' There is criminal hacking, too. Keyboard jockeys break into online gaming programs and credit card databases to collect personal information. As in other countries, the police here have expressed growing concern. Some hackers see crime as more lucrative than legitimate work, but opportunities for skilled hackers to earn generous salaries abound, given the growing number of cybersecurity companies providing network defense services to the government, state-owned enterprises and private companies. ''I have personally provided services to the People's Liberation Army, the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of State Security,'' said a prominent former hacker who used the alias V8 Brother for this interview because he feared scrutiny by foreign governments. He said he had done the work as a contractor and described it as defensive, but declined to give details. And ''if you are a government employee, there could be secret projects or secret missions,'' the hacker said. But government jobs are usually not well paying or prestigious, and most skilled hackers prefer working for security companies that have cyberdefense contracts, as V8 Brother does, he and others in the industry say. Self-trained, the hacker teamed up with China's patriotic ''red hackers'' more than a decade ago. Then he began working for cybersecurity companies and was recently making $100,000 a year, he said. V8 Brother said this cyberworld was so arcane that senior Chinese officials did not know details about computer work at government agencies. ''You can't even explain to them what you're doing,'' he said. ''It's like explaining computer science to a construction worker.'' In Washington, officials criticize what they consider state-sponsored attacks. The officials say intrusions against foreign governments and businesses are growing, and the Pentagon this month accused the Chinese military of attacking American government computer systems and military contractors. The White House, which has ordered cyberattacks against Iran, has made cybersecurity a priority in talks with China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry says China opposes hacking attacks and is itself a victim. The furor in Washington intensified in February after The New York Times and other news organizations published details of hacking efforts against their own networks and the findings of a new report by a cybersecurity company, Mandiant. The report said a shadowy group within the People's Liberation Army, Unit 61398, ran a formidable hacking and espionage operation against foreign entities out of a building on the outskirts of Shanghai. In China, the unit is just one part of the complex universe of hacking and cybersecurity. And the military units are not a well-kept secret. At least four former employees of Unit 61786, responsible for cryptography and information security, have posted résumés on job-search Web sites listing employment in the unit. Another job seeker reported employment in Unit 61580; the unit has engineers specializing in ''computer network defense and attack,'' according to the Project 2049 Institute, a nongovernmental organization in Virginia that studies security and policy issues in Asia. Members of Unit 61398, the bureau mentioned by Mandiant, have written several papers on hacking and cybersecurity with professors at Shanghai Jiaotong University, which has a prominent information security department. Across China, the universities labeled jiaotong -- meaning communications -- are taking the lead in building such departments. The military recruits at the universities and runs its own training center, the P.L.A. Information Engineering University, in the city of Zhengzhou. But cybersecurity experts here say the schools often churn out students who know theory but lack practical skills. That could explain why many Chinese hacking attacks that have been discovered do not appear very sophisticated. American cybersecurity experts say attacks from Chinese groups often occur only from 9 to 5 Beijing time. And unlike, say, the Russians, Chinese hackers do not tend to cloak their movements, said Darien Kindlund, manager of the threat intelligence group for FireEye, a cybersecurity firm in Milpitas, Calif. ''They're using the least amount of sophistication necessary to accomplish their mission,'' Mr. Kindlund said. ''They have a lot of manpower available, but not necessarily a lot of intelligent manpower to conduct these operations stealthily.'' The culture of hacking began in China in the late 1990s. The most famous underground group then was Green Army. One sign of how hacking has gone mainstream is the fact that the name of a later incarnation of Green Army -- Lumeng -- is now used by a top cybersecurity company in China. (Its English name is NSFOCUS.) These companies are often started by prominent hackers or employ them to do network security. They have polished Web sites that list Chinese government agencies and companies as their clients. They also list foreign clients -- at least one company, Knownsec, lists Microsoft -- and have offices abroad. The Web site of another company, Venustech, says its clients include more than 100 government offices, among them almost all the military commands. The company, which declined an interview request, has a hacking and cyberdefense research center. Another former hacker said the monolithic notion of insidious, state-sponsored hacking now discussed in the West was absurd. The presence of the state throughout the economy means hackers often end up doing work for the government at some point, even if it is through something as small-scale as a contract with a local government office. ''I don't think the West understands,'' he said. ''China's government is so big. It's almost impossible to not have any crossover with the government.'' Private corporations in China are employing hackers for industrial espionage, in operations that involve complex tiers of agents who hire the hackers. Sany Group, one of China's biggest makers of construction equipment, hired hackers to spy on Zoomlion, a rival, according to official news media reports confirmed by the former hacker. Sany declined to comment. That hacker said he knew the middleman agent who had hired cyberspies for Sany. The agent was a security engineer who owned two apartments in Beijing and had been under pressure to meet mortgage payments. ''In China, everyone is struggling to feed themselves, so why should they consider values and those kinds of luxuries?'' the former hacker said. ''They work for one thing, and that's for money.'' "
Hunting for Syrian Hackers' Chain of Command,"It's the question of the moment inside the murky realm of cybersecurity: Just who -- or what -- is the Syrian Electronic Army? The hacking group that calls itself the S.E.A. struck again on Friday, this time breaking into the Twitter accounts and blog headlines of The Financial Times. The attack was part of a crusade that has targeted dozens of media outlets as varied as The Associated Press and The Onion, the parody news site. But just who is behind the S.E.A.'s cybervandalism remains a mystery. Paralleling the group's boisterous, pro-Syrian government activity has been a much quieter Internet surveillance campaign aimed at revealing the identities, activities and whereabouts of the Syrian rebels fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Now sleuths are trying to figure out how much overlap there is between the rowdy pranks playing out on Twitter and the silent spying that also increasingly includes the monitoring of foreign aid workers. It's a high-stakes search. If researchers prove the Assad regime is closely tied to the group, foreign governments may choose to respond because the attacks have real-world consequences. The S.E.A. nearly crashed the stock market, for example, by planting false tales of White House explosions in a recent hijacking of The A.P.'s Twitter feed.  The mystery is made more curious by the belief among researchers that the hackers currently parading as the S.E.A. are not the same people who started the pro-Assad campaign two years ago. Experts say the Assad regime benefits from the ambiguity. ''They have created extra space between themselves and international law and international opinion,'' said James A. Lewis, a security expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The S.E.A. emerged during the Syrian uprisings in May 2011, they said, to offer a pro-Assad counternarrative to news coming out of Syria. In speeches, Mr. Assad likened the S.E.A. to the government's own online security corps, referring to the group as ''a real army in a virtual reality.'' In its early incarnation, researchers said, the S.E.A. had a clearly defined hierarchy, with leaders, technical experts, a media arm and hundreds of volunteers. Several early members belonged to the Syrian Computer Society, a technical organization run by Mr. Assad before he became president. Until last month, digital records suggest, the Syrian Computer Society still ran much of the S.E.A.'s infrastructure. In April, a raid of S.E.A. Web domains revealed that the majority were still registered to the society. S.E.A. members initially created pro-Assad Facebook pages and spammed popular pages like President Obama's and Oprah Winfrey's with pro-Syrian comments. But by the fall of 2011, S.E.A. activities had become more premeditated. They defaced prominent Web sites like Harvard University's with pro-Assad messages, in an attack a spokesman characterized as sophisticated. At some point, the S.E.A.'s crucial players disappeared and a second crop of hackers took over. The current group consists of roughly a dozen new actors led by hackers who call themselves ''Th3 Pr0'' and ''The Shadow'' and function more like Anonymous, the loose hacking collective, than a state-sponsored brigade. In interviews, people who now identify as the S.E.A. insist they operate independently from the Assad regime. But researchers who have been following the group's digital trail aren't convinced. ''The opportunity for collaboration between the S.E.A. and regime is clear, but what is missing is proof,'' said Jacob West, a chief technology officer at Hewlett-Packard. As governments consider stronger responses to malicious cyberactivity, Mr. West said, ''the motivation for Syria to maintain plausible deniability is very, very real.'' Long before the S.E.A's apparent changing of the guard, security researchers unearthed a stealthier surveillance campaign targeting Syrian dissidents that has since grown to include foreign aid workers. Morgan Marquis-Boire, a researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, uncovered spyware with names like ''Dark Comet'' and ''BlackShades'' sending information back to a Syrian state-owned telecommunications company. The software -- which tracked a target's location, read e-mails and logged keystrokes -- disguised itself as an encryption service for Skype, a program used by many Syrian activists. Mr. Marquis-Boire has uncovered more than 200 Internet Protocol addresses running the spyware. Some were among the few kept online last week during an Internet disruption in Syria that the government blamed on a ''technical malfunction,'' but experts described as a systematic government shutdown. S.E.A. members deny spying on Syrian civilians. ''We didn't do that and we will not,'' the hacker who identifies himself as Th3 Pr0 wrote in an e-mail. ''Our targets are known,'' he wrote, referring to the group's public Twitter attacks. Researchers have tracked several of those attacks -- including that on The Onion and another against Human Rights Watch in March -- to a server in Russia, which they believe is redirecting attacks from Syria. Last weekend, researchers traced one attack back to a Syrian I.P. address registered to Syriatel, a telecommunications company owned by Rami Makhlouf, Mr. Assad's first cousin. Dissidents say that connection is proof the S.E.A. is backed by the Assad regime and claim that the Twitter attacks are just the outward-facing component of a deeper surveillance campaign. ''There is no doubt they are the same,'' said Dlshad Othman, a Syrian in Washington who helps dissidents get rid of the spyware. The smoking gun, Mr. Othman and others say, was an S.E.A. attack last year on Burhan Ghalioun, a Syrian opposition leader. Shortly after Mr. Ghalioun's Facebook page was hacked, it began serving spyware to fans. Mr. Ghalioun's e-mails also showed up on a S.E.A. leak site. The other potential link, they say, is a list of opposition leaders that surfaced in July, after S.E.A. members boasted they could help the regime quickly search for the names of opponents. Mr. Othman said the boasts were proof the S.E.A. worked with the regime and kept tabs on dissidents. Ironically, that opposition search most likely led to the S.E.A.'s internal shake-up. Activists say encryption on the document was cracked, and in July it popped up on Pastebin, a Web site for anonymous postings. ''There was a view that the government blamed the S.E.A. for the leak,'' said John Scott-Railton, a Citizen Lab research fellow. In the days that followed, Facebook accounts for known S.E.A. members went dark. S.E.A. aliases that researchers had been tracking suddenly vanished. New members with different monikers assumed the group's name. Researchers say the hackers behind the recent spate of Twitter hacks are far less organized. Outside Syria, the Twitter attacks made people take note of the S.E.A. But inside Syria, they barely registered. Dissidents there are more concerned with the mounting spyware infections and imprisonments. And researchers have seen the spyware tracking a new target: aid workers. ''The Syrian opposition are quite paranoid and aware of the stakes,'' Mr. Marquis-Boire said. ''But then you get foreign aid workers who show up to do good work, but are not as paranoid about their operational security.'' ''It's a smart move if you think about it,'' he added. "
Daily Report: Tech Giants Brace for More Scrutiny From Regulators,"Silicon Valley lobbied hard in Washington in 2012, and despite some friction with regulators, fared fairly well, reports Somini Sengupta in Wednesday's New York Times. In 2013, though, government scrutiny is likely to grow. And with this scrutiny will come even greater efforts by the tech industry to press its case in the nation's capital and overseas.  In 2012, among other victories, the industry staved off calls for federal consumer privacy legislation and successfully pushed for a revamp of an obscure law that had placed strict privacy protections on Americans' video rental records. It also helped achieve a stalemate on a proposed global effort to let Web users limit behavioral tracking online, using Do Not Track browser settings. But this year is likely to put that issue in the spotlight again, and bring intense negotiations between industry and consumer rights groups over whether and how to allow consumers to limit tracking. Congress is likely to revisit online security legislation - meant to safeguard critical infrastructure from attack - that failed last year. And a looming question for Web giants will be who takes the reins of the Federal Trade Commission, the industry's main regulator, this year. David C. Vladeck, the director of the commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, has resigned, and there have been suggestions that its chairman, Jon Leibowitz, would step down. The agency is investigating Google over possible antitrust violations and will subject Facebook to audits of its privacy policy for the next 20 years. Its next steps could serve as a bellwether of how aggressively the commission will take on Web companies in the second Obama administration.  "
Samsung Delays Release of Security Software for Galaxy Phones,"In February, Samsung Electronics introduced Knox, a version of Android with security features to make the company's phones more suitable for businesses, expected for release this spring. But the company has delayed the release of the software until summer, according to two people briefed on the company's plans.  Samsung initially said Knox would launch on the Galaxy S4, which is to  arrive in AT&T stores on Saturday. But two people working with Samsung on Knox, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak about their relationships with the company, said Samsung had decided to delay the release because it needed more time to test the software internally and with carriers. Samsung informed one of these people that Knox would be out around July. Knox is expected to ship on some Samsung Galaxy devices. Analysts say the software puts Samsung, the leading manufacturer of Android devices, in a position to replace BlackBerry as the phone for professionals. Samsung's spokespeople confirmed that a full version of Knox would not be available until a later date. ""All the Knox framework components come standard on the device, with full-feature activation by solution providers and distribution channels to become available at a later date,"" the company said in a statement.

2 Deterrents To Robocalls Win Contest By F.T.C.,"WASHINGTON -- Caller ID, Do Not Call registries, telephone number blocking -- all entered the arsenal of consumer weapons against telemarketers to great acclaim, only to fall from favor as growing numbers of cold-calling solicitors found ways around them. Now, the Federal Trade Commission again says it might have found a better solution. On Tuesday, it named the winners of its first Robocall Challenge, a public contest to design a system to stop unsolicited marketing calls from reaching an individual's phone.  The winners, who split a $50,000 prize, are Aaron Foss, a software developer from Long Island, and Serdar Danis, a computer engineer who declined to reveal his hometown. Mr. Foss conceived Nomorobo, a way to use a phone system's talents against itself to build a blacklist of threatening numbers. Mr. Danis came up with the less creatively named Robocall Filtering System and Device with Autonomous Blacklisting, Whitelisting, Graylisting and Caller ID Spoof Detection. A separate Technology Achievement Award, with no monetary prize, went to Daniel Klein and Dean Jackson, Google engineers in Pittsburgh, for a sort of crowdsourced database of annoying telemarketers' phone numbers. ''The solutions that our winners came up with have the potential to turn the tide on illegal robocalls,'' Charles Harwood, acting director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. ''We're hoping these winning proposals find their way to the marketplace soon, and will provide relief to millions of American consumers harassed by these calls.'' They might, but it will take months. Mr. Harwood said the F.T.C. was not endorsing any commercial products, and the inventors will have to deal with intellectual property issues and concerns about privacy and data security. Mr. Foss expressed optimism about attracting an investor to help him commercialize his concept. ''It still needs to be fleshed out a little bit,'' he said in an interview. ''We'll need to see how it works with real data and real people.'' Nomorobo uses the simultaneous ringing feature that is available on most phone systems and allows a user to have an incoming call ring at several numbers at once. Mr. Foss's system, he said, splits the call and routes it to a server, which analyzes the incoming data and uses ''machine learning'' to build a database of acceptable and prohibited numbers and calling patterns. The system answers a rejected call, and then hangs up. Incorrectly categorized or unrecognized calls are screened before ringing through to the user. The other winners similarly use algorithms to build a database of blacklisted numbers with which to screen incoming calls. The systems have the potential to be used on home or cellphones. The F.T.C. and the Federal Communications Commission already enforce regulations against sending prerecorded sales calls to households without the written consent of the recipient. Nevertheless, the F.T.C. says robocalls are its most persistent problem, generating roughly 200,000 consumer complaints each month, even though the agency says it has stopped many of the businesses responsible for the billions of robocalls made each year. In recent years, ''the technology has developed so that it's extremely cheap and easy to send out millions of calls instantly,'' said Kati Daffan, who oversaw the robocall project for the F.T.C. With millions of calls and hundreds of thousands of customers complaining, do phone companies have a stake in trying to solve the problem? ''I have to wonder if it's just not a priority of theirs,'' Mr. Foss said. ''Maybe this will shine a light on it, and the phone companies will take it seriously.'' "
Web Privacy Becomes A Business Imperative,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Privacy is no longer just a regulatory headache. Increasingly, Internet companies are pushing each other to prove to consumers that their data is safe and in their control. In some instances, established companies are trying to gain market advantage by casting themselves as more privacy-friendly than their rivals. For example, Mozilla, an underdog in the browser market, suggested last week that it would allow its users to disable third-party tracking software altogether. At the same time, Web platform companies are setting limits on other companies with which they do business. Last year, for instance, Apple began requiring applications in its operating system to get permission from users before tracking their location or peering into calendars and contacts stored on an iPhone. Also, a host of companies big and small are offering a variety of privacy tools like ways to encode Facebook posts and ways to secure personal data stored in the cloud. During a panel at the RSA Conference, a security-focused industry gathering here last week, Brendon Lynch, chief privacy officer at Microsoft, declared that companies like his had come to appreciate the ''market forces at play with privacy.''  ''It's not just privacy advocates and regulators pushing,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''Increasingly, people are concerned more about privacy as technology intersects their life.'' That statement might sound somewhat odd to those who recall Microsoft's troubles 10 years ago with European regulators. At that time, it was compelled to make substantial changes to how its online login system, .Net Passport, stored addresses, ages and other personal details. Nonetheless, earlier this year, Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., signaled its sensitivity to user privacy by turning on, by default, an antitracking signal in its latest Internet Explorer browser. Microsoft also took aim at its rival Google with a marketing campaign declaring that consumers were being ''scroogled'' with targeted advertisements based on their e-mails and search histories. Mr. Lynch's counterpart at Google, Keith Enright, called that marketing campaign ''intellectually dishonest.'' At the RSA Conference, Mr. Enright said Google took pains to secure consumer information and simplify privacy settings. Joel R. Reidenberg, a professor at Fordham Law School, said Microsoft had made a 180-degree turn in emphasizing consumer data protection. ''You're seeing more companies trying to do that -- develop privacy protecting services,'' said Professor Reidenberg, whose Center on Law and Information Policy at Fordham has received donations from both Microsoft and Google. ''Platforms recognize they have to deal with privacy. They're looking at how they can be competitive.'' To some degree, these developments signal that the industry is working hard to stave off government regulation, which is moving at a glacial pace anyway. There seems to be no movement on broad privacy legislation on Capitol Hill, and no consensus has been reached on standards for ''Do Not Track,'' a browser setting that would let Internet users indicate that they did not want their activity tracked by marketers. Advertisers have said openly that they will not stop tracking just because a consumer sends a Do Not Track signal through his or her browser. Facebook has said it needs more clarity on whether a Do Not Track signal applies, for instance, to social plug-ins like the Facebook ''like'' button, which is integrated into millions of Web sites. Still, companies are refining the controls users have over their data, on mobile devices as well as on desktop computers. In addition to requiring applications to seek user permission before tracking location, Apple has included in its latest mobile operating system a way for users to disable or reset a series of digits that identify a particular device for tracking purposes. The Advertising Identifier, as it is called, replaces what was an immutable unique device identifier. It allows app developers to monitor user behavior, but it also gives consumers the option of turning it off. Facebook requires applications in its App Center to offer customers a privacy policy, and last year it introduced privacy controls that let users fine-tune who sees which posts and pictures. In 2011, Google sought to distinguish its social networking tool, Google Plus, as privacy-sensitive. It introduced the idea of ''circles'' as a way to limit sharing certain things with certain people. Market rivalry does not mean that companies are not worried about regulatory scrutiny of their use of personal data. Facebook agreed to 20 years of audits by the Federal Trade Commission after the agency found that the company had deceived consumers by making data public that they had intended to be private. In a measure of change, Facebook began nudging its users to review their privacy settings before they could start using the new search tool the company introduced this year. ''What does privacy mean?'' Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, asked at the RSA Conference. ''It's understanding what happens to your data and having the ability to control it.'' That very imperative seems to be buoying a cottage industry of privacy start-ups. A Boston-based company, Abine, is testing what is effectively the opposite of a Facebook single sign-in for the Web. Instead of exposing your Facebook login credentials to dozens of Web sites, the company offers a proxy e-mail address or phone number for every transaction. You sign in with the e-mail address and a password you remember; Abine creates one address for an e-commerce site you visit, another for a news site, another for a dating site. Abine offers the basic service for free and plans to charge a monthly fee for more advanced features. Another company, Wave Systems, showed off its new consumer privacy tool on the RSA exhibition floor last week. Named Scrambls, it encrypts a social network post or e-mail, effectively locking it, and lets the author choose who should have a key to read it. The company plans to market Scrambls to parents, among others, as ''a seat belt'' to protect their children on social media. For now, it is free. Whether Internet users are ready to pay to protect their personal data is unclear, though surveys have repeatedly pointed to consumer anxiety. In a national survey last year, Forrester Research found that one in three consumers were concerned about companies having access to their behavioral data. More than 40 percent said they had stopped short of completing a transaction on a Web site because of something they read in a privacy policy. Consumer trust is an increasingly vital commodity for Web companies, said Fatemeh Khatibloo, a Forrester analyst. ''There's enough market traction and momentum from the consumer side and the business side to drive this forward,'' Ms. Khatibloo said. Mozilla, which makes the Firefox browser, ruffled the feathers of the online advertising industry when it announced that it was testing a new tool that blocked third-party tracking software, known as cookies. The company said it had not made a final decision on whether to incorporate the tool into its browser, though some version of it was likely to be included. Already, said Alex Fowler, Mozilla's chief privacy officer, nearly 12 percent of desktop users of Firefox and 14 percent of Firefox users on Google's Android mobile operating system have turned on the Do Not Track signal. ''They're asking for a different level of privacy on your service,'' he said. ''You have to listen to that. It's critical to your business.'' "
Europe Continues Wrestling With Online Privacy Rules,"BRUSSELS -- More than a year ago, the European Union's top justice official proposed a tough set of measures for protecting the privacy of personal data online. But because of intense lobbying by Silicon Valley companies and other powerful groups in Brussels, several proposals have been softened, no agreement is in sight and governments are openly sparring with one another over how far to go in protecting privacy. On Thursday, justice ministers from the European Union's 27 member states agreed to a business-friendly proposal that what companies do with personal data would be scrutinized by regulators only if there were ''risks'' to individuals, including identity theft or discrimination.  The ministers debated a proposal that would no longer require companies to obtain ''explicit'' consent from users whose personal data they collect and process, instead of ''unambiguous'' consent, which is considered to be a lower legal threshold. And they discussed a proposal on balancing an individual's right to data protection with other rights, including the freedom to do business. The ministers deferred discussion of the other most fractious provision, the so-called right to be forgotten. But in recent weeks, public comments by lawmakers and draft language suggested a softening of approach. ''The right to be forgotten has been softened, made more palatable,'' said Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, professor of Internet governance at the University of Oxford. ''But it is by no means dead.'' Although a final version of the legislation is not expected to be completed for many months, and maybe not until next year, the developments on Thursday are an early signal that the technology industry's lobbying efforts are gaining some traction. The lobbying has been ''exceptional'' and legislators in Europe need ''to guard against undue pressure from industry and third countries to lower the level of data protection that currently exists,'' said Peter Hustinx, the European data protection supervisor, referring to countries outside of the European Union. ''The benefits for industry should not and do not need to be at the expense of our fundamental rights to privacy and data protection,'' Mr. Hustinx warned in e-mailed comments. In the last year, American technology companies have dispatched representatives to Brussels and issued white papers through industry associations arguing that stringent privacy regulations would hamstring businesses, already suffering from the recession in Europe. United States government officials have also made trips across the Atlantic to press policy makers like Viviane Reding, the union's justice commissioner, who drafted the original, strict measures, to press for a less restrictive approach to data privacy. The industry's arguments have found a ready audience among some European governments. They include Ireland and Britain, where there are acute worries that the European Union is failing to take advantage of growth opportunities from Internet businesses that might help revive the economy. Apple, Facebook and Google all have European headquarters in Dublin. ''Europe is not sleepwalking into unworkable regulations,'' said Richard Allan, Facebook's director of policy for Europe, echoing a cautious optimism among industry officials about the data privacy law. ''What's positive is that over the last year, the debate has broadened out. There are other voices in the debate, who are saying: 'Hang on a minute. What about the economic crisis?' '' The proposed law would affect most companies that deal in personal information -- including pictures posted on social networks or information on what people buy on retail sites or look for using a search engine. Whatever is enacted would serve as the privacy law in every country in the European Union and potentially have a bearing on other countries drafting data protection laws of their own. The ministers took up their version of the law on Thursday; another version is under discussion by the European Parliament. The Parliament is considering its version while intense lobbying is being conducted by companies, governments and other organizations that have submitted about 4,000 amendments. The various versions will need to be reconciled before they can become law. ''Ultimately, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,'' Alan Shatter, the Irish justice minister, who was the chairman of Thursday's meeting, told his colleagues. The liberal-leaning language on obtaining consent from Web users was suggested by the Irish. Another provision the Irish suggested would remove the restriction on companies to collect only a ''minimum'' amount of data. That could be important for any company that wants to use the data it collects in new ways. But Chris Grayling, the British justice secretary, said those concessions were not enough. He said the rules were still overly burdensome for European businesses, along with United States technology giants. Although the most contentious provision -- the right to be forgotten -- did not come up on Thursday, language is circulating that could limit it. The provision as originally conceived would enable users to demand that their accumulated data be deleted forever. But it has raised questions about what to do with data that is in turn shared with third-party companies. The softer language would tweak it so that the data may not necessarily disappear from the Internet as a whole, but be scrubbed from the site where it was originally posted. The shift, said David A. Hoffman, global privacy officer for Intel, shows ''a much greater degree of nuance.'' Mr. Hoffman added, ''They are going to move it much closer to a more limited, balanced ability for individuals to access their data and then to request their data be corrected, amended or deleted.'' That is fairly close to what exists in most European countries now. Also still to be debated are the sanctions for breaking the law, which could include fines of up to 2 percent of a company's annual worldwide sales. Ms. Reding sharply disagreed with some of the modifications put forth by the Irish. And she won strong backing during the meeting from Italy and France for maintaining robust rules requiring companies to give consumers every chance to guard their privacy online. The French justice minister, Christiane Taubira, said at the meeting: ''Not saying anything is not the same thing as saying yes, so we think it's very important that we have explicit consent. We have to protect people.'' "
E.U. Reaction to Data Sharing Revelations Grew Slowly,"BERLIN -- While Europe was in an uproar Sunday over a magazine's charge that Washington bugged European Union offices in the United States, the backlash on another type of intrusion has been surprisingly muted, namely the disclosure that U.S. technology leaders -- Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo -- may have shared E.U. citizens' personal data with an American surveillance program called Prism. On a continent where courts have ruled that access to the Internet is a fundamental human right, the disclosure last month of the covert program drew criticism from privacy officials and activists in Britain, France and Germany.  But the volume in Europe on privacy issues has been greater than the actual movement on the ground: Initial reactions to the leak by Edward J. Snowden, a former worker at the U.S. National Security Agency, have not led to concrete demands for greater controls on data sharing or stricter privacy controls that could hinder the operations of those U.S. technology giants in Europe. In Brussels, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers are working to update the 1995 data protection law covering the E.U. countries. While the earlier Prism disclosures had given more ammunition to proponents of stricter privacy controls, their effect on the debate has seemed limited. ''The Prism revelations have made parliamentarians more receptive to stronger measures,'' said Joe McNamee, the executive director of European Digital Rights, a Brussels group advocating greater restrictions in data sharing between the European Union and the United States. ''But the reaction has not been as strong as we had hoped for.'' Before the allegations in the magazine Der Spiegel that the United States has bugged E.U. offices, the full European Parliament had been scheduled to debate a resolution on Wednesday that would have at least expressed concern about the broad nature of Prism and its collection of private data from E.U. residents. The resolution was also expected to do the same about a British program, Tempora, which involved tapping undersea communication cables. It was unclear whether the debate -- and a vote set for Thursday -- would still be held, but the resolution was likely to have been moderate in tone to reflect support for U.S. security concerns, and it was not intended to carry any force of law. ''There are those in Parliament who want a hard line where the E.U. doesn't share any data with the United States, but this is a minority,'' said a legislative staff worker in Brussels who was involved in negotiations to draft a compromise resolution on the issue. The aide, who works for one of the Parliament's most senior members, declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the topic. Meanwhile, a student group in Austria asked regulators in Ireland, Germany and Luxembourg on Wednesday to bar the European arms of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo from sending the personal data of E.U. citizens to the United States for processing. The group, Europe-v-Facebook.org, formed two years ago to protest the social network's privacy policies in Europe, is arguing that the existence of Prism proves that the United States cannot guarantee the necessary ''adequate level of protection'' required of countries that are certified to process the personal data of E.U. citizens. ''There is a reasonable suspicion that there is widespread surveillance,'' Max Schrems, the founder of the group, said. Mr. Schrems, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Vienna, said the group's best chance of obtaining sanctions might be in Germany, which has the strictest data protection laws in the Union. The Austrian group filed a complaint with the data protection regulator in Bavaria, a German state where Yahoo has a large office, asking that restrictions be placed on the company's U.S.-bound data transfers. Spokesmen for Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo declined to comment on the complaint. Google was not included in the initial complaints, Mr. Schrems said, because Europeans who sign up for its services contract directly with Google in America, not with its European subsidiaries. (The German complaint focused on Yahoo because of its big office in Munich. The Irish complaint focused on Apple and Facebook because they have large offices in Dublin. The Luxembourg complaint focused on Microsoft, whose Skype subsidiary is in Luxembourg.) On Thursday, the Bavarian regulator transferred the case to the German federal data protection commissioner, Peter Schaar. In a June 7 blog post, Mr. Schaar had described the existence and reach of the Prism program as ''outrageous,'' adding that such systematic surveillance without prior judicial consent would be illegal in Germany. But it was unclear whether his office could block any data transfer activity by Yahoo's German headquarters in Munich. Juliane Heinrich, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schaar in Berlin, said the German regulator was analyzing the issue of jurisdiction to determine whether and how to proceed against Yahoo. The Brussels-based American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union said it supported an E.U.-U.S. government dialogue on the data transfer issue. ''Prism needs to be addressed at government level,'' said Anna McNally of the American Chamber. "
Europe Aims To Regulate The Cloud,"LONDON -- The words ''cloud computing'' never appeared in a 119-page digital privacy regulation introduced in Europe last year. They do now. Even before revelations this summer by Edward J. Snowden on the extent of spying by the National Security Agency on electronic communications, the European Parliament busied itself attaching amendments to its data privacy regulation. Several would change the rules of cloud computing, the technology that enables the sharing of software and files among computers on the Internet. And since the news broke of widespread monitoring by the United States spy agency, cloud computing has become one of the regulatory flash points in Brussels as a debate ensued over how to protect data from snooping American eyes. Cloud technology has become a routine part of digital life, whether it is used for Web-based services to send e-mail or store photographs or to warehouse troves of business or government records. It has enabled the convenient sharing of data among mobile devices and enhanced the ability of people to collaborate and share documents. It has also cut the cost of doing business.  But transmitting data among mobile phones, tablet computers and clouds, even while encrypted, makes it more accessible to snooping. The European Union wants to regulate the cloud even if that makes its use more complicated. One proposed amendment would require ''all transfers of data'' from a cloud in the European Union to a cloud maintained in the United States or elsewhere to ''be accompanied with a notification to the data subject of such transfer and its legal effects.'' Another amendment takes it further, barring such transfers unless several conditions are met. Not only must consent be provided by the subject of the data, but the person must be ''informed in clear, unambiguous and warning language through a separate and prominently visible reference'' to ''the possibility of the personal data being subject to intelligence gathering or surveillance by third-country authorities.'' Lawmakers are also proposing to revive an amendment that American diplomats largely succeeded in getting dropped from the original data privacy regulation that would impose guidelines for handling court orders from countries outside the European Union. The amendment requires the operator of data servers to inform both a local ''supervisory authority'' as well as the subject of the request, which could run afoul of American law. And there are other potential conflicts between European and American laws. The European Commission is considering imposing sanctions on companies that turn over records to American law enforcement authorities if the move violates European privacy regulations. While policy-making on cloud computing is proceeding on more than one track in Brussels, the tracks all appear to be heading in the same general direction: a more robust regulatory regime delineating how data is handled and released. Policy makers hope to have a new regulation in place before the European elections next May. The stances from politicians across the European Union are similar. ''We need to realize that European citizens will not embrace the cloud if they are worried for their privacy or for the security of their data,'' said Neelie Kroes, the European Commission vice president in charge of telecommunications and information policy, in a statement. Viviane Reding, the European Commission's justice minister, said in her own statement that she wanted to see ''the development of European clouds'' certified to strict new European standards. She said that European governments could promote such a move ''by making sure that data processed by them are only stored in clouds to which E.U. data protection laws and European jurisdiction applies.'' ''For the private sector, such European clouds could become also attractive as they could advertise, 'These are European clouds, so your personal data is safe,' '' she said. Some have gone further. Thierry Breton, a former French finance minister and the chief executive of a French information technology company called Atos, has proposed what he called a ''Schengen for data,'' referring to the law that allows citizens within the euro zone to cross borders without a passport. But creating a virtual free trade zone for data -- if such a thing is possible -- raises questions about what happens outside that zone. A spokesman for Mr. Breton, who is on a panel advising the commission's strategy on cloud computing, said that his statement was ''not about protectionism'' but about ensuring ''customers will receive the proper level of guarantees in terms of data protection and access across Europe.'' It is not entirely clear what creating European clouds would really entail, or how one would draw digital borders. Large American providers of cloud services, like Amazon, have data centers throughout Europe. And even European companies with American subsidiaries are vulnerable to American law enforcement requests, a point of contention between the governments. American technology companies, as well as the American government, have voiced unease publicly and privately. In a recent speech, Cameron F. Kerry, the general counsel of the United States Commerce Department, said: ''It would be a sad outcome of the surveillance disclosures if they led to an approach to Internet policy-making and governance in which countries became a series of walled gardens with governments holding the keys to locked gates.'' ''But that is where we will end up if all data has to stay on servers located in the nation in which a citizen lives or where a device is,'' he said. In his view, the regulation might restrict the flow of information among citizens, as is the case in China with barriers that are called the Great Firewall. ''The digital world does not need another Great Firewall -- in Europe or anywhere else.'' Anna-Verena Naether, policy manager for DigitalEurope, a trade group of international technology companies, including American and European giants like Apple, Microsoft and SAP, said, ''We have to make sure it doesn't lead to a Fortress Europe approach.'' Mark Taylor, a partner at the London office of Hogan Lovells, a law firm that represents a number of businesses that use cloud services, as well as companies that provide it, said, ''There's a risk of going too far and effectively putting a significant element of this in reverse, and in the current economic situation my feeling is you have to be jolly careful about anything that's going to have a broader economic impact.'' In addition to the debate over the digital privacy legislation, the European Commission created the European Cloud Partnership last year as part of a broader strategy to promote cloud computing. A mix of public officials and industry executives serve on its steering board. One of them, Reinhard Posch, an Austrian government official, said Europe should move toward ''fostering a functioning single market for cloud computing.'' But that does not necessarily mean putting walls around where data can be stored, he said. ''We have to get a little deeper than just to talk about where the bits are stored,'' he said. ''The bits may be stored anywhere; it's more the question of how are they secured.'' Sophia in 't Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament who sponsored one of the cloud computing amendments, said, ''This extreme market dominance of a few American players is very unhealthy, but I am against putting a fence around Europe and excluding anybody. But it has to be very clear what the rules are that we play by and there has to be more competition from Europe.'' "
"Europe, Lost on the Digital Planet","PARIS -- A decade ago, on a visit to the U.S. Embassy here with a colleague for an interview, we were asked to leave our cellphones at the security gate. This was a new experience. We smiled, amused by this James Bond attitude. What kind of threat could these small, innocent phones -- still dumb, not yet smart, at the time -- possibly pose? They might, we were told, be used as listening devices. Looking back, I wonder who might have been listening on whom. Following Edward J. Snowden's leaks about wiretaps by the National Security Agency, the irony of this episode is obvious now.  Like our phones, we are smarter than we were 10 years ago. And thanks to Mr. Snowden, we now know what can be done with these small machines on which we have come to depend. Thanks to our constant use of electronic connections, our whole life is out there in the cloud, summed up in four letters: data. Sometimes we feel that the cloud knows more about ourselves than we do. And we fear that the data sitting there are up for grabs, unprotected. If the N.S.A. has no effective limits on its reach, surely our conception of privacy must be rethought. President Obama, questioned about the scope of the Prism electronic surveillance program, initially told his fellow Americans (not quite accurately, it turned out): ''With respect to the Internet and e-mails, this does not apply to U.S. citizens, and it does not apply to people living in the United States.'' We Europeans got the message. One European, in particular, owes Mr. Snowden big time. Viviane Reding, the European Union's justice commissioner, had been preaching in the wilderness for 18 months, trying to push a new private-data protection law. Earlier this year, intense lobbying by the American Internet industry and government, as well as opposition from members -- notably Britain, Ireland, Germany and Sweden -- forced her to soften her far-reaching proposals. But then the N.S.A. scandal changed the dynamic. On July 14, Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a strict European agreement on data protection. ''Internet companies which are operating in Europe, such as Facebook and Google, must give European countries information about whom they have given data to,'' she said. Five days later, French and German ministers gave their support to the commission's efforts. ''Thank you, Mr. Snowden!'' Ms. Reding proclaimed. On Oct. 7-8, the 28 E.U. justice ministers met to discuss the establishment of a ''one-stop shop'' for complaints regarding the protection of personal data. The N.S.A. leaks also gave new impetus to the fight for data privacy in the European Parliament, which has been actively pushing its own reforms. A young German M.E.P. and the rapporteur of the draft law, Jan Philipp Albrecht, is incensed that the U.S. government hasn't provided any explanations. Anyone who has seen the Oscar-winning 2006 film ''The Lives of Others,'' about the eavesdropping of the Communist Stasi, can understand why the Prism revelations hit a raw nerve in Germany. Along with Ms. Reding, so fiery that the mere mention of her name causes diplomats to roll their eyes, the quieter E.U. commissioner for home affairs, Cecilia Malmström, bluntly told her U.S. counterparts on July 4 that ''mutual trust and confidence have been seriously eroded.'' On Sept. 11, she told the under secretary of the U.S. Treasury, David S. Cohen, that she was ''waiting for substantial information on the alleged access and processing of personal data of E.U. citizens by the U.S.'' This tapping would seem to violate two hard-fought agreements, concluded after 9/11, that gave the United States limited access to European financial and travel data. But Ms. Malmström feels the United States is stonewalling. ''I am not satisfied with what we have received so far,'' she told a European Parliament hearing on Sept. 24. Outside of Brussels, though, the European powers have been more muted in their outrage -- at least compared with leaders like Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, who postponed an official visit to Washington, furious that her conversations had been listened to. Some European governments -- get ready to be surprised -- happen to engage in large-scale spying on foreign targets. Ireland is the European base of huge American tech companies. The British government, whose data sharing with the United States through trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cables was exposed by Mr. Snowden, has pressured The Guardian, one of the organizations that broke the N.S.A. story. The big takeaway may be that Europe has come to realize how dependent and powerless it is on this new digital planet. Fleur Pellerin, the French digital economy minister, laments that Europe doesn't have a major Internet company. The Web giants -- the French call them ''GAFA,'' for Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon -- monopolize the value of data, she says, including data collected from 500 million Europeans. There is no European GAFA to turn to. We joke that China has no Steve Jobs, but it's also true that Europe has no Google. Europe had Nokia, but it was sold to Microsoft. Ms. Pellerin supports a European regulatory regime for digital platforms, which will be taken up at an E.U. summit meeting on digital innovation, on Oct. 24-25. But it will be an uphill battle: Britain's Internet interests align with America's, and Sweden considers its national privacy-protection system to be adequate, with no need for another level of E.U. oversight. The French scientist Stéphane Grumbach, an expert on big data, contends that ''if the U.S. puts so much emphasis on this industry, it is also because the data it collects around the world gives it so much information.'' As things stand, he told me, the Euro-American digital conversation is simply ''a dialogue between a colonial power and colonized countries.'' L'affaire Snowden has raised crucial questions on privacy and control of the Internet. To European citizens, the claim from Silicon Valley lobbyists that any E.U. regulation would create a ''Fortress Europe,'' destroying their business model and killing innovation, doesn't sound so innocent. It just doesn't fly -- not even to the cloud. Sylvie Kauffmann is the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde. INTERNATIONAL NEW YORK TIMES "
Europe Moves to Shield Citizens' Data,"BRUSSELS -- Lawmakers here have introduced a measure in the European Parliament that could require American companies like Google and Yahoo to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The measure, an amendment to a broader electronic privacy law pending in Parliament, is a response to Prism, the secret spying program led by the National Security Agency that came to light in June. Europeans were outraged by the revelations that some of the biggest American Internet companies, many of whose users live in Europe, were required by the United States authorities to share information in e-mail, Web searches and other online data. Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs may vote on the amendment as soon as Monday, said Jan Philipp Albrecht, the German member who is responsible for steering the legislation through the Parliament. His office later clarified that the vote could be delayed until Thursday. Once it wins approval by the committee, Mr. Albrecht may begin negotiations on the Parliament's behalf with European governments, which are discussing their own version of new privacy rules.  But a European Union official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the vote could be further delayed if the United States intervened or if there was heavy lobbying by tech industry groups that oppose the bill. The American government successfully lobbied against a similar move by European officials two years ago. The reports about the N.S.A.'s activities gave European privacy rights proponents new incentive to pursue the matter again. Mr. Albrecht briefed reporters on the amendment on Thursday, saying it was meant to end a system in which European citizens have scant data protection from American law enforcement agencies. ''What happens today is that companies transfer personal data from Europe to a third state like the United States without having a legal base in European Union law,'' he said. If the measure becomes law, Mr. Albrecht said, companies ''will be forbidden to do that.'' A spokesman for the United States mission to the European Union declined to comment on Thursday. Messages seeking comment from Yahoo received no response. Google declined to comment. The measure would obligate companies not based in the European Union to nonetheless comply with European data protection rules if they operate in Europe. Violators could face fines of as much as 5 percent of a company's global annual revenue. The amendment would require companies to seek approval from a ''supervisory authority'' in a bloc country before transferring data on a person's individual electronic communications, whether phone calls, e-mails, Web searches or social media interactions, outside the union at the request of a foreign government or court. The broader privacy legislation has been debated for more than two years. Mr. Albrecht said he would like a final draft of the legislation to be approved by the spring and to go into effect two years later. That plan could be stymied by intense lobbying by Silicon Valley companies and other powerful groups in Brussels -- and by sparring among European governments about how far to go in protecting privacy. Ireland, Britain and other countries are concerned that the European Union is failing to take advantage of growth opportunities from Internet businesses that might help revive the economy. Apple, Facebook and Google all have European headquarters in Dublin. Even if the new rules are approved, existing bilateral agreements between individual European governments and the United States might keep data flowing across the Atlantic as part of efforts to fight terror and crime.

Protecting Data Privacy,"To the Editor: For many years, consumer privacy organizations urged Internet companies to adopt better practices to safeguard the personal information they collected. As data services expanded, we asked the companies to minimize collection when possible and to delete data when it was no longer necessary to keep.  When cloud services were first offered, we proposed routine encryption for stored user data. We recommended segregating credit files and cautioned against the consolidation of user profiles. We urged the companies to support necessary updates to privacy laws that would lead to the adoption of new privacy-enhancing techniques. And when Google and the National Security Agency entered into a secret arrangement in 2010 about Internet security, we brought an open government lawsuit to make the agreement public. Companies were often reluctant to adopt these security measures, arguing cost, convenience and trade secrets. They said that self-regulation was adequate and no new laws were necessary. Now we learn that vast amounts of user data have been unlawfully acquired by the N.S.A. and that companies are scrambling to implement new security practices to protect against our own government agencies (''Angry Over U.S. Surveillance, Tech Giants Bolster Defenses,'' front page, Nov. 1). Perhaps it is time to rethink the cloud computing model. The risks are too high. The safeguards are too weak. And the companies are not prepared to carry the responsibility of gathering so much user data. MARC ROTENBERG Washington, Nov. 4, 2013 The writer is president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. "
"For Congress, a Question of Cellphone Tracking","While the Senate considered an overhaul of a sweeping quarter-century-old law governing e-mail privacy, a House Judiciary Committee panel received dueling arguments on Thursday over when and how police can track the location of Americans carrying a cellphone. For investigators, knowing where a suspect is and at what time can be crucial to an investigation. Cellphones have become a powerful tool for establishing those facts - one detective scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill Thursday described them in prepared remarks as a ""witness"" to a crime. Less clear is the law on how authorities can extract that information from cellphones.   Law enforcement officials say procuring a search warrant, based on probable cause, is too time-consuming and slows down an investigation.  ""Geolocation evidence is essential to obtain in the early stages of investigations when probable cause has not been established,"" Peter A. Modafferi, chief of detectives in Rockland County, N.Y., said in his written testimony posted on the committee's Web site. ""Requiring probable cause to get basic, limited information about a person's historical location would make it significantly more difficult to solve crimes and seek justice for victims."" The law is vague on what information cellphone carriers must turn over to law enforcement and whether the officials require judicial review. Under what circumstances can police obtain a ""tower dump,"" meaning identify cellphone users whose devices pinged off a particular cellphone tower? Should a warrant be required to monitor the location of an individual with whom a known suspect is communicating? Should a warrant be required for specific location information of a known suspect? There is no consensus in the law on these questions. In the confusion, the police across the country follow a wide range of practices, and courts have ruled in vastly different ways. Pending legislation seeks to tighten privacy protections around the location data captured by cellphones. Thursday's hearing aired a range of opinions on this.  Catherine Crump, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, described in her written remarks the modern cellphone as an ""invasive yet inexpensive"" way to track the movement of ordinary Americans. She said that the police should be required to obtain a search warrant to demonstrate they have a good reason to track someone's whereabouts. ""The warrant and probable cause requirements,"" she said, ""ensure that an objective magistrate determines that there is a good reason to believe that a search will turn up evidence of wrongdoing before mobile phone location data is disclosed."" The A.C.L.U., through a Freedom of Information Act request in 2010, discovered how long telecommunications carriers retained the location data of their users. Verizon reported at the time that it stores cell tower data for ""one rolling year,"" Ms. Crump told members of Congress; T-Mobile kept it ""officially four to six months""; Sprint and Nextel for 18 to 24 months; and AT&T since July 2008. The Supreme Court's most important decision on location privacy came in January 2012, when the justices unanimously ruled that police had violated the Constitution's protection from unreasonable search when they placed a Global Positioning System tracking device on a suspect's car. They were divided on their rationale for the decision, but a majority suggested they were ambivalent about other forms of digital surveillance, including location data from cellphone towers.  "
Health Sites Under Scrutiny Over Mining of Data,"Millions of people rely on Web sites like WebMD and Health.com for information about depression, sexually transmitted diseases, cancer and other sensitive personal health issues. But it can be difficult for consumers to understand how health sites may capture, analyze and share information about user searches and other activities - even the small minority of people who manage to slog all the way through the privacy policies. In an effort to increase industry transparency, Lisa Madigan, the attorney general of Illinois, has opened an inquiry into the data-mining practices of some popular health sites.  On Tuesday, she sent letters to officials at eight sites asking for detailed information about their companies' data collection, data storage and data sharing practices. The sites included: about.com; drugs.com; health.com; mayoclinic.com; menshealth.com; mercola.com; WebMd.com; and weightwatchers.com. In the letters to the sites' executives, Ms. Madigan said she was concerned about the potential dissemination of information related to people's private health concerns. ""Health-related information, which would be protected from disclosure when said in a doctor's office, can be captured, shared, and sold when entered into a Web site,"" she wrote. ""These concerns are likely overlooked by consumers, as the disclosures about capturing and sharing their information are often buried in privacy policies not found on websites' main pages."" WebMD's privacy policy, for example, says that the site does not make a user's personal information - like a name or address - available to third parties for marketing purposes. But third parties, the privacy policy says, may use non-personal data to target WebMD users with ads related to their interests. The policy added that WebMD may combine personal and nonpersonal information about users on the site, or may collate that data with information gathered from external sources. Risa Fisher, a spokeswoman for WebMD, said that the company had just received Ms. Madigan's letter of inquiry and planned to provide the information she requested about its user data practices. ""Privacy is very important to WebMD and our policies are designed to fully protect the personal health information of our users,"" Ms. Fisher said. The Illinois inquiry comes after the publication a few days ago of a research letter in a medical journal reporting that some popular health portals leaked information about users' health searches to third parties, like social networks or ad networks, operating on their Web sites. For his research, Marco D. Huesch, a health care policy researcher at the Sol Price School of Public Policy at University of Southern California searched for content related to depression, herpes and cancer on 20 popular health-related Web sites. In the letter about his study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, he said that 13 of those sites used third-party tracking elements like cookies or social media plug-ins. Seven of the sites, he wrote, leaked his health searches to third-party trackers. Although Mr. Huesch wrote that he could not determine whether the third parties misused the information, he found the leakage of the health searches worrisome in itself. ""The ramifications could span embarrassment, discrimination in the labor market,"" Mr. Huesch wrote, ""or the deliberate decision by marketers not to offer or advertise particular goods and services to an individual, based solely on the companies' privately gathered knowledge."" The online advertising industry is keenly aware of such concerns. This year, the Network Advertising Initiative, an industry self-regulatory association for third-party digital ad companies, revised its code of conduct to require that its members obtain user permission before collecting information about certain specific health conditions. The conditions that would require user permission include ""all types of cancer, mental health related conditions, and sexually transmitted diseases,"" the revised code said, but not acne, high blood pressure, heartburn, cold and flu, or cholesterol management. The self-regulatory group has nearly 100 members, according to its site. The updated version of code of conduct is scheduled to take effect next year.  "
Daily Report: F.T.C. Raises Questions About Facebook's New Privacy Policy,"Facebook, which has repeatedly tripped over its own feet when changing its privacy practices, has stumbled yet again, Vindu Goel and Edward Wyatt report.  The Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday that it had begun an inquiry into whether the social network's proposed new privacy policies, unveiled two weeks ago, violated a 2011 agreement with regulators. Under that agreement, Facebook is required to get the explicit consent of its users before exposing their private information to new audiences. Facebook's new policies make clear that users are required to grant the company wide permission to use their personal information in advertising as a condition of using the service. Facebook says the language was in part required by a federal court. In August, a judge approved some of the wording as part of a settlement in a class-action suit brought by users upset at seeing their names and photos used to endorse products in Facebook ads sent to their friends.   "
Senator Intensifies Probe of Data Brokers,"A Congressional probe into the multibillion-dollar data brokerage industry - companies that collect, analyze, sell or share personal details about consumers for marketing purposes - is intensifying. On Wednesday afternoon, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, a West Virginia Democrat, sent a letter to Donald Robert, the chief executive of Experian, asking for information about a company subsidiary, called Court Ventures, that sold sensitive consumer data, allegedly to an identity theft service in Vietnam. Senator Rockefeller is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which last year beganinvestigating the practices of nine leading data brokers including Experian, a credit bureau that also offers marketing and fraud prevention services.  ""The committee's investigation has focused to date on how companies including Experian collect and sell consumer information for marketing purposes, while the information Experian reportedly sold to identity thieves - such as Social Security numbers and banking information - appears to be data Experian collects and sells for risk assessment activities,"" Mr. Rockefeller wrote in the letter to Mr. Robert. ""However, if these recent news accounts are accurate, they raise serious questions about whether Experian as a company has appropriate practices in place for vetting its customers and sharing sensitive consumer data with them, regardless of the particular line of business."" Mr. Rockefeller's letter is part of a larger effort by the Commerce Committee to understand how companies collect, share and sell intimate details about the shopping habits, health concerns, family circumstances and financial status of consumers at a time when Americans are increasingly sharing personal information online. The letter cited an article by KrebsOnSecurity.com, an Internet security news site, which published a report Sunday on the alleged sale of sensitive data by Court Ventures to the Web site Superget.info, whose administrators were based in Vietnam.  The report said that Court Ventures had signed a data-sharing agreement with another information services firm, called U.S. Info Search, and that Court Ventures had resold the other company's data to Superget.info. Last week, the Department of Justice announced an indictment against one of the administrators of the Superget.info site, a Vietnamese national named Hieu Minh Ngo. Among other allegations, the indictment charges him with conspiracy to commit identity fraud and aggravated identity theft. Experian bought Court Ventures, described on Experian.com as an aggregator that repackages and resells electronically available public records data ""obtained from more than 1,400 state and county sources,"" in 2012. In a statement, Gerry Tschopp, a spokesman for Experian, said: ""After the acquisition, the U.S. Secret Service notified Experian that Court Ventures had been and was reselling data from U.S. Info Search to a third party that the U.S. Secret Service was investigating as possibly engaged in illegal activity. Following the notice by the U.S. Secret Service, Experian discontinued reselling U.S. Info Search data and worked closely and in full cooperation with law enforcement to bring Vietnamese national Hieu Minh Ngo, the alleged perpetrator, to justice."" He added that ""no Experian database was accessed"" and that the suspect in the case had obtained access to the data before Experian acquired the company. Experian, which reported revenue of $4.73 billion in its 2013 fiscal year, had already come under scrutiny by Mr. Rockefeller before the news reports this week. Last year,the senator asked data brokers including Experian, Equifax, TransUnion and Reed Elsevier, which owns the Lexis-Nexis database, to provide a list of all sources from which the companies obtained information on consumers; a list of the types of details the companies collected about consumers; and a list of the services and data they offer to third parties.  One data broker, for instance, estimated that more than 250,000 Web sites apprise consumers that they share data with third parties. But, according to Mr. Rockefeller's letter to Mr. Robert, Experian to date has ""refused to fully respond"" to the Commerce Committee's request for the identities of Experian's sources of consumer data and the purchasers of that data. Mr. Tschopp, the Experian spokesman, said: ""We have responded - and will continue to respond - in a very transparent manner to Senator Rockefeller."" Last month, Mr. Rockefeller widened his probe, asking a dozen popular Web sites to provide information on their information-sharing practices with data brokers. The sites included About.com, Babycenter.com, Bankrate.com, Health.com, Investopedia.com, Mensfitness.com and Self.com. ""While some consumers may not object to having their information categorized and used for marketing,"" Mr. Rockefeller wrote to executives at the sites, ""before they share personal information, it is important that they know it may be used for purposes beyond those for which they originally provided it."" An earlier version of this article misstated at one point the name of a data broker. It is Experian, not Expedia.  "
Apple Releases Report on Government Requests,"Apple on Tuesday released a report showing the number of requests about its customers that it has received from government agencies around the globe. The report covers the first six months of 2013, ending on June 30, and says that government groups in 43 countries demanded information about roughly 40,000 Apple accounts or devices.  The company did not honor all the inquiries. Apple said it had complied to some extent with 88 percent of the requests it received by American agencies about its customers' devices. It did not disclose the extent to which it complied with requests from agencies in the United States about Apple accounts.  ""We believe that our customers have a right to understand how their personal information is handled, and we consider it our responsibility to provide them with the best privacy protections available,"" the company said in a statement. The most common account requests involved crimes, like robberies, as well as missing person cases, Apple said. Responding to an account request usually involves providing a name and an address.  ""Our business does not depend on collecting personal data,"" the company said in a statement. ""We have no interest in amassing personal information about our customers."" Apple said that it protected personal conversations by providing end-to-end encryption over iMessage and FaceTime, and that it did not store location data, Maps searches or Siri requests in any identifiable form. As a result, it said the vast majority of the requests it received were regarding devices.  ""These types of requests frequently arise when our customers ask the police to assist them with a lost or stolen iPhone, or when law enforcement has recovered a shipment of stolen devices,"" the company said.  The report comes amid continued criticism of the National Security Agency's surveillance practices, including the agency's ability to foil basic encryption and privacy safeguards online.  Google has spent months and millions of dollars encrypting emails its users send. Twitter plans to set up new types of encryption to protect the messages sent across its network. And several major technology companies, including Microsoft and Facebook, have released similar reports on government requests. But reports like those have remained largely symbolic gestures, especially because the companies often cannot disclose or enumerate the requests they receive from agencies regarding matters of national security.  In addition to the report on government requests, Apple said Tuesday that it had filed an amicus brief at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in support of a group of cases requesting greater transparency. ""Despite our extensive efforts in this area, we do not yet have an agreement that we feel adequately addresses our customers' right to know how often and under what circumstances we provide data to law enforcement agencies,"" Apple said. The company said that later this year it would file a brief in a federal appeals court in support of a case seeking greater transparency with the secret government requests known as national security letters.   "
Q&A: Protecting Your Mail Account," Q.  How can I keep my e-mail account from getting hacked?  A.  E-mail security is an ongoing issue, but there are basic precautions you can take to help keep your account safer from intruders, viruses and other malicious scenarios. To start, make sure your computer's operating system, security software and e-mail/Web browser program have all the latest updates and security patches installed.  Skipping simple or easy-to-remember passwords in favor of more complex creations made up of letters, numbers and symbols can help thwart those trying to guess your password. Microsoft's site has a guide to creating strong passwords and a program that evaluates password strength. If your e-mail provider offers it, take advantage of ""two-step authentication,"" which adds an extra layer of security to your e-mail account, usually by requiring you to enter a code sent to your mobile phone whenever you sign into the account on a different computer. The major mail providers all offer such verification services, including Google's Gmail, Yahoo Mail and Microsoft's Outlook.com. Time-honored safety practices, like ignoring messages asking for personal information and not clicking links in messages (unless you know the sender and the link is obviously to an entertainment or news site) are also advised. You should also avoid entering your e-mail name and password on public computers or networks. If someone does get control of your account and you need to verify your identity with your e-mail provider, be prepared to supply plenty of information. In addition to correctly answering the security questions you may have set up when you created the account, you might have to list things like the subjects of recent messages, the e-mail addresses of regular correspondents and other details that only you personally would know.  "
"Data Security Is a Classroom Worry, Too","LIKE many privacy-minded parents of elementary students, Tony Porterfield tries to keep close tabs on the personal information collected about his two sons. So when he heard that their school district in Los Altos, Calif., had adopted Edmodo, an online learning network connecting more than 20 million teachers and students around the world, he decided to check out the program. Edmodo's free software allows teachers to set up virtual classrooms where they can post homework assignments, give quizzes and use third-party apps to complement lessons. Students can create individual profiles, including their photograph and other details, within their teacher's class and post comments to a communal class feed. Mr. Porterfield, an engineer at Cisco Systems, examined Edmodo's data security practices by registering himself on the site as a fictional home-school teacher. As he went about creating imaginary students -- complete with cartoon avatars -- for his fictitious class, however, he noticed that Edmodo did not encrypt user sessions using a standard encryption protocol called Secure Sockets Layer.  That cryptography system, called SSL for short and used by many online banking and e-commerce sites, protects people who log in to sites over an open Wi-Fi network -- like the kind offered by many coffee shops -- from strangers who might be using snooping software on the same network. (An ''https'' at the beginning of a URL indicates SSL encryption.) Without that encryption, Mr. Porterfield says, he worried about the potential for a stranger to gain access to student information, and thus hypothetically be able to identify or even contact students. To test this hypothesis, he used a computer on his home Wi-Fi network to log in as an imaginary student; then, using another computer, he installed free security auditing software, called Cookie Cadger, to spy on the student's online activities. Though the risk of this happening with actual students seemed small -- Edmodo and other companies say they have no evidence that this kind of breach has occurred -- he contacted his school district about his concerns. ''There's a lot of contextual information you could use to gain trust, to make yourself seem familiar to the child,'' he says. ''As a parent, that's the scariest thing.'' In response to an inquiry from me last week, Sara Mandel, a spokeswoman for Edmodo, said the service provided ''a safe alternative to open, consumer social networking sites'' in that students could participate only in groups created by their teachers and because students cannot send private messages on the system. She added that ''any school that chooses'' had been able to use a completely encrypted version of the site since 2011 and that the company ''is working to ensure that all of our users are using an SSL-encrypted version.'' SCHOOL administrators and teachers said they liked these online learning systems because they could control the information that students might share. ''Kids can't talk to each other. They can only speak to the group,'' says Heather Peretz, a special-education teacher at Great Neck South Middle School in Great Neck, N.Y., who uses Edmodo in her English class. ''It helps them learn to be good digital citizens so they are not making inappropriate posts.'' But as school districts rush to adopt learning-management systems, some privacy advocates warn that educators may be embracing the bells and whistles before mastering fundamentals like data security and privacy. Although a federal law protecting children's online privacy requires online services to take reasonable measures to secure personal information -- like names and e-mail addresses -- collected from children under 13, the law doesn't specifically require SSL encryption. Yet school districts often issue only general notices about classroom technology, leaving many parents unaware of the practices of the online learning systems their children use. Moreover, schools often require online participation so students can gain access to course assignments or collaborate on projects. ''What we are finding with this type of database is that parents are uninformed,'' says Khaliah Barnes, a lawyer at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''Most don't understand how the technology works.'' Online security experts have long warned consumers about unencrypted Web sites that collect personal details. That is because on open Wi-Fi networks, hackers using simple software programs can see and copy the unique code, called a session cookie, that servers issue to authenticate a person who has logged into a Web site. By replicating that cookie, a hacker can acquire the same privileges, like the ability to edit a profile or grade a quiz, of the authenticated user for that session. To call attention to this risk, a software developer in 2010 released a free program called FireSheep that was capable of hijacking unencrypted sessions of people using open Wi-Fi. Early the next year, Facebook began rolling out full encryption. But, because that kind of cryptography requires more computing power, it can slow down sites and increase costs. That is why many sites -- even some dating services that ask personal questions -- remain largely unencrypted. ''It's not good to trade performance for security when you are talking about people's personal information,'' says Michael Clarkson, an assistant professor of computer science at George Washington University who teaches an annual course on software security. ''I can't think of a good reason not to keep the entire session encrypted.'' Last fall, Mr. Porterfield, who was coaching his younger son's soccer team, was asked by the league to use a free youth sports site provided by Shutterfly, a photo-sharing service, to post team rosters, player contact information, game locations and player photos. He discovered that the site was not fully encrypted -- an issue reported in a May article in Mother Jones. (Last Friday, a spokeswoman for Shutterfly told me that the company planned to introduce full SSL encryption on its youth sports and other sites by the end of July.) It was this that made Mr. Porterfield curious about data security practices of K-12 online learning services and led him to set up imaginary classes on several sites. One site was Schoology, a learning network used by more than two million students and teachers worldwide. Its privacy policy says it ''uses industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption to transfer private, personal information.'' Mr. Porterfield found that for the fictitious classroom he set up in May using Schoology's free software, the login page did use SSL. But the profile pages that included students' e-mail addresses, birth dates, phone numbers and home addresses were not protected. To check Mr. Porterfield's concerns, I asked Ashkan Soltani, an independent security analyst, to look at both Edmodo and Schoology. He found that each site's login page was encrypted, but not student sessions themselves. ''Anyone at a local cafe with Wi-Fi will have access to the information that the student is viewing or transmitting,'' he told me. ''I would consider that potentially sensitive information from the perspective of parents.'' Full-session encryption may not have seemed so important several years ago, when students logged into the sites primarily on secure networks at school or at home. But now that so many students use mobile devices, learning networks say they are moving toward full encryption. For individual teachers who wanted to set up online groups, for instance, Schoology until last week offered free software that encrypted login pages. For customers like school districts who paid for more comprehensive packages, the site offered the option of full-session encryption. Last Monday, Jeremy Friedman, the C.E.O. of Schoology, told me the company planned to switch to sitewide encryption by this fall. Last Thursday evening, he e-mailed with an update: the sitewide encryption had just been completed. ''Ultimately, we are all working toward the same thing -- protecting student data and privacy,'' Mr. Friedman said. SCHOOLS are also developing methods to protect student data. The Palo Alto Unified School District in California uses Schoology as a clearinghouse for course assignments in its secondary schools and a couple of elementary schools. But administrators prevent students from entering personal data, like e-mail addresses, in their profiles. They encourage students to upload an avatar, not a photo of themselves. And the district doesn't post grades on the site. ''We take security very seriously,'' says Ann Dunkin, the school district's chief technology officer, ''and one way to take it seriously is to limit the amount of information students can put into the system.'' But Mr. Porterfield says schools, no matter their vigilance, should be transparent with parents about the potential risks of online learning networks. ''It's not the school's decision to make,'' he said. ''You should let the parents know.'' "
"Cyberattacks a Huge Threat to Start-Ups, and Their Investors"," Craig A. Newman and Daniel L. Stein are litigation partners with Richards Kibbe & Orbe, the New York-based law firm.  Mr. Newman also serves as chief executive of the Freedom2Connect Foundation, a nonprofit group focused on promoting Internet freedom through the use of technology.  Mr. Stein is a former federal prosecutor. Recent news coverage of cybercrime reads like a modern spy novel, centered on antiestablishment hackers, sophisticated foreign espionage and threats of retaliation.  While the intrigue continues, the endless news of cyberattacks has been greeted with not much more than a shrug by investors.  Underlying this is a little-known area of online theft aimed at stealing intellectual property. Prominent attacks of major banks, news organizations and technology giants garner headlines, but it's the tech-driven start-ups and growth companies that are often far more vulnerable to an attack.   Hackers are aiming at these young, innovative companies with the goal of walking away with an entire business.  Consider the innovative American companies that have revolutionized the way we live and work, like Google and Instagram.  They were all built on a foundation of intellectual property rights: little more than a few great ideas, a unique business model and some computer code - all accessible with a few clicks of the mouse.   For start-ups, cybercrime is not an expensive annoyance, or part of geo-political gamesmanship, but a potentially devastating blow to their brand and their competitive position.  A digital intrusion carries the risk that critically valuable intellectual property is compromised, leading to their next big idea showing up not on Wall Street, but on the streets of Shanghai.  In fact, a recent study by Kaspersky Lab, a technology security firm, revealed that a Chinese hacking ring infiltrated the servers of dozens of video gaming companies. One of them was Trion Worlds, a privately held company in the United States that develops and publishes video games and gaming platforms including Defiance, the game tied in to a new sci-fi television series.  Trion hasn't commented on the attack.  The hackers reportedly stole valuable source code from the game developers and publishers, probably to sell pirated versions of its video games. In the fast-moving, cash-devouring world of start-ups, investors can't simply assume the executives running these private companies are spending on digital security.  The venture capitalists, angel investors and others who invest in start-ups are certainly a savvy group and rightly focused on business plans and cash flow.  But the truth is that some are behind the curve in demanding protections against cyber risks, and unwittingly adding significant risk to their own investments.  Public company investors have some protection, through government-required disclosures.  In October 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidelines reminding public companies to disclose to shareholders the costs and risks of cybercrime.   There have been only a handful of these disclosures so far, but the obligation to report cybercrime is clear.  As public companies come to understand the material nature of cyber threats, public disclosures should begin to shed more light on how they are addressing the risk.   But the more alarming fact is that private companies - many of which are the incubators for the newest technology and intellectual property - are under no securities law obligation to report cyberattacks to their investors.  And it's these private companies that are often struggling and unable to spend more than the bare minimum to safeguard their intellectual property and to protect their critical infrastructure - making them the perfect target for hackers. A cyber protection plan in place isn't just good governance, it's also good business.  A 2012study on the cost of cybercrime found that companies using good security governance practices saved more than $1 million a year, while those employing a high-level security leader saved an average of $1.8 million.  What's clear is that cybercrime is a new dimension of risk that private equity and venture investors are only beginning to grasp.  Professional investors - many of whom owe fiduciary duties to their own investors - have been too slow to recognize the threat.   It's time for them to start asking tough questions about cyber protection and governance. Just some of the questions they should be asking include: Do management and the board have a well-considered cyber protection plan in place?  Are the right personnel involved?  Is there a sufficient budget for doing so?  Does the company have cyber insurance?  And, perhaps most important, what happens when the inevitable security breach occurs?   The excitement around a young, innovative company can create a false sense of security, tempting investors to assume that the risk of a cyberattack is under control.  In fact, the assumption should be just the opposite.  The hotter and more buzz-worthy a company becomes, the bigger the target on its back.   Given that a company's entire worth can be walked out the virtual door in a matter of minutes, it's hard to imagine a more critical issue for investors to tackle.  "
Security Pioneer Creates Service to Encrypt Phone Calls and Text Messages,"SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO-- Attention, Snapchat: You have some very serious competition. Phil Zimmermann, the creator of Pretty Good Privacy, is widely considered the godfather of encryption software. After making his software available for download in the 1990s, he was the subject of a criminal investigation that was eventually dropped in 1996. Today, his P.G.P. software is the most widely used e-mail encryption software in the world. But these days, Mr. Zimmermann is busy with his new venture, Silent Circle, which provides encryption for smartphone users. At a security conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Mr. Zimmermann introduced the service, which is available for Android and iPhone. Silent Circle lets users make encrypted phone calls, send text messages and do  videoconferencing. Messages are scrubbed completely from the phone after a predetermined amount of time. Communications are secured using a new, peer-reviewed open-source encryption technology  Mr. Zimmermann's business partners include Jon Callas, who co-founded the PGP  Corporation, which now belongs to Symantec, and two former Navy SEALs, Mike Janke and Vic Hyder. His target market, Mr. Zimmermann said, is soldiers based overseas, business people who operate in known surveillance states, human rights activists, dissidents and (more recently) journalists. Since starting Silent Circle in October, Mr. Zimmermann, said, he has spent nearly all his time in Washington signing up government agencies and contractors. He was adamant that the service be subscription-based. Individual users pay $20 a month, while businesses are charged per employee. He said he was often asked why people would pay to use the service when they could just as easily make free calls with Skype. ""I tell them go ahead and use Skype - I don't even want to talk to you. This is for serious people interested in serious cryptography,"" he said. ""We are not Facebook. We are the opposite of Facebook."" Silent Circle's interface looks a lot like the native iOS and Android dialing and text messaging features, and the videoconference service closely resembles Skype. Users are given 10-digit ""silent numbers"" that work with other Silent Circle subscribers. For an additional $29 a month, the numbers can be used to dial outside Silent Circle. In those cases, the service encrypts phone calls between its users and its servers in Canada, so anyone looking to track users wouldn't be able to trace them beyond Canada. The company had its reasons for locating its servers in Canada, where they fall outside United States government control. Canada also has much stricter privacy laws than the United States or even the European Union. Mr. Zimmermann noted that law enforcement would not be able to eavesdrop on Silent Circle users and, for that matter, neither would Silent Circle. ""When we say we don't have the keys, we mean that,"" Mr. Zimmermann said, referring to the electronic key that would be necessary to decrypt a message. Mr. Zimmermann invented his own peer-to-peer encryption protocol to avoid the risk that Silent Circle's communications could be intercepted by someone faking a certificate from  one of the authorities that guarantee communications are secure. In 2011, DigiNotar, a Dutch company that sells security certificates, was compromised by what many believe to have been Iran or hackers working on its behalf. ""There are thousands of Iranian dissidents in prison today because of that failure,"" Mr. Zimmermann said. In an analysis of the DigiNotar attack, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found the certificate authority system to be insecure. ""Until we have augmented or replaced the certificate authority system with something more secure,"" the foundation said, ""all of our fixes to the problem of HTTPS/TLS/SSL insecurity will be Band-Aids."" There are now a number of apps that promise to secure communications. Wickr, a mobile app, performs a similar service that encrypts video, photos and text messages. Security researchers, however, complain that not enough is known about the app's protocols. Anticipating that criticism, Silent Circle has published its source code for review to prove that its encryption is secure and that there are no back doors. ""I've spent my whole career on the principle of no back doors,"" Mr. Zimmermann said. ""So we're not about to start."" While they are not exactly Silent Circle's target market, teenagers are increasingly using Snapchat, a popular mobile app that allows them to take and send pictures and control how long messages are visible on the recipient's phone. Facebook recently unveiled a service called Poke that competes with Snapchat. Those services make no encryption promises, and researchers have pointed out that a security flaw makes it easy for recipients to save messages without senders knowing about it. It is also unclear whether data sent through the services is wiped completely, which would make it impossible for forensics investigators or law enforcement officials to reconstruct messages. Asked whether Mr. Zimmermann considered Snapchat a competitor, he chuckled. ""I've never heard of it.""  "
Chinese Defense Ministry Accuses U.S. of Hypocrisy on Spying,"HONG KONG -- The Chinese Ministry of National Defense accused the United States on Thursday of hypocrisy over cybersurveillance and said the disclosures made by Edward J. Snowden bolstered the case for China's security efforts on the Internet. These were the harshest public comments so far from the Chinese government about Mr. Snowden's revelations. Until now, the Chinese government's comments on the disclosures have come through the Foreign Ministry, which has used relatively muted words to answer reporters' questions about Mr. Snowden's allegations. Mr. Snowden, a former C.I.A. employee, has described the United States' monitoring of Chinese Internet sites and installations, and Prism, a National Security Agency program to mine Internet information.  In recent days, Chinese state-run news media have amplified criticisms of the United States, and the remarks from the Defense Ministry spokesman, Col. Yang Yujun, struck a tougher tone. He did not refer explicitly to the United States, but he left no doubt about his target. ''The Prism-gate affair is itself just like a prism that reveals the true face and hypocritical conduct regarding Internet security of the country concerned,'' Colonel Yang said at a monthly news conference in Beijing. The comments from the briefing, which was open only to Chinese reporters, were reported on the Web site of the Defense Ministry. ''The Prism-gate affair again reminds us that we must attach even more importance to Internet and information security protection, and resolutely protect Internet security and national security,'' Colonel Yang said. His casting of China as the unblemished victim of Internet intrusions is unlikely to persuade the United States government. Washington has laid out evidence that it says points to heavy involvement of the People's Liberation Army in computer hacking and espionage. But the latest official remarks, together with a surge of commentary in state-run Chinese newspapers and television news, appear aimed at persuading Chinese citizens that their government holds the moral high ground in Internet issues. China heavily censors and monitors the Internet. ''To, on the one hand, abuse one's advantages in information technology for selfish ends, while on the other hand, making baseless accusations against other countries, shows double standards that will be of no help for peace and security in cyberspace,'' Colonel Yang said. Before he took flight to Moscow, Mr. Snowden hid in Hong Kong, a Chinese city and former British colony that has legal autonomy from the mainland. He considered seeking long-term sanctuary in Hong Kong, but the Chinese government was relieved when he left, analysts said. China's president, Xi Jinping, met President Obama in California this month, and Mr. Xi has repeatedly said he wants stable relations with the United States. The Chinese Communist Party has wobbled between that goal and its desire to maximize domestic advantage from Mr. Snowden's revelations, said Yang Hengjun, a former Chinese official and researcher who now divides his time among Hong Kong, mainland China and Australia. Mr. Snowden's departure from Hong Kong made it easier for China to speak more strongly on the issue, he said. ''Xi Jinping and, in step with him, the Foreign Ministry want to preserve the stability of Chinese-American relations,'' Mr. Yang said in a telephone interview from Sydney. ''They don't want this affair to destroy their efforts. But the propaganda has had a countereffect. The pressure from public opinion was to keep Snowden and even have Beijing take him in.'' "
"Worry About Cyberattacks Increases, Survey Says","The National Small Business Association recently released its 2013 Small Business Technology Survey, a study of small-business owners selected by the association. Among the findings were that 94 percent of small-business owners were worried about cybersecurity and nearly half reported their businesses were victims of cyberattacks.  The top three information technology concerns facing small businesses are the cost of upgrades, security issues and the time it takes to fix problems. According to the association, cyberattacks cost small businesses an average of $8,699 for each attack; businesses whose banking accounts were hacked had an average loss of $6,927. Small-business owners have good reason to be concerned. According to the Symantec Internet Security Threat Report released in April, attackers use small businesses as pawns for more sophisticated attacks and to hit bigger organizations. The largest growth area for cyberattacks in 2012 was businesses with fewer than 250 employees. In fact, 31 percent of all attacks singled out that group, a threefold increase in number from 2011.   The top economic sector for attacks has shifted from government to manufacturing, the report said. Another finding was that the employees most singled out for attack in 2012 - 27 percent - were knowledge workers like engineers, scientists, lawyers and communications specialists. These people create the intellectual property that attackers want. Those in sales, who manage customer data, were the target of 24 percent of attacks. The National Small Business Association study found that the use of cloud computing, smartphones and tablets had increased significantly over the last three years, since the last time the association conducted a survey. Social media play a larger role in a small business's online strategy now - in fact, only 27 percent of small businesses do not use social media. Small-business owners are handling more of their own technology needs, rather than paying an outside firm or consultant to do it. And a growing reliance on mobile technology tools has driven an increase in the percentage of small businesses that allow their employees to telecommute - to 60 percent today from 44 percent in 2010. Siamak Farah, the chief executive of Infostreet, a cloud applications provider based in Tarzana, Calif., says the shift to the cloud has been ""a great democratizer"" for small businesses. His company's flagship product is SkyDesktop. Once users log in, they can connect to all their cloud applications, like accounting programs, customer-relationship management software or document management apps. ""In the old days you needed a server, a person to manage the server, and then two or three years later, you needed to upgrade the server,"" Mr. Farah said. ""But now because of the cloud, you don't have to make that investment or lose the productivity. And that's been a huge savings for small businesses.""  You can follow Eilene Zimmerman on Twitter.

Report Says Harvard Officials Didn't Think E-Mail Search Violated Privacy Rules,"A review commissioned by Harvard University and released on Monday concluded that administrators who searched some faculty members' e-mail accounts last year did so in good faith, and it found no evidence that they had actually read any e-mails.  The administrators ''who authorized, supervised and conducted these searches believed that they were acting in compliance with applicable e-mail privacy policies,'' said a report of the inquiry, conducted by Michael B. Keating, a Boston lawyer with the firm Foley Hoag. But the 29-page report cited ''inadequate university policies governing the privacy of e-mail communications,'' which were overlapping and sometimes contradictory. In a statement, Harvard's president, Drew Gilpin Faust, said, ''The findings strengthen my view that we need much clearer, better and more widely understood policies'' on privacy. Dr. Faust has commissioned a task force to recommend such policies. ''In the meantime,'' she said, ''I will be announcing before the start of the fall semester interim protocols governing any searches of e-mails at the university.'' Some faculty members who have been critical of the administration's actions said they would withhold judgment until new policies were created. The e-mail searches stemmed from a cheating scandal at Harvard in which well over 100 students were suspected of improperly collaborating on a take-home final exam in a government class in May 2012. Last fall, about 70 were forced to take a leave of absence. Soon after the university made the affair public in August, elements of the Administrative Board's handling of the cases -- which was supposed to be confidential -- began to appear in The Harvard Crimson. In September, administrators investigated the source of the leaks, focusing on the resident deans, young faculty members who usually live in the student dormitories, known as houses. Each resident dean has a Harvard e-mail account attached to that position, and a separate, personal Harvard e-mail account. The administrators ordered a search of the 17 resident deans' official accounts to see if they had forwarded an e-mail about the cheating investigation to students. After finding that one resident dean had sent the e-mail to two students who were accused, the administrators then searched that resident dean's personal account as well, looking for signs of communication with journalists. The resident dean was questioned but not punished. The other resident deans did not learn that their e-mail accounts had been searched until March, when The Boston Globe began inquiring about the matter, prompting angry reactions from professors who cited not only an expectation of privacy, but a policy in which Harvard had to give a faculty member prior warning of such a search. Mr. Keating's report said the officials who had approved the searches did not appear to be aware of that policy, but went by a separate policy that did not have that requirement. "
Tips on Avoiding Phishing Frauds,"I consider myself fairly cautious about Internet security, but I was still nearly caught off guard by a phishing effort aimed at me a couple of years ago. I had gone online, as I routinely do, to check my bank account balance, and make sure nothing looked amiss. I logged out and returned to my work. A few minutes later, I received an e-mail - apparently, from my bank.  The message had my bank's logo, and said the bank was following up on a possible problem with a transaction. Could I please reply, it asked, with some additional information? Normally, I would immediately delete such an e-mail - but I had been online with my bank just minutes before. Could it be a coincidence? I hesitated, and decided to contact my bank directly to check. It turned out that the e-mail wasn't from my bank, but most likely from some sort of fraudulent outfit trying to get information to obtain access to my account. Such ploys are known as ""phishing,"" in which fraud artists pose as legitimate companies to try to get you to reveal important personal information, like account numbers, passwords or even your Social Security number. Such information can be used to get into your accounts, or create fake identities to apply for credit in your name. Since I got the suspicious e-mail, phishing attempts have become more sophisticated, according to the Consumer Federation of America. The fraud artists are now better at aiming their efforts. Instead of sending e-mails randomly, they may look for an employee's e-mail address on a company Web site and send messages that appear to be from the employer. The federation, with backing from Visa, has put together an updated tip sheet on how to avoid phishing scams. Tips include these: - If you are contacted by someone asking for personal or account information, think about why they would need it. If it's an organization you already doing business with, they should already have such information. - Be wary of clicking on links or attachments in unsolicited e-mails. The links could take you to a rogue Web site, in an effort to have you enter personal information. - Watch out for phishing by phone, in which callers ask you for personal information for illegitimate purposes. Visa also offers advice about identifying fraudulent e-mails on its ""Fraud News"" site. For examples of phishing e-mails, you can go to Cornell University's ""Phish Bowl"" Web site. Have you ever received an e-mail that seemed to be a phishing effort? What happened?  "
"Disruptions: New Motto for Silicon Valley: First Security, Then Innovation","At Facebook's headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., are stark white posters with bright red statements like ""Done is better than perfect"" and ""Move fast and break things."" These disruptive philosophies embody the spirit not just of Facebook but of Silicon Valley. Yet today, when technology companies have become the prime targets of rogue governments and hackers, the ideologies that drive these companies to provoke could end up disrupting these companies. Conversely, the signs sitting in security research firms across the country warn, ""Carelessness causes security incidents.""  Although technology companies say they take security seriously, protecting their customers seems to come second to announcing new products. Take Twitter, where people's accounts are frequently hacked. In the last few months alone, this has happened to Burger King, BBC, NPR, The Associated Press and a slew of celebrities and users. In that time, Twitter has proudly announced updates to features on its mobile and desktop apps, introduced a music Web site and redesigned its company blog. But it still hasn't released two-factor authentication, a security tool used by the rest of the industry to deter hackers. Although Twitter declined to comment, I'm sure most of the people on the site who have seen their accounts pilfered over the last several years would rather have two-factor authentication than a shiny new Twitter blog. One solution is a bill crawling through Congress over the last two years, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, known as Cispa. The bill would make it easy for tech companies to share information about computer security threats with government agencies, helping fortify against cyberattacks. But privacy groups say that Cispa is not a solution to the problem, and that instead it hands the highly sensitive personal data we want protected to the government. ""It has to be the obligation of these tech companies to build in security from the very beginning before we start moving into solutions about bringing the government into the private sector,"" said Leslie Harris, president and chief executive of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington-based advocacy group financed by a broad coalition of technology and telecommunication companies. ""You want to see these very innovative companies step up and become the leaders in security solutions first."" Cispa's creators and defenders see it differently. They argue that companies are not simply fortifying against a child in his bedroom who is trying to get into their servers for fun. Today's hackers hail from foreign governments like those in China, Syria and Estonia, and are adept at getting what they want. Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who was one of the authors of Cispa, recently said that ""our government, our industries and your personal information will be subjected to hundreds of thousands of attempts at hacking"" in a single day. ""We are in a stealthy cyber war in America. And we're losing."" He thinks the government can solve that problem. Kelsey Knight, director of communications for Mr. Rogers, said in a phone interview that Cispa could stop ""90 percent of the current security breaches"" that happen today. ""Then, in reverse, these companies would be able to share their threat of information and code back to the government and that will add to the list of zeros and ones that we can keep defending against together."" Ms. Knight noted that start-ups cannot defend themselves against today's advanced attacks because the cost can be hundreds of thousands of dollars. She said Cispa and other government groups can help. One thing is clear: today's tactics are not working. During the State of the Union address this year, President Obama cited the need to protect ""national security"" and ""privacy"" while defending against cyber attacks. The president has also been meeting with chief executives to discuss ways to combat the threat of computer warfare and corporate espionage. Cispa, now in the Senate, could take months, if not years, if it is to emerge at all from Congress. Until then, advocacy groups believe it falls to the start-ups to put more effort into security. ""The 'move fast and break things' philosophy is not a philosophy that has necessarily been good for our privacy,"" Ms. Harris said. ""I certainly believe that government and companies should be working together, but information sharing is just a very small part of the cyber security puzzle. It's companies investing the resources to strengthen their own security first."" Maybe it's time for companies in Silicon Valley to replace those posters with ones that say, ""Move slowly and protect your users.""  E-mail: bilton@nytimes.com   "
Cyberstalkers Threaten Pipeline Security,"In a recent  annual review, a team at the Department of Homeland Security that works to counter  the threat of  attacks  on critical computer infrastructure counted 198 incidents in fiscal 2012. The events reported ranged from the use of malware to sabotage systems to phishing attacks for retrieving  sensitive information. In roughly 40 percent of those cases, the target was the energy sector - ""an alarming rate,"" the report said. Last year the Obama administration championed passage of a  Cybersecurity Act, which would have helped companies that operate critical infrastructure to improve the security of their computer systems and share information about attacks on their networks with the federal government.  But Senate Republicans succeeded in fending off the bill last August, arguing that it would have imposed a financial burden on companies.  In November, a White House draft executive order  picked up the baton by calling for concerted agency action on the issue. The order describes the attacks on critical infrastructure, which have risen exponentially over the last five years, as ""one of the most serious national security challenges we must confront."" Last year, for example, the natural gas industry fought off a lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful series of attacks on its pipeline infrastructure, with the Department of Homeland Security issuing three amber alerts, the second-highest level of warning.The Transportation Security Administration wields authority over pipeline security but has yet to promulgate industry-wide standards for computer security, relying instead on the voluntary adoption of best practices. Pipeline vulnerability is a particular concern because of the ubiquity of supervisory control and data acquisition, or Scada, software systems, which are used to monitor variables like pressure and flow rates. Pipeline operators can respond to any unexpected changes through remote management of valves, pumps and compressor stations. But, like any software, Scada systems are susceptible to hacking and viruses. The Stuxnet computer worm, designed jointly by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility in 2008, is a prime example of how such attacks can disrupt and destroy physical infrastructure. In the case of pipelines, the attacks could come in the form of unauthorized commands or false reports to operators, resulting in spills, fires or explosions. Investigators have so far not linked any historical pipeline problems to malicious  activity, but software malfunctions have illustrated the potential threat. In the summer of 2010, problems in a Scada control center contributed to the spill of more than one million gallons of crude oil outside the small town of Marshall, Mich. Coursing through local waterways, the oil made its way into the Kalamazoo River and now ranks as one of the largest inland spills in the nation's history. Debate over  security regulation remains fiercely split along party lines, with Senate Republicans casting  40 of the 46 nay votes against last year's Cybersecurity Act. A recent letter from Congressional Republicans to the president attacked his draft order as a ""backdoor regulatory framework."" One of the central concerns of those who oppose cyber security standards is that the  threats morph  too quickly for notoriously slow bureaucrats to keep up with. In Canada, however, the National Energy Board published regulatory standards for pipelines in 2010 after a three-year rule-making process that drew heavily on industry expertise. The regulation was motivated by security assessments in 2004 and 2005 that exposed a  security vacuum  at companies across the country. ""Industry had input all through development of the standard,"" said Wes Elliott, technical leader for security at the National Energy Board. ""It proved a commonsense approach that has worked well for us."" All Canadian pipeline operators must now devise management plans to meet certain performance standards. Field visits by personnel from the National Energy Board are used to confirm that the management plans are put into action. Regardless of the prospects for federal computer security regulation,  pipeline managers in the United States face severe resource constraints: the equivalent of only 13 full-time employees in the Transportation Security Administration are responsible for overseeing nearly 1.5 million miles of pipeline. In a letter last year to Senate majority and minority leaders, security experts  including  former directors of the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security warned of  the imminent danger of a ""cyber 9/11."" ""It is not a question of 'whether' this will happen,"" they wrote. ""It is a question of 'when.' ""  "
A Hacker Says Smart Grid Can Be Penetrated,"A hacker wearing a fake beard and dark sunglasses took the stage at a computer security conference in Miami on Thursday and showed a group of about 60 security researchers how to intercept the radio communications between Silver Spring Networks, a maker of smart grid technology, and its clients, which include major utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric and Pepco Holdings.  The hacker, who goes by the moniker Atlas, stopped short of showing how to inflict damage to these systems, but the implication of his presentation was clear: If you can understand the way these systems speak to one another, the potential to hack them is very real. And, the logic continues, if you can hack these systems, then you could tinker with an oil or gas pipeline, or cause a power failure. ""I see these placed everywhere that I want them to be as a hacker,"" Atlas said of Silver Spring's wireless communications. ""I see the sales getting better. I see a Titanic running full speed towards an iceberg, with the potential for a rudder that might make the turn in time."" Silver Spring Networks, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., makes the hardware and software that utilities use to connect electric meters in a digital grid. Atlas said he zeroed in on the company because he questioned Silver Spring's security ""buzzwords."" On its Web site, Silver Spring says it ensures that ""only authorized personnel can access these devices,"" provides encryption and claims to protect its data with hashing, or scrambling, functions. Atlas said he was able to intercept Silver Spring's radio frequency communications, in part, by examining publicly available patents and user manuals. Silver Spring Networks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Although Atlas did not think an attack on the smart grid was imminent, he expressed concern that unless the systems were tested now, ""10 years down the road they will be a real problem.""  ""We are at a time in great need of vigilance,"" he added.  "
Hackers in China Attacked The Times for Last 4 Months,"SAN FRANCISCO -- For the last four months, Chinese hackers have persistently attacked The New York Times, infiltrating its computer systems and getting passwords for its reporters and other employees. After surreptitiously tracking the intruders to study their movements and help erect better defenses to block them, The Times and computer security experts have expelled the attackers and kept them from breaking back in. The timing of the attacks coincided with the reporting for a Times investigation, published online on Oct. 25, that found that the relatives of Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister, had accumulated a fortune worth several billion dollars through business dealings. Security experts hired by The Times to detect and block the computer attacks gathered digital evidence that Chinese hackers, using methods that some consultants have associated with the Chinese military in the past, breached The Times's network. They broke into the e-mail accounts of its Shanghai bureau chief, David Barboza, who wrote the reports on Mr. Wen's relatives, and Jim Yardley, The Times's South Asia bureau chief in India, who previously worked as bureau chief in Beijing.  ''Computer security experts found no evidence that sensitive e-mails or files from the reporting of our articles about the Wen family were accessed, downloaded or copied,'' said Jill Abramson, executive editor of The Times. The hackers tried to cloak the source of the attacks on The Times by first penetrating computers at United States universities and routing the attacks through them, said computer security experts at Mandiant, the company hired by The Times. This matches the subterfuge used in many other attacks that Mandiant has tracked to China. The attackers first installed malware -- malicious software -- that enabled them to gain entry to any computer on The Times's network. The malware was identified by computer security experts as a specific strain associated with computer attacks originating in China. More evidence of the source, experts said, is that the attacks started from the same university computers used by the Chinese military to attack United States military contractors in the past. Security experts found evidence that the hackers stole the corporate passwords for every Times employee and used those to gain access to the personal computers of 53 employees, most of them outside The Times's newsroom. Experts found no evidence that the intruders used the passwords to seek information that was not related to the reporting on the Wen family. No customer data was stolen from The Times, security experts said. Asked about evidence that indicated the hacking originated in China, and possibly with the military, China's Ministry of National Defense said, ''Chinese laws prohibit any action including hacking that damages Internet security.'' It added that ''to accuse the Chinese military of launching cyberattacks without solid proof is unprofessional and baseless.'' The attacks appear to be part of a broader computer espionage campaign against American news media companies that have reported on Chinese leaders and corporations. Last year, Bloomberg News was targeted by Chinese hackers, and some employees' computers were infected, according to a person with knowledge of the company's internal investigation, after Bloomberg published an article on June 29 about the wealth accumulated by relatives of Xi Jinping, China's vice president at the time. Mr. Xi became general secretary of the Communist Party in November and is expected to become president in March. Ty Trippet, a spokesman for Bloomberg, confirmed that hackers had made attempts but said that ''no computer systems or computers were compromised.'' Signs of a Campaign The mounting number of attacks that have been traced back to China suggest that hackers there are behind a far-reaching spying campaign aimed at an expanding set of targets including corporations, government agencies, activist groups and media organizations inside the United States. The intelligence-gathering campaign, foreign policy experts and computer security researchers say, is as much about trying to control China's public image, domestically and abroad, as it is about stealing trade secrets. Security experts said that beginning in 2008, Chinese hackers began targeting Western journalists as part of an effort to identify and intimidate their sources and contacts, and to anticipate stories that might damage the reputations of Chinese leaders. In a December intelligence report for clients, Mandiant said that over the course of several investigations it found evidence that Chinese hackers had stolen e-mails, contacts and files from more than 30 journalists and executives at Western news organizations, and had maintained a ''short list'' of journalists whose accounts they repeatedly attack. While computer security experts say China is most active and persistent, it is not alone in using computer attacks for a variety of national purposes, including corporate espionage. The United States, Israel, Russia and Iran, among others, are suspected of developing and deploying cyberweapons. The United States and Israel have never publicly acknowledged it, but evidence indicates they released a sophisticated computer worm starting around 2008 that attacked and later caused damage at Iran's main nuclear enrichment plant. Iran is believed to have responded with computer attacks on targets in the United States, including American banks and foreign oil companies. Russia is suspected of having used computer attacks during its war with Georgia in 2008. The following account of the attack on The Times -- which is based on interviews with Times executives, reporters and security experts -- provides a glimpse into one such spy campaign. After The Times learned of warnings from Chinese government officials that its investigation of the wealth of Mr. Wen's relatives would ''have consequences,'' executives on Oct. 24 asked AT&T, which monitors The Times's computer network, to watch for unusual activity. On Oct. 25, the day the article was published online, AT&T informed The Times that it had noticed behavior that was consistent with other attacks believed to have been perpetrated by the Chinese military. The Times notified and voluntarily briefed the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the attacks and then -- not initially recognizing the extent of the infiltration of its computers -- worked with AT&T to track the attackers even as it tried to eliminate them from its systems. But on Nov. 7, when it became clear that attackers were still inside its systems despite efforts to expel them, The Times hired Mandiant, which specializes in responding to security breaches. Since learning of the attacks, The Times -- first with AT&T and then with Mandiant -- has monitored attackers as they have moved around its systems. Hacker teams regularly began work, for the most part, at 8 a.m. Beijing time. Usually they continued for a standard work day, but sometimes the hacking persisted until midnight. Occasionally, the attacks stopped for two-week periods, Mandiant said, though the reason was not clear. Investigators still do not know how hackers initially broke into The Times's systems. They suspect the hackers used a so-called spear-phishing attack, in which they send e-mails to employees that contain malicious links or attachments. All it takes is one click on the e-mail by an employee for hackers to install ''remote access tools'' -- or RATs. Those tools can siphon off oceans of data -- passwords, keystrokes, screen images, documents and, in some cases, recordings from computers' microphones and Web cameras -- and send the information back to the attackers' Web servers. Michael Higgins, chief security officer at The Times, said: ''Attackers no longer go after our firewall. They go after individuals. They send a malicious piece of code to your e-mail account and you're opening it and letting them in.'' Lying in Wait Once hackers get in, it can be hard to get them out. In the case of a 2011 breach at the United States Chamber of Commerce, for instance, the trade group worked closely with the F.B.I. to seal its systems, according to chamber employees. But months later, the chamber discovered that Internet-connected devices -- a thermostat in one of its corporate apartments and a printer in its offices -- were still communicating with computers in China. In part to prevent that from happening, The Times allowed hackers to spin a digital web for four months to identify every digital back door the hackers used. It then replaced every compromised computer and set up new defenses in hopes of keeping hackers out. ''Attackers target companies for a reason -- even if you kick them out, they will try to get back in,'' said Nick Bennett, the security consultant who has managed Mandiant's investigation. ''We wanted to make sure we had full grasp of the extent of their access so that the next time they try to come in, we can respond quickly.'' Based on a forensic analysis going back months, it appears the hackers broke into The Times computers on Sept. 13, when the reporting for the Wen articles was nearing completion. They set up at least three back doors into users' machines that they used as a digital base camp. From there they snooped around The Times's systems for at least two weeks before they identified the domain controller that contains user names and hashed, or scrambled, passwords for every Times employee. While hashes make hackers' break-ins more difficult, hashed passwords can easily be cracked using so-called rainbow tables -- readily available databases of hash values for nearly every alphanumeric character combination, up to a certain length. Some hacker Web sites publish as many as 50 billion hash values. Investigators found evidence that the attackers cracked the passwords and used them to gain access to a number of computers. They created custom software that allowed them to search for and grab Mr. Barboza's and Mr. Yardley's e-mails and documents from a Times e-mail server. Over the course of three months, attackers installed 45 pieces of custom malware. The Times -- which uses antivirus products made by Symantec -- found only one instance in which Symantec identified an attacker's software as malicious and quarantined it, according to Mandiant. A Symantec spokesman said that, as a matter of policy, the company does not comment on its customers. The attackers were particularly active in the period after the Oct. 25 publication of The Times article about Mr. Wen's relatives, especially on the evening of the Nov. 6 presidential election. That raised concerns among Times senior editors who had been informed of the attacks that the hackers might try to shut down the newspaper's electronic or print publishing system. But the attackers' movements suggested that the primary target remained Mr. Barboza's e-mail correspondence. ''They could have wreaked havoc on our systems,'' said Marc Frons, the Times's chief information officer. ''But that was not what they were after.'' What they appeared to be looking for were the names of people who might have provided information to Mr. Barboza. Mr. Barboza's research on the stories, as reported previously in The Times, was based on public records, including thousands of corporate documents through China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Those documents -- which are available to lawyers and consulting firms for a nominal fee -- were used to trace the business interests of relatives of Mr. Wen. A Tricky Search Tracking the source of an attack to one group or country can be difficult because hackers usually try to cloak their identities and whereabouts. To run their Times spying campaign, the attackers used a number of compromised computer systems registered to universities in North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsin and New Mexico, as well as smaller companies and Internet service providers across the United States, according to Mandiant's investigators. The hackers also continually switched from one I.P. address to another; an I.P. address, for Internet protocol, is a unique number identifying each Internet-connected device from the billions around the globe, so that messages and other information sent by one device are correctly routed to the ones meant to get them. Using university computers as proxies and switching I.P. addresses were simply efforts to hide the source of the attacks, which investigators say is China. The pattern that Mandiant's experts detected closely matched the pattern of earlier attacks traced to China. After Google was attacked in 2010 and the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists were opened, for example, investigators were able to trace the source to two educational institutions in China, including one with ties to the Chinese military. Security experts say that by routing attacks through servers in other countries and outsourcing attacks to skilled hackers, the Chinese military maintains plausible deniability. ''If you look at each attack in isolation, you can't say, 'This is the Chinese military,' '' said Richard Bejtlich, Mandiant's chief security officer. But when the techniques and patterns of the hackers are similar, it is a sign that the hackers are the same or affiliated. ''When you see the same group steal data on Chinese dissidents and Tibetan activists, then attack an aerospace company, it starts to push you in the right direction,'' he said. Mandiant has been tracking about 20 groups that are spying on organizations inside the United States and around the globe. Its investigators said that based on the evidence -- the malware used, the command and control centers compromised and the hackers' techniques -- The Times was attacked by a group of Chinese hackers that Mandiant refers to internally as ''A.P.T. Number 12.'' A.P.T. stands for Advanced Persistent Threat, a term that computer security experts and government officials use to describe a targeted attack and that many say has become synonymous with attacks done by China. AT&T and the F.B.I. have been tracking the same group, which they have also traced to China, but they use their own internal designations. Mandiant said the group had been ''very active'' and had broken into hundreds of other Western organizations, including several American military contractors. To get rid of the hackers, The Times blocked the compromised outside computers, removed every back door into its network, changed every employee password and wrapped additional security around its systems. For now, that appears to have worked, but investigators and Times executives say they anticipate more efforts by hackers. ''This is not the end of the story,'' said Mr. Bejtlich of Mandiant. ''Once they take a liking to a victim, they tend to come back. It's not like a digital crime case where the intruders steal stuff and then they're gone. This requires an internal vigilance model.'' "
Germany Fines Google Over Street View Data Collection,"BERLIN -- A German privacy regulator fined Google &#x20ac;145,000 on Monday for the systematic, illegal collection of personal data while it was creating the Street View mapping service, and called on European lawmakers to significantly raise fines for violations of data protection laws. Johannes Caspar, the data protection supervisor in Hamburg, said the fine, which was close to the maximum of &#x20ac;150,000, or $195,000, that he could legally impose, was woefully inadequate to stop the collection practices of companies as large as Google.  The fine levied by Mr. Caspar, the largest assessed so far by European regulators over privacy concerns, amounts to roughly 0.002 percent of Google's $10.7 billion in net profit last year. ''As long as violations of data protection law are penalized with such insignificant sums, the ability of existing laws to protect personal privacy in the digital world, with its high potential for abuse, is barely possible,'' Mr. Caspar said. In 2010, Mr. Caspar's agency became the first to uncover Google's collection of data from Wi-Fi routers in Germany, and the company acknowledged that it had also collected data in a similar fashion for Street View around the world, prompting an uproar from Washington to Hong Kong. Google characterized the collection as inadvertent and the result of a programmer's error. Fragments of personal e-mails, photographs and other unencrypted digital data were collected by Google's fleet of Street View automobiles as they compiled panoramic maps covering about five million miles, or eight million kilometers, of roadway in 49 countries. Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, reiterated the company's regrets, and said it had taken internal steps to make sure the violations were not repeated. ''We work hard to get privacy right at Google,'' Mr. Fleischer said in a statement. ''But in this case we didn't, which is why we quickly tightened up our systems to address the issue.'' The Google project leaders had inadvertently collected the data, he said. ''We never wanted this data, and didn't use it or even look at it,'' Mr. Fleischer said, adding that the company had ''cooperated fully'' with Hamburg data protection officials on the investigation. Google said it would not appeal the fine. Anna Fielder, a trustee at Privacy International, a group based in London that supports strong data protection laws, said the existing legal regimes in Europe and much of the world were ill equipped to meet the challenges of protecting personal information. ''Germany has the strongest data protection laws in Europe, and this is all they could do,'' Ms. Fielder said. ''Most businesses are not complying with data protection laws because the costs of noncompliance -- I mean these tiny penalties -- are so low.'' Google's disclosure that it had collected the private information set off a series of investigations by regulators around the world, the majority of which were settled by Google with a simple apology or with fines that were considered trivial for the world's biggest Internet search company. In March, Google agreed to pay a fine of $7 million and to aggressively police its own employees on privacy issues to settle a lawsuit brought by 38 U.S. states. In Europe, Ireland and Britain dropped their inquiries and did not impose fines after Google agreed to delete data illegally collected in their countries. The French regulator, the National Commission on Computing and Liberty, fined Google &#x20ac;100,000 in 2011. The lone criminal investigation to result from the incident, initiated by the state prosecutor in Hamburg, was closed without charges being brought last year. Privacy law is enforced at the national level in the European Union. The top E.U. privacy body, the Article 29 working group, is an advisory committee to the European Commission and does not have the legal power to levy fines. Mr. Caspar, the Hamburg privacy regulator, called on European lawmakers who are considering revisions to the main data protection law for the Union to allow for fines of up to 2 percent of a company's annual sales. Based on Google's revenue last year, the maximum fine would have been $1 billion. Mr. Caspar described the proposed 2 percent penalty for data protection violations as ''economically significant.'' European lawmakers are not expected to complete their deliberations on the privacy revisions until next year at the earliest. The European Parliament's lead committee considering the legislation, the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee, is to vote on the bill in late May but may be forced to postpone action. Lawmakers have proposed more than 3,000 amendments, many of which would weaken or eliminate its main provisions. ''I have never seen this magnitude of lobbying before on an issue before the Parliament,'' said Ms. Fielder, the Privacy International official who is following the legislation for her organization. The support of the Union's 27 nations, which are represented on the Council of Ministers, a second Brussels body that functions as an upper house in the legislative process, will also be key to passage of new data protection legislation. But in the upper chamber, too, lobbying against the measure has been intense. The British government, whose administration favors a light-touch regulatory regime, attempted during the council's early discussions this year to downgrade the data protection revisions to a voluntary recommendation. But the British were rebuffed by German, French and other Continental governments favoring stricter controls, according to a copy of meeting protocols obtained by the International Herald Tribune. The British government has continued to lobby, Ms. Fielder said, to limit the scope of the legislation. European Parliament lawmakers face re-election next May, and if they do not pass revisions before then, backers of the legislation will probably have to return to the drawing board, Ms. Fielder said. ''That could set back the entire issue for years,'' she said. "
Protecting Europe's Privacy,"Here we go again: Another violation of the basic right to privacy. Another public outcry. Another blow to citizens' trust in the security of their personal data. Yet more evidence that something fundamental has to change if we want to stop citizens from worrying about somebody watching every time they visit a Web site or write an e-mail. The Prism scheme allows the national security agencies of the United States to access E.U. citizens' personal data. While the scale of the program is not yet entirely clear, Europeans are being put at a severe disadvantage compared with U.S. citizens. Through Prism, American national security authorities are able to survey E.U. citizens in a way that would likely be unconstitutional if applied to U.S. nationals. What is more, E.U. citizens are not even given a chance to use American courts to attain any kind of remedy or recourse.  This is a wake-up call for all those who have been blocking the European Commission's reform of Europe's data protection rules -- ignoring just how much consumers worry about attacks on their right to privacy. The vast majority of citizens have long suspected that their data held by companies could be used -- or abused -- without them knowing about it. This lack of trust is highly damaging to citizens' faith in the rule of law. It is also damaging to economic growth, as vast swaths of our economy depend on citizens entrusting business with their data. Those who ignore people's concerns are putting a lot more at stake than they probably realize. The European Commission has answered such concerns. Europe is one of the few places in the world that already has strong data protection rules, dating from 1995. And we have proposed to reform the E.U.'s data protection rules to make them even stronger -- and to set clear rules for the flow of data beyond Europe. The reform, adopted by the commission in January 2012, still needs to be adopted by member states sitting on the council and by the European Parliament to become law. Only if we enact this reform will citizens regain their trust in the way their personal data is handled. People must be given greater control over their data, with a reinforced right to be forgotten and a right to data portability. People need to know that staying silent is not the same as giving consent to have your data processed. And they need a guarantee that when their privacy has been violated, they are not the last ones to find out about it, via leaks in the media. The Prism scandal caused a storm in Europe because it hit a raw nerve. Europeans care about their privacy. They want rules that can help prevent violations of their rights by companies or law enforcement agencies from Europe and beyond. The tools to enable us to deal with this kind of scenario are contained in the European Commission's proposal. It's time that governments as well as members of the European Parliament show their commitment to protecting citizens' data. It's time they start working with the commission in a sober, constructive way to make sure the proposals are adopted swiftly. The E.U.'s draft law contains four key building blocks for a system of strong data protection. The first one is a clear provision on the territory where the rules apply. It has to be made certain that companies from outside Europe abide by E.U. data protection laws when they offer and sell products and services to consumers in the Union. If you want to play in our backyard, you have to play by our rules. Secondly, we need a broad definition of personal data. This should include not just the content of e-mails and phone calls, for example, but related traffic data as well, such as information on where something was sent from or how long somebody spent talking on the phone. Thirdly, we must not limit the rules to those companies that collect citizens' data. Rather, we have to include processors of those data as well -- such as cloud providers -- because, as the Prism scandal shows, they also present an avenue for those who want to access data. The E.U. needs specific rules on the obligations and liability of those processors. And finally we must have safeguards against the unfettered international transfer of data. The rules must ensure that E.U. citizens' data are transferred to non-European law enforcement authorities only in situations that are well defined, exceptional and subject to judicial review. The Prism scandal has sparked a debate about civil liberties in general and privacy in particular. Politicians in Europe and beyond should show that they have listened. Trust is something that is earned, not given. The E.U.'s data protection reform is the right tool to earn citizens' trust. It is within our reach. It is time to act. Viviane Reding is vice president of the European Commission and the E.U. justice commissioner. "
Obama's German Storm,"LONDON -- Germany is normally a welcoming place for American leaders. But President Barack Obama will walk into a German storm Tuesday provoked by revelations about the Prism and Boundless Informant (who comes up with these names?) surveillance programs of the U.S. National Security Agency. No nation, after the Nazis and the Stasi, has such intense feelings about personal privacy as Germany. The very word ''Datenschutz,'' or data protection, is a revered one. The notion that the United States has been able to access the e-mails or Facebook accounts or Skype conversations of German citizens has been described as ''monstrous'' by Peter Schaar, the official responsible for enforcing Germany's strict privacy rules. When the German bureaucracy starts talking about monstrous American behavior, take note.  What was scripted as a celebration of U.S.-German bonds on the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's ''Ich bin ein Berliner'' speech has turned into a charged presidential visit underlining how two nations that once had the same views about a shared enemy -- the Soviet Union -- now think differently about global threats and how to balance security and freedom in confronting them. It would not be a surprise if Obama faced a banner or two at the Brandenburg Gate equating the United States with the Stasi; or, in an allusion to the chilling movie about the former East German spy service, one with this rebuke: ''America, Respect the Lives of Others.'' A half-century ago, Kennedy said, ''Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect, but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us.'' History plays devilish tricks even on the best-intentioned: Obama needs to find language of equal directness now to allay German fury about perceived American intrusion into their essential freedoms. Saying U.S. actions were legal under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which they apparently were, will not cut it. This is a crisis of American credibility. Hillary Clinton made an open and secure Internet supporting freedom around the world a cornerstone of her tenure as secretary of state. She called it the ''21st century statecraft'' agenda. It was an important program. Little survives of it, however, if its primary supporter -- the United States -- turns out to be the main proponent of mass global surveillance. No wonder the Chinese and Russians are reveling: You see, we told you so! Last month, Obama made an important speech about security and freedom at the National Defense University. It was about lost American balance. He acknowledged that in the open-ended, post-9/11 war on terror, the president had been granted ''unbound powers'' and the United States had ''compromised our basic values.'' He vowed to end that unwinnable war (''This war, like all wars, must end''), and curtail the drone program. It amounted to a commitment to revoke what has, in some respects, been an undeclared State of Emergency. There is a parallel between the drones and the surveillance program. Overshoot is inevitable when essential checks and balances erode. One flying robot becomes an army of them dropping bombs. A request to monitor one e-mail account becomes a technology-driven lurch toward capturing all the Internet traffic coming into the United States. And Germans start having nightmares about the digital footprints of their lives stored in a vast facility in Utah. Obama needs to reprise some of his speech about American rebalancing and the end of the post-9/11 disorientation. He needs to spell out how and why requests are made to the FISA court for approval to monitor foreigners' online activities (last year there were 1,856 FISA applications, of which 100 percent were approved.) He needs to demonstrate that what has been done is proportional to the threat. Europeans -- and Americans -- have a right to know more about the standards applied in this secret court. Google and other companies want to publish the terms of FISA requests: This would be helpful. Nobody knows if a single FISA request may involve one e-mail account or thousands. As with drones, Obama must commit to curtailment through greater oversight and accountability. If the president is serious about winding down the American war that began a dozen years ago, Berlin is a good place to advance that cause. It is the post-Cold-War city par excellence, a vibrant demonstration of how American power in the service of its values can advance freedom. Angela Merkel, who grew up on the other side of the Wall, will press Obama on surveillance. Given national anger it is a political necessity for her. But indignation is not enough for Europe. It needs to step up and help America defend Internet freedom. Ben Scott, who was the policy adviser for innovation in Clinton's State Department and is now based in Berlin, told me: ''To be credible on the global stage, it now has to be more than the U.S. pushing the Internet freedom agenda -- and the European Union could be particularly important.'' That agenda matters; indeed I cannot think of a more important one for the 21st century. Just look at Turkey. "
Between Paranoia and Naïveté,"Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit. THE National Security Agency scandal has given us Germans a nostalgic summer. How self-assured we have been, especially we journalists, in lambasting the alleged surveillance of our e-mail and phone calls by American spooks. It reminds us how far we've come from our various totalitarian pasts -- a point of pride as much as humility. Throughout the debate, though, I have had a slight feeling of complacency. I don't deny the dangers in storing huge amounts of data. But we Germans are getting upset for the wrong reasons.  The German concern for data protection stems from the early 1980s, when the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that every citizen had the right to know who kept what data on him, particularly the state. As a result, data storage as such -- regardless of whether anybody actually reads it -- is considered an infringement on civil liberties. Since then we have not really updated our understanding of privacy, despite the advent of the Internet, fiber-optic cables and smartphones. Among other things, such obsolescence leaves us unable to communicate our concerns with the United States. If we could find more contemporary explanations for our angst, we would probably find it easier to convince our American friends that it is important to agree on international standards on data protection. Somewhere between German paranoia and American naïveté lies the proper degree of concern. But where? Put briefly, the traditional German paranoia about personal data goes like this: America and Germany may be democracies, but states can change. The intelligence agencies might one day use their knowledge to identify and intimidate citizens. We remember the Gestapo. We remember the Stasi. The American position, in contrast, holds that while it's not nice that the N.S.A. taps the world's communications, the real dangers to liberty today derive from terrorists. What if the intelligence agencies fail again in connecting the dots? Remember 9/11? Both sides have a flawed view of history. Germans tend to forget that, for more than 60 years, our government has not misused citizens' data -- at least not on a scale that could in any way invoke memories of a totalitarian past. And even if, against all probability, Germany experiences another dictatorship, the government's knowing about your Facebook friends will be the least of your problems. German angst also ignores the fact that the world has moved on: most people no longer feel uncomfortable sharing personal, even private information. In 1983 the West German defense secretary sacked Günter Kiessling, the deputy supreme NATO commander for Europe, because of rumors that Mr. Kiessling was gay; at the time, this was considered a possibility for blackmail. Today, Germany has a gay foreign minister. We have been through what Germans call a Wertewandel: a change in values. The more liberal a society, the more comfortable citizens feel in handling their data. And as more data are shared, the more the individual enjoys the relative protection a fish enjoys in a school. Data collection by American governments appears driven by another kind of misguided angst. ''Why can't we collect all the signals, all the time?'' asked Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the director of the N.S.A., in 2008. That's astonishing to German ears. Not only Barack Obama, but all future presidents, should feel highly uncomfortable about a security apparatus that aspires to omniscience. Imagine the next Edward J. Snowden strives not for a global debate on privacy, but simply for money. How many rubles, how many renminbis would certain governments or companies pay for just a snapshot of the N.S.A.'s hard drives? And if data can be stored, it can also be altered. Imagine someone taps the N.S.A. computers, alters certain information and diverts it back into the data stream. What would be the impact of such a breach on, say, high-frequency trading? Finally, we know from the natural sciences that complex systems are often smarter than their individual elements. No ant knows how an anthill works, but all ants profit from the hill. The same is true for the Internet. It is an emergent system that functions so well because it works equally for everybody. No single user is able to control the whole. If this changes, the Internet might cease to offer the greatest benefit for the greatest number but might be directed to bring advantage to a minority -- the rulers. Could these be starting points for a common understanding on modern, effective data protection? Neither Germans nor Americans hold a monopoly on the best tradition of data collection or protection. Instead, one complements the other. Given both our historical baggage, shouldn't we start the debate by trying to keep our respective ideologies off the negotiating table? "
"Free Apps for Nearly Every Health Problem, but What About Privacy?","Need to lose weight, quit smoking, improve your sex life or get a better night's sleep? There's an app for that -- all of it -- and more. Thousands of mobile apps are available to improve your health and fitness. But beware.  Health apps can provide information and motivation to help you manage your well-being, and they're easy to use and often free. But they may not have protecting your privacy as a priority. Health apps collect all sorts of personal information, like your name, e-mail address, age, height and weight. Others get even more detailed, depending on the focus of the app; fertility apps, for instance, allow you to enter details of your menstrual cycle, and exercise apps allow you to post the route of your daily jog. Yet, an analysis of 43 popular wellness apps by the nonprofit Privacy Rights Clearinghouse found that many apps connect to advertising and data analysis sites without the user's knowledge. And, they often transmit unencrypted information over insecure network connections -- possibly including your medical and pharmaceutical search terms, like those for sexually transmitted diseases or antipsychotic drugs. That's the computer equivalent of sending a postcard, rather than a letter -- it's easy for others on a network to read what's being transmitted, said Craig Michael Lie Njie, a consultant who did the technical analysis for the report. For the analysis, financed by the California Consumer Protection Foundation, the clearinghouse used apps available on the iTunes App Store, for iOS devices, and Google Play for Android phones and tablets. (The report didn't identify the apps, saying its goal is to educate consumers and app developers.) The report concluded that health apps posed ''considerable'' privacy risks for consumers, and users shouldn't assume any of their data on a mobile app was private. Only 13 percent of free apps, and 10 percent of paid apps, encrypted all data connections between the app and the developer's Web site. Many apps don't have privacy policies, and those that do don't always adequately describe the potential risks. More than a quarter of the free apps, and 40 percent of the paid apps, had no privacy policy at all. Robin Thurston, chief executive of MapMyFitness, which offers a group of exercise sites and apps including the popular MapMyRun, said his company had developed a detailed privacy policy explaining how user information was used. It also includes a link for users who want to opt out of certain kind of ads. ''Our apps are not passing any individual health information to any third-party services,'' he said. ''I can tell you we are not doing that with people's information.'' He advised consumers to consider the credibility of the health apps they choose. Better-known brands and developers with a track record -- in which he includes MapMyFitness -- have more resources to spend on comprehensive data security, whereas smaller or offshore operations may be less reliable. With very small app developers, ''You could be sending your data into someone's home server to be stored,'' he said. ''I'm not sure consumers are aware of that.'' Many apps encourage users to share information through social media sites like Facebook, to seek support for their weight loss or fitness goal. But you should be cautious about revealing details of your medical conditions, since once information is public you have little control over it. ''We're not telling people not to use them,'' Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, said of health apps. ''But you should know what you're getting into.'' Here are some questions to consider. â-  Are there any laws governing the use of health information I may share using an app? Medical information that's shared directly between you and your doctor or your hospital is covered by the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa. But there's little regulatory protection for health information shared over consumer apps, unless it's a device prescribed or provided by your physician. In most cases, ''You're on your own with these commercially available apps,'' said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a senior staff technologist who works on health privacy issues at the Center for Democracy and Technology. â-  How can I be sure my information won't be shared with marketing or advertising sites? You should assume any information you impart using an app will be shared, Ms. Givens said. But you may get better protection by using paid apps, rather than free ones, because paid apps don't rely solely on advertising revenue -- and so are less likely to share information with outside firms that gather information to target their ads. â-  What can I do to protect myself? Try to read an app's privacy policy before using it. The policy should describe the app's information-sharing practices, and may give instructions for opting out of some of them. If it's not available within the app, it may be posted on the developer's Web site. You can even try to contact the developer with questions. Privacy policies, however, are mainly aimed at protecting app developers from lawsuits, rather than protecting the privacy of your information, said Mr. Lie Njie. He advises sharing only data that you wouldn't mind becoming public. "
Internet Firms Step Up Efforts To Stop Spying,"SAN FRANCISCO -- When Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive, recently announced the company's biggest security overhaul in more than a decade, she did not exactly receive a standing ovation. Ordinary users asked Ms. Mayer why Yahoo was not doing more. Privacy activists were more blunt. ''Even after today's announcement, Yahoo still lags far behind Google on web security,'' said Christopher Soghoian, a technology analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. For big Internet outfits, it is no longer enough to have a fast-loading smartphone app or cool messaging service. In the era of Edward J. Snowden and his revelations of mass government surveillance, companies are competing to show users how well their data is protected from prying eyes, with billions of dollars in revenue hanging in the balance.  On Thursday, Microsoft will be the latest technology company to announce plans to shield its services from outside surveillance. It is in the process of adding state-of-the-art encryption features to various consumer services and internally at its data centers. The announcement follows similar efforts by Google, Mozilla, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo in what has effectively become a digital arms race with the National Security Agency as the companies react to what some have called the ''Snowden Effect.'' While security has long simmered as a concern for users, many companies were reluctant to employ modern protections, worried that upgrades would slow down connections and add complexity to their networks. But the issue boiled over six months ago, when documents leaked by Mr. Snowden described efforts by the N.S.A. and its intelligence partners to spy on millions of Internet users. More than half of Americans surveyed say N.S.A. surveillance has intruded on their personal privacy rights, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted in November. The revelations also shook Internet companies, which have been trying to reassure customers that they are doing what they can to protect their data from spying. They have long complied with legal orders to hand over information, but were alarmed by more recent news that the N.S.A. was also accessing their data without their knowledge. ''We want to ensure that governments use legal process rather than technological brute force to obtain customer data -- it's as simple as that,'' said Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, in an interview. Mr. Smith said his company would also open ''transparency centers'' where foreign governments can inspect the company's code in an effort to assure them that it does not plant back doors for spy agencies in its products. Already, the Snowden revelations threaten to erode the market share of American technology companies abroad. In India, government officials are now barred from using email services that have servers located in the United States. In Brazil, lawmakers are pushing for laws that would force foreign companies to spend billions redesigning their systems -- and possibly the entire Internet -- to keep Brazilian data from leaving the country. Forrester Research projected the fallout could cost the so-called cloud computing industry as much as $180 billion -- a quarter of its revenue -- by 2016. ''The world is quickly being divided into companies that are secure and companies that are not,'' said Bhaskar Chakravorti, a dean of international business and finance at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. One by one, technology companies have been scrambling to plug security holes. The best defense, security experts say, is using Transport Layer Security, a type of encryption familiar to many through the ''https'' and padlock symbol at the beginning of Web addresses that use the technology. It uses a long sequence of numbers -- a master key -- that scrambles sensitive data like passwords, credit card details, intellectual property and personal information between a user and a website while in transit. Banks and other financial sites have used such security for years, and Google and Twitter along with Microsoft's email service made it standard long ago. Facebook adopted https systemwide this year. And Ms. Mayer said Yahoo would finally allow consumers to encrypt all their Yahoo data in January. But as many sites move to https, security experts say more advanced security measures are needed. If a government can crack the master key -- or obtain it through court orders -- it could go back and decrypt past communications for millions of users. That's why companies like Google, Mozilla, Facebook and Twitter have added another layer of protection, called Perfect Forward Secrecy. That technology adds a second lock to each user's transmissions, with the key changed frequently. Microsoft plans to add the encryption method next year, but Yahoo has not said whether it will add it. ''Perfect Forward Secrecy is a billion different secrets, and it's not protected by one central secret,'' said Scott Renfro, a Facebook software engineer who works on the company's security infrastructure. So even if an outsider obtained the master key, it would still have to crack the other keys, over and over again. ''This type of protection should have been engineered into all web systems and all Internet systems to begin with,'' said Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, an engineer at Twitter. The technology has existed for two decades, but companies were slow to adopt it because it added complexity and introduced a delay to Internet transactions, which can encourage impatient users to flee for faster sites. But many of those issues were resolved by Google when it applied Perfect Forward Secrecy in 2011, said Adam Langley, a software engineer at the company. Google shared its improvements with the broader tech community. Still, technical solutions can be trumped by law. While https and Perfect Forward Secrecy protect the data transmission, law enforcement agencies can still compel companies to hand the data over from their servers, where it is stored. So Internet companies are trying to ensure they are at least blocking unauthorized access by addressing other security issues, including a hole that leaves users vulnerable at the very beginning of a site visit. When users want to log into, say, Google's Gmail, their Internet browser checks the site's security certificate to make sure it's not an impostor. Some security experts believe that hackers are nearly capable of cracking the 1024-bit encryption keys that protect the certificates. But an industry standards group is requiring that, starting next year, all new and renewed certificate keys use 2048-bit encryption, which is far more difficult to break. Ultimately, however, every security advance is met by new threats. ''Attacks don't get worse,'' Mr. Langley said. ''They only get better.'' "
U.S. Tech Firms Facing Stronger European Data Protection Measures,"In the end, all of those trans-Atlantic flights may not have paid off. Over the last year, representatives of the United States government and American technology companies have repeatedly traveled to Brussels and Strasbourg in the hopes of containing an effort by the European Commission to strengthen data protection rules for citizens of the European Union. But on Tuesday morning, Jan Philipp Albrecht, a representative of the European Parliament reviewing the draft regulation, made public a report in which he proposed even stronger measures.  Mr. Albrecht's proposals represent his own opinions and may not be approved by his parliamentary colleagues. Even so, his recommendations indicate that American lobbying efforts are up against European momentum. ""I think they are trying to slow a moving train, which is difficult to do,"" said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington. Last January, the European Commission introduced a draft proposal for new data protection rules. The proposed rule would supersede a data protection directive from 1995, which laid out principles for each member state to enact individually. The draft regulation clarifies and elaborates on those original principles -- such as the need for companies and institutions to obtain citizens' consent before collecting information about them. It would grant European Union citizens a fundamental new right: data portability or a citizen's right to easily transfer his or her own personal posts, photos, and video from one online service site to another. And it comes with a big stick: Companies that violated the rule would be liable to penalties of up to 2  percent of worldwide revenues. Although the effort is intended to standardize and consolidate the enforcement of data protection regulation across the 27 European Union countries, some American regulators, industry groups and scholars have objected. They say the draft rule was overly broad and burdensome for technology companies to carry out. Now Mr. Albrecht has proposed further strengthening the data protections by granting citizens additional control over information collected about them - like the right not to be subject to profiling. In his report, Mr. Albrecht, a member of the German Green Party who is the representative of the European Parliament committee reviewing the draft proposal, also said citizens must consent to data collection by opting in and not be asked to opt out by changing a preselected option like a already-checked box. ""The use of default options which the data subject is required to modify to object to the processing, such as preticked boxes, does not express free consent,"" Mr. Albrecht wrote. In a phone interview, Mr. Albrecht said the European Parliament was likely to strengthen parts of the proposed regulation. ""There is a huge interest of European citizens in having strong data protection,"" Mr. Albrecht said. That could pose challenges to technology companies. Granting people the right to transfer the updates and photos they posted on Facebook to Google Plus, for example, may sound perfectly reasonable, said Yianni Lagos, a legal and policy fellow at Ohio State University and the co-author of a recent analysis of the European draft regulation published in the Maryland Law Review. But the proposed rule broadly requires that a company transfer a person's data ""without hindrance"" and in a commonly used format. ""We're not exactly sure what that means,"" Mr. Lagos said. ""The largest challenge is the concept of interoperability,"" Mr. Lagos said. ""Translating from a coded format to a commonly used format, that is what will be difficult and costly to achieve."" Unhindered transfer of a person's entire record could also increase the breadth of identity theft, Mr. Lagos said: ""One-time access by a hacker could turn into a lifetime data breach."" Technology companies, he added, must now face the increased liability that could come with the proposed penalty for violators. ""The big difference is the fine,"" Mr. Yianni said. ""Now there's a lot more reason to comply.""  "
Google Says It Has Uncovered Iranian Spy Campaign,"Google said Wednesday that it had uncovered a vast Iranian spy campaign that had been targeting tens of thousands of Iranian citizens over the past three weeks. ""These campaigns, which originate from within Iran, represent a significant jump in the overall volume of phishing activity in the region,"" the company said in a blog post. ""The timing and targeting of the campaigns suggest that the attacks are politically motivated in connection with the Iranian presidential election on Friday.""  The company said that thousands of its users inside Iran had been the targets of a sophisticated e-mail phishing campaign in which attackers send users a link that, when clicked, sent them to a fake Google sign-in page where the attackers could steal log-in credentials.  The surveillance campaign is just the latest evidence that political groups are increasingly using digital means to keep tabs on their opposition. During elections last April in Malaysia, security researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab found evidence that servers in Malaysia were running FinSpy, a surveillance tool sold to governments by the British surveillance firm Gamma Group. According to security researchers, the targets appeared to be members of Malaysia's opposition party.  Google would not say how it had traced the current spy campaign to Iran because it did not want to tip off attackers. It did say, however, that it was confident the attackers were the same ones behind a sophisticated attack in 2011 on DigiNotar, a Dutch company that sells certificates that validate the security of a Web site. By compromising the certificate authority, the attackers were able to intercept users' Web traffic and compromise their computers.  Security researchers who analyzed the DigiNotar attack believe the company was compromised by Iran or hackers working on its behalf. By tying the latest Iranian phishing campaign to Iran, Google's findings on Wednesday seemed to confirm that Iran was also behind the DigiNotar attack. Of the DigiNotar attack, Phil Zimmermann, a pioneer of encryption software said, ""There are thousands of Iranian dissidents in prison today because of that."" Compared with the public uproar that followed Iran's 2009 elections, the run-up to this week's elections has been tightly controlled. Many leaders of the 2009 opposition have fled the country, been silenced or jailed The two main presidential challengers in those elections, Hussein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, remain under house arrest.  "
China Denies Allegations of Conducting Cyberwarfare,"SHANGHAI -- A day after a United States security company accused a People's Liberation Army unit in Shanghai of engaging in cyberwarfare against American corporations, organizations and government agencies, China's defense ministry issued a strong denial and insisted that the report was flawed.  At a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday, the ministry suggested that the allegations were destructive and challenged the study, which was produced by Mandiant, an American computer security company. The report identified P.L.A. Unit 61398 in Shanghai as one of the most aggressive computer hacking operations in the world. Geng Yansheng, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, said that China had been the victim of cyberattacks that have originated in the United States and that Mandiant had mischaracterized China's activities. ''Chinese military forces have never supported any hacking activities,'' Mr. Geng said at the briefing. ''The claim by the Mandiant company that the Chinese military engages in Internet espionage has no foundation in fact.'' On Tuesday, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hong Lei, made similar remarks, arguing that cyberattacks were difficult to trace because they were ''often carried out internationally and are typically done so anonymously.'' The New York Times reported on Tuesday that a growing body of digital forensic evidence pointed to the involvement of the army unit in Shanghai and that American intelligence officials had also been tracking the unit's activities. On its Web site, Mandiant released a long report on Tuesday detailing some of its evidence, including Internet protocol addresses and even the identities of several Chinese individuals it thinks were behind some of the attacks. Mandiant said it had monitored the hackers as they logged onto social networking sites or through e-mail accounts. Attempts to contact two of the individuals through phone numbers and instant message services were unsuccessful. In one case, an individual, whose online profile said he was 28 years old and a graduate of a university that specializes in computer science, declined to answer questions. Several military analysts said they had also traced some serious cyberattacks back to the People's Liberation Army and its Shanghai Unit 61398, which is known to be engaged in network security. Still, many security experts concede that it is difficult if not impossible to know for certain where attacks originate, because hackers often take control of computers in various places. Chinese officials have insisted in recent years that China is one of the biggest targets of cyberattacks. ''Statistics show that Chinese military terminals connected to the Internet have been subjected to large numbers of attacks from abroad,'' the defense ministry said on Wednesday, adding that Internet protocol addresses ''indicate that a considerable number of these attacks are from the United States, but we have never used this as a reason to accuse the United States.'' ''Every country should handle the problem of cybersecurity in a professional and responsible manner,'' the ministry said. "
China's Military Is Accused by U.S. In Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Monday explicitly accused China's military of mounting attacks on American government computer systems and defense contractors, saying one motive could be to map ''military capabilities that could be exploited during a crisis.'' While some recent estimates have more than 90 percent of cyberespionage in the United States originating in China, the accusations relayed in the Pentagon's annual report to Congress on Chinese military capabilities were remarkable in their directness. Until now the administration avoided directly accusing both the Chinese government and the People's Liberation Army of using cyberweapons against the United States in a deliberate, government-developed strategy to steal intellectual property and gain strategic advantage. ''In 2012, numerous computer systems around the world, including those owned by the U.S. government, continued to be targeted for intrusions, some of which appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military,'' the nearly 100-page report said. The report, released Monday, described China's primary goal as stealing industrial technology, but said many intrusions also seemed aimed at obtaining insights into American policy makers' thinking. It warned that the same information-gathering could easily be used for ''building a picture of U.S. network defense networks, logistics, and related military capabilities that could be exploited during a crisis.''  It was unclear why the administration chose the Pentagon report to make assertions that it has long declined to make at the White House. A White House official declined to say at what level the report was cleared. A senior defense official said ''this was a thoroughly coordinated report,'' but did not elaborate. On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, criticized the report. ''China has repeatedly said that we resolutely oppose all forms of hacker attacks,'' she said. ''We're willing to carry out an even-tempered and constructive dialogue with the U.S. on the issue of Internet security. But we are firmly opposed to any groundless accusations and speculations, since they will only damage the cooperation efforts and atmosphere between the two sides to strengthen dialogue and cooperation.'' Missing from the Pentagon report was any acknowledgment of the similar abilities being developed in the United States, where billions of dollars are spent each year on cyberdefense and constructing increasingly sophisticated cyberweapons. Recently the director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith Alexander, who is also commander of the military's fast-growing Cyber Command, told Congress that he was creating more than a dozen offensive cyberunits, designed to mount attacks, when necessary, at foreign computer networks. When the United States mounted its cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear facilities early in President Obama's first term, Mr. Obama expressed concern to aides that China and other states might use the American operations to justify their own intrusions. But the Pentagon report describes something far more sophisticated: a China that has now leapt into the first ranks of offensive cybertechnologies. It is investing in electronic warfare capabilities in an effort to blind American satellites and other space assets, and hopes to use electronic and traditional weapons systems to gradually push the United States military presence into the mid-Pacific nearly 2,000 miles from China's coast. The report argues that China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, commissioned last September, is the first of several carriers the country plans to deploy over the next 15 years. It said the carrier would not reach ''operational effectiveness'' for three or four years, but is already set to operate in the East and South China Seas, the site of China's territorial disputes with several neighbors, including Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The report notes a new carrier base under construction in Yuchi. The report also detailed China's progress in developing its stealth aircraft, first tested in January 2011. Three months ago the Obama administration would not officially confirm reports in The New York Times, based in large part on a detailed study by the computer security firm Mandiant, that identified P.L.A. Unit 61398 near Shanghai as the likely source of many of the biggest thefts of data from American companies and some government institutions. Until Monday, the strongest critique of China had come from Thomas E. Donilon, the president's national security adviser, who said in a speech at the Asia Society in March that American companies were increasingly concerned about ''cyberintrusions emanating from China on an unprecedented scale,'' and that ''the international community cannot tolerate such activity from any country.'' He stopped short of blaming the Chinese government for the espionage. But government officials said the overall issue of cyberintrusions would move to the center of the United States-China relationship, and it was raised on recent trips to Beijing by Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey. To bolster its case, the report argues that cyberweapons have become integral to Chinese military strategy. It cites two major public works of military doctrine, ''Science of Strategy'' and ''Science of Campaigns,'' saying they identify ''information warfare (I.W.) as integral to achieving information superiority and an effective means for countering a stronger foe.'' But it notes that neither document ''identifies the specific criteria for employing a computer network attack against an adversary,'' though they ''advocate developing capabilities to compete in this medium.'' It is a critique the Chinese could easily level at the United States, where the Pentagon has declined to describe the conditions under which it would use offensive cyberweapons. The Iran operation was considered a covert action, run by intelligence agencies, though many techniques used to manipulate Iran's computer controllers would be common to a military program. The Pentagon report also explicitly states that China's investments in the United States aim to bolster its own military technology. ''China continues to leverage foreign investments, commercial joint ventures, academic exchanges, the experience of repatriated Chinese students and researchers, and state-sponsored industrial and technical espionage to increase the level of technologies and expertise available to support military research, development and acquisition.'' But the report does not address how the Obama administration should deal with that problem in an economically interconnected world where the United States encourages those investments, and its own in China, to create jobs and deepen the relationship between the world's No. 1 and No. 2 economies. Some experts have argued that the threat from China has been exaggerated. They point out that the Chinese government -- unlike, say, Iran or North Korea -- has such deep investments in the United States that it cannot afford to mount a crippling cyberstrike on the country. The report estimates that China's defense budget is $135 billion to $215 billion, a large range attributable in part to the opaqueness of Chinese budgeting. While the figure is huge in Asia, the top estimate would still be less than a third of what the United States spends every year. Some of the report's most interesting elements examine the debate inside China over whether this is a moment for the country to bide its time, focusing on internal challenges, or to directly challenge the United States and other powers in the Pacific. But it said that ''proponents of a more active and assertive Chinese role on the world stage'' -- a group whose members it did not name -- ''have suggested that China would be better served by a firm stance in the face of U.S. or other regional pressure.''

Internet Sleuths Add Evidence to Chinese Military Hacking Accusations,"Regular users of the Internet have been busy in the week since The New York Times reported that Mandiant, a computer security firm, had tied a prolific Chinese hacking group to a specific People's Liberation Army unit in Shanghai. Chinese-speaking users and amateur hackers have scoured the Internet for traces of the online personas of those who Mandiant claims work on behalf of China's P.L.A. Unit 61398.  The new evidence, while circumstantial, adds to the signs suggesting Chinese military efforts to hack into American corporate computer systems. Mandiant said that in one case, people were able to trace one of the P.L.A.'s hackers to an apartment building located 600 meters from the military unit's headquarters. In another, they were able to trace one hacker back to the P.L.A.'s Information Engineering University, described by American computer security researchers as one of the Chinese military's top training schools for computer hacking.  They also found recruitment notices for Unit 61398, suggesting the group has been active since at least 2004, despite the fact that the unit's headquarters were not built until later.  In its report, Mandiant singled out a hacker named ""DOTA,"" possibly shorthand for the video game ""Defense of the Ancients,"" which is often abbreviated to DotA. That hacker created e-mail accounts that were used to begin several cyberattacks. The password for several of those accounts were a play on the Chinese military unit's designation.  To register the accounts, DOTA used a Shanghai phone number. This past week, Chinese-speaking Internet users disclosed on Twitter that DOTA's telephone number was listed in a 2009 ad for a Shanghai apartment rental. The apartment is 600 meters from Unit 61398's headquarters. Another online persona that Mandiant singled out was of a military hacker named ""Superhard."" The author of a cybercrime blog, Cyb3rsleuth, connected the user name ""Superhard_M"" to the e-mail address mei_qiang_82@hotmail.com That e-mail address was also used in a job posting, in which the person lists his skills and interests as ""network security and developing hacking tools."" The address listed in the post matched the address for the Information Engineering University. In a Northrop Grumman report for the U.S.-China Economy and Security Review Commission last year, defense analysts said the school, in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, ""is perhaps the military university with the most comprehensive involvement in information warfare and computer network operations training, planning and possibly also execution."" Cyb3rsleuth found that a P.L.A. university student named Mei Qiang was co-author of two papers about hacking in 2007 and 2008, one titled ""HTTP Session Hijacking on Switch LAN and Its Countermeasures"" and the other ""Stack Protection Mechanisms in Windows Vista."" Mandiant's report found that Unit 61398's headquarters in the Pudong new area of Shanghai was not built until early 2007. But China Digital Times found a 2004 military recruitment notice on a Zhejiang University Web site: ""Unit 61398 of China's People's Liberation Army (located in Pudong District, Shanghai) seeks to recruit 2003-class computer science graduate students."" ""This corroborates our assertions concerning the kinds of personnel that Unit 61398 recruits,"" Mandiant said in a blog post online. ""This also indicates Unit 61398 has been operating in Pudong since 2004, even though the current headquarters facility was not built and operational until years later."" "
"In the Murky World of Bitcoin, Fraud Is Quicker Than the Law","The call went out on Twitter: ''For insane profits come and join the pump.'' It was an invitation to a penny stock-style pump-and-dump scheme -- only this one involved Bitcoin, the soaring, slightly scary virtual currency that has beckoned and bewildered people around the world. While such bid 'em up, sell 'em off scams are shut down in the financial markets all the time, this one and other frauds involving digital money have gone unchecked. The reason, in no small part: Government authorities do not agree on which laws apply to Bitcoin -- or even on what Bitcoin is. The person behind the recent scheme, a trader known on Twitter as Fontas, said in a secure Internet chat that he operated with little fear of a crackdown.  For insane profits come and join the pump, there is no obligation to but it's nice to be on the right side of a price movement -- Fontas (@fontase) 25 Nov 13 ''For now, the lack of regulations allows everything to happen,'' Fontas said in the chat, where he verified his control of the Twitter account, which has thousands of followers, but did not give his identity. He added that Bitcoin and its users would benefit when someone steps in to police this financial wild west, and would stop his schemes when they do. Chinese authorities drew attention to the issue on Thursday when they announced that they were barring Chinese banks from making Bitcoin transactions. The same day, the Bank of France issued its own warning about the potential risks. The news sent the price of Bitcoin tumbling, but it quickly bounced back to near its all-time high of around $1,200. Bitcoins are little more than computer code -- created according to a set algorithm and traded between online wallets using virtual keys. Some people insist that virtual currencies could become a revolutionary new form of payment in the real world. Bank of America became the first major Wall Street bank to release research about Bitcoin on Thursday, noting that it could become ''a major player in both e-commerce and money transfer.'' So far, though, Bitcoin has been driven up primarily by people who are betting it will rise and rise because there is a finite supply. The initial computer program established that only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. Because there are no limits on who can buy Bitcoins, they have attracted investors of all stripes. The value of all the Bitcoins in existence is now more than $12 billion after a volatile surge increased the value by more than 1,000 percent over the last month. But the excitement over this rapid ascent has obscured the fraud, hacking and outright theft that have become an increasingly regular part of the virtual currency world -- even for the most sophisticated, legitimate players -- and the lack of any visible response from law enforcement agencies. This has allowed more than 30 episodes in which at least 1,000 Bitcoins -- or $1 million at the current rate of exchange -- were stolen or transferred illegally, according to a frequently updated list on the most popular online forum for Bitcoin. Of those cases, 10 involved losses of more than 10,000 Bitcoins, or $10 million at the current value. The authorities have only been publicly involved in one of these cases. This week, the virtual currency world has been abuzz over a heist in which 96,000 Bitcoins -- currently worth about $100 million -- were said to be taken from an online marketplace known for selling illegal drugs. Because of the murky nature of the virtual currency, thefts can be hard to verify. But the increasing stream of episodes underscores how quickly con artists can take advantage of new forms of investing and how slow the authorities can be in responding to emerging financial risks. The association of state securities regulators put digital money on its list of the top 10 threats to investors for the first time this year. At a hearing last month, three federal agencies said they were carefully tracking virtual currencies for illicit activity. But Judith M. Shaw, the top securities regulator in Maine, said that it was often hard to determine which authority should be cracking down on virtual currency fraud, or even what constitutes fraud in a market that some view as a giant bubble and others as the future of money. ''The jurisdiction has not been clearly established because it's new uncharted territory,'' Ms. Shaw said. ''Everyone is just trying to figure out how this is all going to play out.'' The five Chinese agencies that released a notice on Thursday, including the People's Bank of China, said that citizens of the country would still be allowed to buy and sell digital money, but it warned that participants ''assume the risks themselves.'' Authorities in the United States have cracked down on the criminal use of virtual currencies in a few cases, but those have been isolated situations in which the coins have been used for illegal purposes in the real world, like money laundering and trade in illicit goods. The owner of the Silk Road, a website where drugs and weapons could be bought with Bitcoins, was arrested earlier this year. But for crimes contained within the Bitcoin network -- like thefts from apparently reputable online wallets where Bitcoins are stored -- there has been almost no accountability. The largest Bitcoin payment processor in Europe, BIPS, said last month that it was hacked and that it lost about $1 million worth of Bitcoins, including coins that were in the personal online wallets of customers. The company, which is still in business, said this week that it would be ''unable to reimburse Bitcoins lost unless the stolen coins are retrieved.'' The company said that the Danish police were examining the case but added that the authorities could ''not classify this as a theft due to the current nonregulation of Bitcoin.'' ''There is absolutely no consumer protection in any sector of the Bitcoin economy,'' said Sarah Meiklejohn, a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, who researches the industry. After writing a paper on Bitcoin transactions this year, Ms. Meiklejohn said she began receiving emails almost daily from victims of theft who asked her to help track down the perpetrators. Ms. Meiklejohn said that despite the long odds of success, she had generally offered to help, knowing that the victims had nowhere else to turn. ''I figure I can at least respond to them and provide some sense they are being heard,'' Ms. Meiklejohn said. Part of the problem is that regulators have not agreed on how to classify Bitcoin. The Securities and Exchange Commission has authority to regulate securities, like stocks, in the United States. This allowed the agency to punish a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme this year because the agreement between the swindler and the victims was considered a security. But so far, the agency has not determined whether Bitcoin itself can be categorized as a security, making it hard for it to crack down on trading fraud. Chinese authorities said on Thursday that Bitcoin was a ''virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency.'' In the United States, that classification could put Bitcoin under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But that agency has not assumed responsibility. In the immediate future, the most likely source of enforcement may be the Federal Bureau of Investigation's cybersecurity team. ''It's becoming something of enough value that these agencies are going to wake up and want to find one of these thieves,'' said Patrick Murck, the general counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes virtual currencies. ''There is no way that anyone can think this is not a real thing that is not worth going after.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Target Looking Into Security Breach,"SAN FRANCISCO - Target is investigating a security breach involving stolen credit card and debit card information for millions of its customers, according to one person involved in the investigation. The breach, which was first reported Wednesday by Brian Krebs, a security blogger, began  Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, and may be ongoing, according to the person involved in the investigation who was not authorized to speak about it. It is unclear whether Target's online customers were affected. Cybercriminals appear to have targeted the point-of-sale systems in Target's retail stores, which collect information from customers' credit and debit cards, and potentially  personal identification numbers, or PINs.  Representatives for Target did not return requests for comment. The breach is currently being investigated by Target and major card companies, according to the source.  By breaching point-of-sale systems, cybercriminals can create counterfeit cards. If they were able to intercept the PIN information, as well, it is also possible that thieves could withdraw money from a customer's account through an A.T.M. A similar breach affected Barnes & Noble stores last year. In that case,  customers at 63 Barnes & Noble stores across the country, including New York City, San Diego, Miami and Chicago, were affected. To date, Target customers have not yet been made aware of the breach. Though state notification laws differ, most states require that companies notify customers of a breach if their names are compromised in combination with other information like a credit card, Social Security number or driver's license number. But states make exceptions for encrypted information. As long as companies scramble consumer information with basic encryption, the law does not require companies to tell customers about a breach. Point-of-sale systems have become a major target for cybercriminals in recent years. To pull it off, security experts said a company insider could have inserted malware into a company machine, or persuaded an unsuspecting employee to click on a malicious link that downloaded malware that gives cybercriminals a foothold into a company's point-of-sale systems. In addition to payment systems at Barnes & Noble last year, criminals also breached Global Payment Systems, one of the biggest card transactions processors. The biggest known security compromise to date was an attack at Heartland Payment Systems, another credit card processor, in 2009. Criminals used malware to break into the company's internal network and steal data for 130 million cards. ""Why do we keep hearing about this? Because criminals go where the money is,"" said Michael Sutton, a vice president for research at ZScaler, a security company. ""Typically, criminals will steal credit card information and then sell it. There's a very elaborate economy built around this type of crime. That's a very valuable asset that can be obtained completely through remote Internet access."" Security experts advise Target customers to scan their accounts for unauthorized transactions and change the PINs to their debit accounts. ""There's not a great deal customers can do, other than take the necessary steps, like changing passwords, credit card numbers if they have been informed of a breach,"" Mr. Sutton said. ""Beyond that, they can take proactive steps like shopping with reputable vendors."" ""Then again,"" he added. ""Here we are talking about one of the largest retailers in the United States. No one is immune.""  "
"40 Million Cards, Swiped","SAN FRANCISCO -- Target may have been an easy bull's-eye for criminal hackers intent on stealing credit card information, but the theft of records for 40 million store customers was hardly the worst security breach among big retailers in recent years. And the incident revealed on Thursday is unlikely to be the last. Security experts say the Target hack is a reminder of security problems facing many retailers that won't easily go away: There are weaknesses in the way payment information travels between retailers and banks. There is plenty of money to be made on the black market selling stolen credit card numbers, which can go for as little as a quarter or as much as $45 each. And American companies have been reluctant to adopt smart-chip cards, a type of credit card widely used in Europe that provides better security.  Target said that from Nov. 27 to Dec. 15 hackers stole customer names, credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates and three-digit security codes for 40 million customers who had shopped in its stores. It is currently working with a forensic team from Verizon to investigate the breach, according to one person involved in the inquiry. But there was no word as to who was behind the attack, how they got in, or what the total cost to Target may be. Thursday, visitors to the retailer's website found a site festooned in red and green save for a stark black-and-white security notice at the top. Complicating matters, Target was hit during the holiday shopping season, when fraud detection systems have a hard enough time telling legitimate transactions from fake ones. ''This is the perfect storm'' for vulnerability to hackers, said Paul Kocher, president of Cryptography Research, a company that develops technologies to prevent fraud. It may be of little comfort to its customers, but the Target hack was dwarfed by a similar break-in six years ago at T. J. Maxx, which resulted in stolen data for 90 million customers, and a breach of the card processor Heartland Payment Systems in 2009 -- the biggest on record -- which resulted in 130 million stolen card numbers. Security experts said that even if Target had installed the most cutting-edge security -- and it's not clear how Target was protecting this data -- it would not be shocking if hackers found a way in. ''It's a game of cat and mouse,'' said Steven M. Elefant, a managing director of Soaring Ventures, who was chief security officer at Heartland Payment Systems when it was breached in 2009. ''We're dealing with sophisticated bad guys that have many ways to attack.'' Mr. Elefant said the Heartland breach should have been a wake-up call to large financial institutions and retailers that they needed to increase defenses and encrypt data as it moved from the cash register to card issuers and banks. But hackers, at least, do not appear to be dissuaded by whatever changes retailers have made since then. Target has not said how its systems were compromised and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the company's point-of-sale systems had been encrypted. Mr. Elefant said, however, that most systems still transmit credit and debit card data ''in the clear,'' security speak for plain text without encryption that can easily be intercepted. When shoppers pay for store purchases with credit cards, their payment data moves from the store's terminal through the retailer's network to the acquiring bank and credit card issuer. ''At every hop it could be vulnerable,'' said Mr. Kocher. ''There have been attacks at every stop along the way.'' Even when the data is encrypted, experts say there are plenty of other weak spots criminals can target. ''Cash registers used to be just cash registers,'' said Dan Kaminsky, the chief scientist at White Ops, a security consulting company. Today, they are computers of sorts, as vulnerable to hackers as a PC. And those hackers do have an incentive. Credit and debit card numbers often sell in bulk on black market websites. Platinum cards can fetch as much as $35 and corporate cards $45. That stolen data -- someone's financial identity -- can be burned onto magnetic strips on counterfeit cards that can be used for fraudulent purchases, or to buy gift cards that can be exchanged for cash. Experts also question why -- with breaches recurring regularly and credit card fraud rampant -- American credit card issuers have not embraced smart-chip technology. The United States accounts for more than 47 percent of global credit card fraud, while generating only 24 percent of card spending, according to the Nilson Report, a card industry newsletter. More than 80 countries around the world use chip technology, but less than 1 percent of credit cards in the United States have chips. Unlike magnetic-stripe credit cards, which serve the same data every time they are swiped, chip cards offer a different encrypted mathematical value, making it harder for criminals to use stolen data for future purchases. ''The U.S. is the only world region where counterfeit fraud continues to rise,'' said David Robertson, the Nilson Report publisher. The absence of this chip technology at the physical point of sale is a large contributing factor, he added. Europe started migrating to chip cards in 2002, when Europay, MasterCard and Visa partnered on a standard for chip technology. In 2005, the card companies also shifted liability for fraud to merchants in cases where they accepted a fraudulent payment from a magnetic-stripe card, instead of a chip card. As adoption of chip cards increased, fraud levels in Europe, which peaked in 2008, began to decline, according to Euromonitor International, a research company. ''The U.S. is still the only market using these 1960s magnetic-stripe cards,'' said Mr. Kocher. Last year, major credit card companies, including Visa and MasterCard, set October 2015 as the date that merchants will be subjected to new chip card standards, which shift the burden for fraudulent magnetic-stripe transactions from issuers to merchants. It is unclear whether Target's breach will accelerate the process. Seth Eisen, a spokesman for MasterCard, said the decision to move to the more secure cards will continue to be made by each card company and merchants. In the meantime, breaches continue. ''The most important thing to realize is that 500 of the Fortune 500 are under constant attack,'' said Mr. Kaminsky. ''Nobody should be saying 'I can't believe Target got attacked' because the reality is that everybody is getting attacked.'' "
Dispute on Spam Stirs Big Assault on the Internet,"A squabble between a group fighting spam and a Dutch company that hosts Web sites said to be sending spam has escalated into one of the largest computer attacks on the Internet, causing widespread congestion and jamming crucial infrastructure around the world. Millions of ordinary Internet users have experienced delays in services or could not reach a particular Web site for a short time.  However, for the Internet engineers who run the global network the problem is more worrisome. The attacks are becoming increasingly powerful, and computer security experts worry that if they continue to escalate people may not be able to reach basic Internet services, like e-mail and online banking. The dispute started when the spam-fighting group, called Spamhaus, added the Dutch company Cyberbunker to its blacklist, which is used by e-mail providers to weed out spam. Cyberbunker, named for its headquarters, a five-story former NATO bunker, offers hosting services to any Web site ''except child porn and anything related to terrorism,'' according to its Web site. A spokesman for Spamhaus, which is based in Europe, said the attacks began on March 19, but had not stopped the group from distributing its blacklist. Patrick Gilmore, chief architect at Akamai Technologies, a digital content provider, said Spamhaus's role was to generate a list of Internet spammers. Of Cyberbunker, he added: ''These guys are just mad. To be frank, they got caught. They think they should be allowed to spam.'' Mr. Gilmore said that the attacks, which are generated by swarms of computers called botnets, concentrate data streams that are larger than the Internet connections of entire countries. He likened the technique, which uses a long-known flaw in the Internet's basic plumbing, to using a machine gun to spray an entire crowd when the intent is to kill one person. The attacks were first mentioned publicly last week by CloudFlare, an Internet security firm in Silicon Valley that was trying to defend against the attacks and as a result became a target. ''These things are essentially like nuclear bombs,'' said Matthew Prince, chief executive of CloudFlare. ''It's so easy to cause so much damage.'' The so-called distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks have reached previously unknown magnitudes, growing to a data stream of 300 billion bits per second. ''It is a real number,'' Mr. Gilmore said. ''It is the largest publicly announced DDoS attack in the history of the Internet.'' Spamhaus, one of the most prominent groups tracking spammers on the Internet, uses volunteers to identify spammers and has been described as an online vigilante group. In the past, blacklisted sites have retaliated against Spamhaus with denial-of-service attacks, in which they flood Spamhaus with traffic requests from personal computers until its servers become unreachable. But in recent weeks, the attackers hit back with a far more powerful strike that exploited the Internet's core infrastructure, called the Domain Name System, or DNS. That system functions like a telephone switchboard for the Internet. It translates the names of Web sites like Facebook.com or Google.com into a string of numbers that the Internet's underlying technology can understand. Millions of computer servers around the world perform the actual translation. In the latest incident, attackers sent messages, masquerading as ones coming from Spamhaus, to those machines, which were then amplified drastically by the servers, causing torrents of data to be aimed back at the Spamhaus computers. When Spamhaus requested aid from CloudFlare, the attackers began to focus their digital ire on the companies that provide data connections for both Spamhaus and CloudFlare. Questioned about the attacks, Sven Olaf Kamphuis, an Internet activist who said he was a spokesman for the attackers, said in an online message that, ''We are aware that this is one of the largest DDoS attacks the world had publicly seen.'' Mr. Kamphuis said Cyberbunker was retaliating against Spamhaus for ''abusing their influence.'' ''Nobody ever deputized Spamhaus to determine what goes and does not go on the Internet,'' Mr. Kamphuis said. ''They worked themselves into that position by pretending to fight spam.'' A typical denial-of-service attack tends to affect only a small number of networks. But in the case of a Domain Name System flood attack, data packets are aimed at the victim from servers all over the world. Such attacks cannot easily be stopped, experts say, because those servers cannot be shut off without halting the Internet. ''The No. 1 rule of the Internet is that it has to work,'' said Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher who years ago pointed out the inherent vulnerabilities of the Domain Name System. ''You can't stop a DNS flood by shutting down those servers because those machines have to be open and public by default. The only way to deal with this problem is to find the people doing it and arrest them.'' The heart of the problem, according to several Internet engineers, is that many large Internet service providers have not set up their networks to make sure that traffic leaving their networks is actually coming from their own users. The potential security flaw has long been known by Internet security specialists, but it has only recently been exploited in a way that threatens the Internet infrastructure. An engineer at one of the largest Internet communications firms said the attacks in recent days have been as many as five times larger than what was seen recently in attacks against major American banks. He said the attacks were not large enough to saturate the company's largest routers, but they had overwhelmed important equipment. Cyberbunker brags on its Web site that it has been a frequent target of law enforcement because of its ''many controversial customers.'' The company claims that at one point it fended off a Dutch SWAT team. ''Dutch authorities and the police have made several attempts to enter the bunker by force,'' the site said. ''None of these attempts were successful.'' "
Robbing a Gas Station: The Hacker Way,"Thieves of the future will look back on today's stick-up artists and have a good old belly laugh. Why would anyone ever rob a cashier with a gun, when all that is needed is a smartphone?  Matt Bergin, a security consultant at Core Security, discovered he could hack a cash register remotely, popping it open, by sending two digits from his smartphone to the service running on the cash register's point-of-sale system. No gun or holdup note was required. He was able to do so through a vulnerability in Xpient, which makes point-of-sale software that runs on cash drawers. ""It was extremely trivial,"" Mr. Bergin said in an interview Wednesday. He reverse-engineered Xpient's point-of-sale system, expecting that to interact with it he would have to crack a password or break through a layer of encryption. To his surprise, he encountered neither. By simply sending a two-digit code from his phone to the point-of-sale system, he discovered he could pop open the cash register remotely. Christopher Sebes, the chief executive of Xpient, said in an interview Thursday that the company had issued a patch for the vulnerability, which Xpient customers can download to their systems. Mr. Sebes noted that customers who had a Windows firewall switched on would be protected from the hack, regardless of whether they had downloaded the patch. He also noted that someone could just as easily pop open a cash register by physically hitting the ""No Sale"" button on the register itself. Increasingly, criminals are finding ways to use digital tactics for physical theft. In February, thieves stole $45 million from thousands of New York City A.T.M.'s in a few hours using a few keystrokes. It was one of the largest heists in New York City history, the authorities said, on par with the 1978 Lufthansa robbery at Kennedy Airport that inspired a scene in the 1990 film ""Goodfellas.""  "
Pentagon Expanding Cybersecurity Force to Protect Networks Against Attacks,"WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon is moving toward a major expansion of its cybersecurity force to counter increasing attacks on the nation's computer networks, as well as to expand offensive computer operations on foreign adversaries, defense officials said Sunday.  The expansion would increase the Defense Department's Cyber Command by more than 4,000 people, up from the current 900, an American official said. Defense officials acknowledged that a formidable challenge in the growth of the command would be finding, training and holding onto such a large number of qualified people. The Pentagon ''is constantly looking to recruit, train and retain world class cyberpersonnel,'' a defense official said Sunday. ''The threat is real and we need to react to it,'' said William J. Lynn III, a former deputy defense secretary who worked on the Pentagon's cybersecurity strategy. As part of the expansion, officials said the Pentagon was planning three different forces under Cyber Command: ''national mission forces'' to protect computer systems that support the nation's power grid and critical infrastructure; ''combat mission forces'' to plan and execute attacks on adversaries; and ''cyber protection forces'' to secure the Pentagon's computer systems. The move, part of a push by Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta to bolster the Pentagon's cyberoperations, was first reported on The Washington Post's Web site. In October, Mr. Panetta warned in dire terms that the United States was facing the possibility of a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor'' and was increasingly vulnerable to foreign computer hackers who could dismantle the nation's power grid, transportation system, financial network and government. He said that ''an aggressor nation'' or extremist group could cause a national catastrophe, and that he was reacting to increasing assertiveness and technological advances by the nation's adversaries, which officials identified as China, Russia, Iran and militant groups. Defense officials said that Mr. Panetta was particularly concerned about a computer attack last August on the state oil company Saudi Aramco, which infected and made useless more than 30,000 computers. In October, American intelligence officials said they were increasingly convinced that the Saudi attacks originated in Iran. They described an emerging shadow war of attacks and counterattacks already under way between the United States and Iran in cyberspace. Among American officials, suspicion has focused on the ''cybercorps'' created in 2011 by Iran's military, partly in response to American and Israeli cyberattacks on the Iranian nuclear enrichment plan at Natanz. There is no hard evidence, however, that the attacks were sanctioned by the Iranian government. The attacks emanating from Iran have inflicted only modest damage. Iran's cyberwarfare capabilities are weaker than those of China and Russia, which intelligence officials believe are the sources of a significant number of attacks on American companies and government agencies. The expansion of Cyber Command comes as the Pentagon is making cuts elsewhere, including in the size of its conventional armed forces. "
Poking Holes in Genetic Privacy,"Not so long ago, people who provided DNA in the course of research studies were told that their privacy was assured. Their DNA sequences were on publicly available Web sites, yes, but they did not include names or other obvious identifiers. These were research databases, scientists said, not like the forensic DNA banks being gathered by the F.B.I. and police departments. But geneticists nationwide have gotten a few rude awakenings, hints that research subjects in fact could sometimes be identified by their DNA alone, or even by the way their cells were using their DNA. The latest shock came in January, when a researcher at the Whitehead Institute, which is affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, managed to track down five people selected at random from a database using only their DNA, ages and the states in which they lived. And he did it in just hours. He also found relatives -- a total of close to 50 people.  This month an international group of nearly 80 researchers, patient advocates, universities and organizations like the National Institutes of Health announced that it wants to consolidate the world's databases of DNA and other genetic information, making data easier for researchers to retrieve and share. But the security and privacy of the study subjects are paramount concerns, said Dr. David Altshuler of the Broad Institute of Harvard and M.I.T., a leader of the group. ''The problems are not yet solved in any general way,'' Dr. Altshuler said. ''We want to work to solve them.'' For years now, a steady stream of research has eroded scientists' faith that DNA can be held anonymously. The first shock came in 2008, when David W. Craig, a geneticist at TGen, a research institute in Phoenix, and his colleagues imagined a theoretical problem. Suppose you are trying to learn what percentage of intravenous drug users are infected with hepatitis, and you collect DNA from discarded needles and amass it in a database to look for signs of the virus in the genetic material. Is there any way, they wondered, to find a particular person's DNA is in this soup of genes? Most researchers would have said the task was impossible, worse than looking for a needle in a haystack. But Dr. Craig and his colleagues found a way to do it, exploiting the four million or so tiny, and usually inconsequential, differences in DNA letters between one individual and another. With their method, using the combinations of hundreds of thousands of DNA markers, the researchers could find a person even if his or her DNA constituted just 0.1 percent of the total in the mix. So explosive was the finding that Dr. Craig deliberately chose to write about it only very technically. The N.I.H. understood what he had accomplished, though, and quickly responded, moving all genetic data from the studies it financed behind Internet firewalls to prevent the public or anyone not authorized from using the data and, it was hoped, to protect the identities of research subjects. But another sort of genetic data -- so-called RNA expression profiles that show patterns of gene activity -- were still public. Such data could not be used to identify people, or so it was thought. Then Eric E. Schadt of Mount Sinai School of Medicine discovered that RNA expression data could be used not only to identify someone but also to learn a great deal about that person. ''We can create a profile that reflects your weight, whether you are diabetic, how old you are,'' Dr. Schadt said. He and a colleague also were able to tell if a person is infected with viruses, like HPV or H.I.V., that change the activity of genes. Moreover, they were able to make what they called a genetic bar code that could be used to identify a person in a number of DNA databases. Then, this year, in perhaps the most disturbing exercise, Yaniv Erlich, a genetics researcher at the Whitehead Institute, used a new computational tool he had invented to identify by name five people from their DNA, which he had randomly selected from a research database containing the genes of one thousand people. Experts were startled by what Dr. Erlich had done. ''We are in what I call an awareness moment,'' said Eric D. Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health. Research subjects who share their DNA may risk a loss of not just their own privacy but also that of their children and grandchildren, who will inherit many of the same genes, said Mark B. Gerstein, a Yale professor who studies large genetic databases. Even fragments of genetic information can compromise privacy. James Watson, a discoverer of DNA's double helix shape, had his genes sequenced and made the information public -- except for one, the sequence for ApoE, a gene that has a variant linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Researchers noticed, though, that they could still figure out if Dr. Watson had that variant by examining the DNA on either side of the gene he had removed. They did not reveal whether he had it. With so many questions about the privacy and security of genetic data, researchers wonder what research subjects should be told. Leaks and identification of study subjects will never be completely avoidable, said George Church, a Harvard geneticist. And as much as investigators might like to find a way to keep genetic data secure and private, he does not think there is an exclusively technical solution. ''If you believe you can just encrypt terabytes of data or anonymize them, there will always be people who hack through that,'' Dr. Church said. He believes that people who provide genetic information should be informed that a loss of privacy is likely, rather than unlikely, and agree to provide DNA with that understanding. Other researchers say the idea is not far-fetched, and some suggest that scientists be licensed before they are given access to genetic databases, with severe penalties for those who breach privacy. ''My fear is not so much that someone will take everyone's genomes and put them on the Web,'' Dr. Gerstein said. ''It is that a graduate student in some lab somewhere will naïvely post bits of genomes on his Facebook page. The idea is that before he could get access to genomes, he would be taught he can't do that. And if he did he would lose his license.'' The amount of genetic data that has been gathered so far is minuscule compared with what will be coming in the next few years, Dr. Altshuler noted, making it important to address the problems before the data deluge makes them worse. ''We see substantial issues,'' he said. ''We want to have serious discussions now.'' "
Obama to Keep Security Agency and Cyberwarfare Under a Single Commander,"WASHINGTON -- President Obama has decided to keep the National Security Agency and the Pentagon's cyberwarfare branch under the same command despite concerns that it concentrates too much power in the hands of a single military official responsible for both surveillance and directing a growing arsenal of cyberweapons. As a practical matter, the decision means that Mr. Obama must appoint a four-star military officer to succeed Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the first person to simultaneously run the two organizations, when he retires early next year. Only a military commander can run Cyber Command, which is responsible for defending the military's computer and sensor systems and carrying out offensive computer-network attacks.  But that also means the N.S.A. will be run by someone who has spent a career in the military culture, with the mind-set that engenders. Several members of an advisory committee that submitted its report to Mr. Obama on Friday -- with what the White House said was a list of 40 recommendations -- expressed the view that the two organizations should be split, in part to assure civilian control of the N.S.A. The agency is responsible for electronic intelligence gathering and has been at the center of the revelations about government surveillance. The White House said the report would not be made public until next month, when Mr. Obama announces which of the recommendations he has embraced and which he has rejected. In a statement, Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said that Mr. Obama had decided that ''keeping the positions of N.S.A. director and Cyber Command commander together as one, dual-hatted position is the most effective approach to accomplishing both agencies' missions.'' The initial decision to unify the two was made in 2009 at the recommendation of Robert M. Gates, then the defense secretary, Ms. Hayden said, ''with the aim of unifying the leadership of the organizations responsible for signals intelligence and defending the nation in cyberspace.'' ''N.S.A. plays a unique role in supporting Cyber Command's mission,'' she continued, ''providing critical support for target access and development, including linguists, analysts, cryptanalytic capabilities and sophisticated technological infrastructure.'' One leading candidate to replace General Alexander is Vice Adm. Michael S. Rogers, now the commander of the Navy's cyberoperations. He was the director of intelligence for the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff and for the Pentagon's Pacific Command. The combined Cyber Command and the security agency's most famous joint operation so far has been ''Olympic Games,'' the cyberattacks launched against Iran's nuclear program. But the revelation of that operation in 2010, when the computer worm involved in the attack escaped from the Natanz nuclear plant and began to circulate around the world, started a debate about the degree to which the United States wants to make computer weaponry a regular part of its military arsenal. From its creation in 2009, Cyber Command has had a complicated organizational relationship within the military and intelligence community. It is not a stand-alone military command, but is subordinate to the Strategic Command, in Nebraska, which has authority over America's nuclear arsenal. But it is physically located at Fort Meade, in Maryland, alongside the National Security Agency. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel issued no official statement on the decision to retain the current structure, but senior Pentagon officials said the outcome was based on an assessment that the military's global combatant commanders rely heavily on both the security agency and Cyber Command for real-time support. In an interview in November, Mr. Hagel previewed how policy makers and commanders were approaching the question of whether to separate the N.S.A. and Cyber Command leadership -- in particular in measuring any changes against the risks to carrying out military operations around the globe. ''I listen to our combatant commanders very carefully on this, because they're probably as big a user on a day-to-day basis of the benefits of having those two commands together as anyone,'' Mr. Hagel said. ''And we charge them -- America charges them, the Congress, the president, I do -- in each of their combatant commander responsibilities, to keep their areas safe, but also keep us all safe.'' In a separate interview last month, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, echoed a similar set of priorities as he weighed his advice on the question of whether to separate the N.S.A. and Cyber Command leadership. ''My interest is in assuring that the intelligence that the National Security Agency gathers is responsive to the needs of those out in the tactical level fighting our wars,'' General Dempsey said. He said that Cyber Command and the security agency were ''actually operating in the same domain, and we rely on one set of critical I.T. architecture.'' It would be inefficient -- even financially impossible -- to fully recreate for Cyber Command the architecture that already exists within the N.S.A., he said. Also on Friday, the security agency publicly confirmed that Chris Inglis, the agency's deputy director and its highest ranking civilian, had stepped down. The move was first reported by Foreign Policy. A spokeswoman for the security agency, Vanee Vines, said that Mr. Inglis had stepped down this week and been succeeded by Fran Fleisch as the acting deputy director until a decision is made about whom his long-term successor should be. A former air force pilot and a retired brigadier general in the Air National Guard, Mr. Inglis had been serving as the N.S.A.'s deputy director since 2006. "
Saudi Web Sites Under Attack After Surveillance Accusations,"The Saudi Interior Ministry said Friday that several government Web sites have come under attack in a campaign hackers are calling #OpSaudi. Hackers who identify with the loose hacking collective Anonymous have aimed at several government Web sites, including the Saudi Ministry of Finance, General Intelligence Presidency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Directorate General of Passports, as well as sites for several major Saudi provinces, including Makkah and Jeddah.   Most of the sites are facing distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks, in which hackers flood each site with traffic until they collapse under the load. But hackers claimed to have also broken into some sites through a so-called SQL injection, in which attackers exploit a software vulnerability and enter commands that cause a database to produce its contents. In one case, the Twitter account for #AnonySaudi claimed to delete the database of a Saudi Web server. Hackers say their motive is twofold. On Twitter, some claim the #OpSaudi campaign is in retaliation for unconfirmed reports of a rape and murder in Saudi Arabia. Some Tweets include links to YouTube videos which show images of a naked body dumped on the side of a road. The attacks also followed an announcement by Matthew Rosenfield, the well-known security researcher who goes by the hacker handle Moxie Marlinspike, that Mobily, a major Saudi telecommunications company, approached him about assisting in a continuing Saudi surveillance project. In a widely circulated blog post Monday, Mr. Marlinspike said he learned that on behalf of a Saudi ""regulator,"" Mobily is working to intercept mobile app data for communication tools including Twitter and free mobile messaging apps like Viber, Line and WhatsApp that send messages over the Web. He published his e-mail correspondence with an executive at Mobily, which showed the company is developing the ability to monitor mobile data communication and already has the ability to block it. Mr. Marlinspike told Yasser D. Alruhaily, a Mobily security executive, that he declined the job for privacy reasons. Mr. Alruhaily replied, ""I know that already and I have same thoughts like you freedom and respecting privacy, actually Saudi has a big terrorist problem and they are misusing these services for spreading terrorism and contacting and spreading their cause that's why I took this and I seek your help,"" he wrote. ""If you are not interested than maybe you are on indirectly helping those who curb the freedom with their brutal activities."" Mobily spokesman denied contacting Mr. Marlinspike. ""Mobily or its employees never communicated with the author of this blog,"" the company told Reuters. ""Mobily communicates with information security companies only based on legal and lawful requirements. We never communicate with hackers. Moreover, it is not our job to spy on customers."" On Friday, the Mobily Web site was among the growing number of Saudi Web sites that #OpSaudi had taken offline.  "
Uniting for Cyberdefense,"The discussion on cyberthreats has finally gone public. For years, governments have treated damage from cyberattacks as classified information, while the private sector has kept damage secret in order not to scare off customers and investors. Recent high-profile cyberattacks such as those on The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and the U.S. Federal Reserve are only the tip of the iceberg. Cyberattacks, whether random or targeted, whether successful or not, have increased to the point that we are seeing a paradigm shift: We have become aware that transparency and shared knowledge can increase protection and strengthen security. The damage resulting from malicious cyberactivities, such as theft of personal data or intellectual property, is enormous, even if mainly economic for now. But, like any other terror attack, cyberattacks have the potential to damage critical infrastructure and to create unprecedented disasters.  Last year, Deutsche Telekom (I am the chief executive) started to disclose information about cyberattacks. To institutionalize this approach, we organized -- together with the Munich Security Conference -- a Cyber Security Summit with major German industries. The positive reception encouraged us to set up a follow-up summit in 2013. A ''neighborhood watch'' is key to success in cyberdefense. We need to establish ''single points of contact'' for rapid alerts and information exchange across all industries. A good role model for this is the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) in the information technology sector. To create additional awareness, we are developing a ''real time situation monitor'' with an actual overview on imminent cyberthreats. Sharing information while an attack is happening will allow us to update our security measures in real time. Transparency about cyberattacks has only just begun and we need to accelerate our efforts. Attackers use the advantages of combined forces. They bundle the power of hundreds of thousands of computer systems in botnets in order to carry out large-scale attacks. Why don't we take the same approach when it comes to cybersecurity? Voluntary information sharing is one element of such a collaborative effort; another could be to share the resources already in place, including expert know-how, to make our defensive efforts more powerful and efficient. Industry, for the most part, is willing to do what it takes to secure cyberspace. Other stakeholders have to do their homework as well. A concern of industry is that rules and regulations have not kept pace with the technological developments -- both in offense and defense. A set of basic and accepted rules-of-the-road protects our physical highways and traffic, and we have to have similar, internationally recognized rules for the information highway. We must define standards and functionalities in order to ensure a safe and coherent digital architecture. A good example is the German security standard for ''smart meters'' that monitor and bill power consumption. This will not be easy for the I.T. industry. In Europe, the sheer number of Internet providers makes it difficult to find a common position. Again, transparency and information sharing is essential: Every sound effort to implement such rules and standards relies on feedback about vulnerabilities, as well as data on the quantity, quality and origin of attacks. One cannot manage a problem until one can measure it. All stakeholders in the Internet ecosystem should join this ''collective cybersecurity alliance.'' Hardware and software suppliers have the same responsibility for cybersecurity as infrastructure providers, and must act on it. Once a vulnerable product has been supplied, it is almost impossible to achieve an appropriate level of security. The I.T. industry has to rethink this. Cybersecurity will become more of a consideration for consumers. But the end user -- the weakest link in cybersecurity -- must also act responsibly. Homeowners secure their property when they go out; Internet users must be as diligent in protecting digital assets. If all users kept their I.T. systems up to date, most attacks would be unsuccessful. Finally, we must accelerate innovation in cybersecurity. When the Internet was designed, security was not a priority. Today, we see constantly evolving new technologies -- such as mobile networks, smart grids or cloud computing -- and ever-increasing interconnection. This opens doors to advanced threats. Thus our defense capabilities need to be dynamic and flexible. Very often, it is the agile, creative, technology-savvy start-up companies that are best able to deal with new cyberthreats. We need to work with them and equip them with appropriate venture capital. In the long run, we simply cannot afford to lag behind the bad guys. To be sure, we will not erase cyberattacks, much as we are unable to erase crime. But we must at least aim to control and contain it, lest we find ourselves on the losing end of a battle that threatens our prosperity, public safety and ultimately national security. René Obermann is the chief executive officer of Deutsche Telekom. "
Google Adds Malware Statistics to Transparency Report,"In an effort to draw awareness to just how unsafe the Internet has become, Google will be adding statistics about malware to its transparency report. Google's transparency report currently documents criminal requests and national security requests from government's worldwide, though it does not include requests from the federal government's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court regarding Google's foreign users.  Since that court made headlines this month, Google and other tech companies have been trying to contain the public relations crisis that has resulted from revelations that they have been aiding government surveillance efforts when ordered to by the court. Google has since filed a legal motion asking the government to relax its gag order and allow the company to disclose the number of FISA requests it receives. At the same time, Google said on Monday it would also be expanding its transparency report to include new numbers around malware and phishing attacks on the Internet. In 2006, Google started searching for, and flagging, suspect Web sites for its users. It is now flagging some 10,000 sites a day. The company said its transparency report would now document how many people see its security warnings each week, where malicious sites were hosted around the world (and by which Internet Service Providers), how long it took for Web masters to clean up their sites, and- somewhat depressingly- how quickly Web sites got reinfected after they were scrubbed of malware. ""We want to make as much information available about the state of the Web as we see it, so everyone else cares about this problem,"" Niels Provos, a ""distinguished engineer"" at Google, one of the highest technical titles bestowed at the company, said in an interview Monday. ""It's a prevalent problem. It's not rare."" Mr. Provos said his team had been working on gathering relevant statistics for the last six months and that Google would begin updating its transparency report weekly. ""By putting this out there, we want to educate Web masters that this is very real, that the danger of you getting infected is very large,"" Mr. Provos said.  "
Questions of Trust And Web Security,"Q. What does it mean when a Web site says its security certificate isn't trusted? I get this message from Google Chrome sometimes -- is my computer in danger?  A. Most sites that transmit personal data (like credit card numbers) between its server and your computer's Web browser use encryption to keep the information secure. A legitimate e-commerce site presents your Web browser with a digital ''security certificate'' to verify its identity and distinguish it from a site created by criminals to steal your data. A third-party company, like DigiCert or GeoTrust -- one that the browser recognizes as a certificate authority -- issues the certificate and confirms the Web site's security credentials. (The system is not infallible, though, as certificate authority companies have been hacked and fraudulent certificates created.) When Google Chrome gives you a message about a security certificate that it does not trust, it is because the third-party company that issued that site's certificate is not one that Chrome recognizes as a legitimate authority. This could be because the Web site got its certificate from a lesser-known authority or because the security certificate is fraudulent. If you know the company behind the site in question and are confident of your security, you can proceed, but if you are unsure of the site you are visiting, click the ''Back to safety'' button to bail out.

Hackers Hit Servers at The Washington Post for a 3rd Time,"Hackers breached The Washington Post's computer servers for the third time in three years, the newspaper reported late Wednesday. This time hackers gained access to employee user names and passwords, The Post reported, but it said there was no evidence they obtained subscriber information, like credit cards or home addresses. The paper also said there was no sign the hackers gained access to its publishing system, emails or other personal information of employees, such as their Social Security numbers.  The company said it suspected that Chinese hackers were behind the current raid. Post officials said that they were informed of the breach on Wednesday by Mandiant, its web security contractor, and that it lasted less than a week. ''This is an ongoing investigation, but we believe it was a few days at most,'' said Kris Coratti, a Post spokeswoman. Ms. Coratti did not release a press statement or take questions about the hack, but instead referred reporters to an article in The Post for further information. The Post system was compromised previously last August, when the Syrian Electronic Army, a hacker collective that supports President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, briefly directed some readers of the paper's website to a site that lauded President Assad and condemned the country's rebels. In 2011, The Post, as well as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, were subject to sophisticated attacks thought to have originated in China. It was believed then that Chinese hackers were looking for sources on stories about the country. At the time, The Post declined to release details of how much information the intruders received, but that first breach was thought to be extensive. On Wednesday, the paper emphasized the brevity of the most recent attack. But at the same time, it asked employees to change their user names and passwords. ''Although company passwords are stored in encrypted form,'' said the newspaper's article on the episode, ''hackers in some cases have shown the ability to decode such information.'' "
Other Agencies Clamor for Data N.S.A. Compiles,"WASHINGTON -- The National Security Agency's dominant role as the nation's spy warehouse has spurred frequent tensions and turf fights with other federal intelligence agencies that want to use its surveillance tools for their own investigations, officials say. Agencies working to curb drug trafficking, cyberattacks, money laundering, counterfeiting and even copyright infringement complain that their attempts to exploit the security agency's vast resources have often been turned down because their own investigations are not considered a high enough priority, current and former government officials say. Intelligence officials say they have been careful to limit the use of the security agency's troves of data and eavesdropping spyware for fear they could be misused in ways that violate Americans' privacy rights. The recent disclosures of agency activities by its former contractor Edward J. Snowden have led to widespread criticism that its surveillance operations go too far and have prompted lawmakers in Washington to talk of reining them in. But out of public view, the intelligence community has been agitated in recent years for the opposite reason: frustrated officials outside the security agency say the spy tools are not used widely enough.  ''It's a very common complaint about N.S.A.,'' said Timothy H. Edgar, a former senior intelligence official at the White House and at the office of the director of national intelligence. ''They collect all this information, but it's difficult for the other agencies to get access to what they want.'' ''The other agencies feel they should be bigger players,'' said Mr. Edgar, who heard many of the disputes before leaving government this year to become a visiting fellow at Brown University. ''They view the N.S.A. -- incorrectly, I think -- as this big pot of data that they could go get if they were just able to pry it out of them.'' Smaller intelligence units within the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security have sometimes been given access to the security agency's surveillance tools for particular cases, intelligence officials say. But more often, their requests have been rejected because the links to terrorism or foreign intelligence, usually required by law or policy, are considered tenuous. Officials at some agencies see another motive -- protecting the security agency's turf -- and have grown resentful over what they see as a second-tier status that has undermined their own investigations into security matters. At the drug agency, for example, officials complained that they were blocked from using the security agency's surveillance tools for several drug-trafficking cases in Latin America, which they said might be connected to financing terrorist groups in the Middle East and elsewhere. At the Homeland Security Department, officials have repeatedly sought to use the security agency's Internet and telephone databases and other resources to trace cyberattacks on American targets that are believed to have stemmed from China, Russia and Eastern Europe, according to officials. They have often been rebuffed. Officials at the other agencies, speaking only on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the tensions, say the National Security Agency's reluctance to allow access to data has been particularly frustrating because of post-Sept. 11 measures that were intended to encourage information-sharing among federal agencies. In fact, a change made in 2008 in the executive order governing intelligence was intended to make it easier for the security agency to share surveillance information with other agencies if it was considered ''relevant'' to their own investigations. It has often been left to the national intelligence director's office to referee the frequent disputes over how and when the security agency's spy tools can be used. The director's office declined to comment for this article. Typically, the agencies request that the N.S.A. target individuals or groups for surveillance, search its databases for information about them, or share raw intelligence, rather than edited summaries, with them. If those under scrutiny are Americans, approval from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is required. The security agency, whose mission is to spy overseas, and the F.B.I., its main partner in surveillance operations, dominate the process as the Justice Department's main ''customers'' in seeking warrants from the intelligence court, with nearly 1,800 approved by the court last year. In a statement, the security agency said that it ''works closely with all intelligence community partners, and embeds liaison officers and other personnel at those agencies for the express purpose of ensuring N.S.A. is meeting their requirements and providing support to their missions.'' The security agency's spy tools are attractive to other agencies for many reasons. Unlike traditional, narrowly tailored search warrants, those granted by the intelligence court often allow searches through records and data that are vast in scope. The standard of evidence needed to acquire them may be lower than in other courts, and the government may not be required to disclose for years, if ever, that someone was the focus of secret surveillance operations. Decisions on using the security agency's powers rest on many complicated variables, including a link to terrorism or ''foreign intelligence,'' the type of surveillance or data collection that is being conducted, the involvement of American targets, and the priority of the issue. ''Every agency wants to think that their mission has to be the highest priority,'' said a former senior White House intelligence official involved in recent turf issues. Other intelligence shops usually have quick access to N.S.A. tools and data on pressing matters of national security, like investigating a terrorism threat, planning battlefield operations or providing security for a presidential trip, officials say. But the conflicts arise during longer-term investigations with unclear foreign connections. In pressing for greater access, a number of smaller agencies maintain that their cases involve legitimate national security threats and could be helped significantly by the N.S.A.'s ability to trace e-mails and Internet activity or other tools. Drug agency officials, for instance, have sought a higher place for global drug trafficking on the intelligence community's classified list of surveillance priorities, according to two officials. Dawn Dearden, a drug agency spokeswoman, said it was comfortable allowing the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. to take the lead in seeking surveillance warrants. ''We don't have the authority, and we don't want it, and that comes from the top down,'' she said. But privately, intelligence officials at the drug agency and elsewhere have complained that they feel shut out of the process by the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. from start to finish, with little input on what groups are targeted with surveillance and only sporadic access to the classified material that is ultimately collected. Sometimes, security agency and bureau officials accuse the smaller agencies of exaggerating links to national security threats in their own cases when pushing for access to the security agency's surveillance capabilities. Officials from the other agencies say that if a link to national security is considered legitimate, the F.B.I. will at times simply take over the case itself and work it with the N.S.A. In one such case, the bureau took control of a Secret Service investigation after a hacker was linked to a foreign government, one law enforcement official said. Similarly, the bureau became more interested in investigating smuggled cigarettes as a means of financing terrorist groups after the case was developed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Mr. Edgar said officials in the national intelligence director's office occasionally allow other agencies a role in identifying surveillance targets and seeing the results when it is relevant to their own inquiries. But more often, he acknowledged, the office has come down on the side of keeping the process held to an ''exclusive club'' at the N.S.A., the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, with help from the Central Intelligence Agency on foreign issues. Officials in the national intelligence director's office worry about opening the surveillance too widely beyond the security agency and the F.B.I. for fear of abuse, Mr. Edgar said. The two intelligence giants have been ''burned'' by past wiretapping controversies and know the political consequences if they venture too far afield, he added. ''I would have been very uncomfortable if we had let these other agencies get access to the raw N.S.A. data,'' he said. As furious as the public criticism of the security agency's programs has been in the two months since Mr. Snowden's disclosures, ''it could have been much, much worse, if we had let these other agencies loose and we had real abuses,'' Mr. Edgar said. ''That was the nightmare scenario we were worried about, and that hasn't happened.'' "
Beijing Opposes U.S. Rule on Technology Imports,"BEIJING -- China expressed ''resolute opposition'' and ''strong dissatisfaction'' with a new U.S. cyberespionage rule limiting imports of Chinese-made information technology products, the state media reported over the weekend.  The remarks underscore growing tension between the world's top two economies after the United States accused China of backing a string of hacking attacks on U.S. companies and government agencies. China says that the accusation lacks proof and that it is also a victim of hacking attacks, more than half of which originate in the United States. The new provision, tucked into a funding bill signed into law in Washington on Thursday, requires NASA, as well as the U.S. Justice and Commerce Departments, to seek approval from national law enforcement officials before buying information technology systems from China. The United States imports about $129 billion worth of ''advanced technology products'' from China, according to a May 2012 report by the U.S. Congressional Research Service. The Chinese state media, including Xinhua, China Daily and People's Daily, quoted a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce on Saturday as saying the U.S. bill ''sends a very wrong signal.'' ''This will directly impact partnerships of Chinese enterprises and American business as they conduct regular trade,'' said Shen Danyang, the Commerce Ministry spokesman. ''This abuse of so-called national security measures is unfair to Chinese enterprises, and extends the discriminatory practice of presumption of guilt,'' the article in the official People's Daily said, quoting Mr. Shen. ''This severely damages mutual trust between the U.S. and China.'' The United States should eliminate the law, Mr. Shen said. The technology security lawyer Stewart Baker wrote in a blog post last week that China could claim that the United States was violating World Trade Organization rules. However, because Beijing has not signed a W.T.O. agreement setting international rules for government procurement, it may not be successful in its challenge, Mr. Baker said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei urged the United States at a news conference to abandon the law. ''This bill uses Internet security as an excuse to take discriminatory steps against Chinese companies,'' he said. "
Arrest Made In Attack That Slowed The Internet,"Dutch authorities say police officials in Spain have arrested a man believed to be connected to an online attack on a spam-fighting site that snarled the Internet last month. While the authorities did not give the full name of the man in a statement published on a Dutch government Web site, they identified him as ''S.K.'' A source close to the investigation, who was not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed that the arrested man was Sven Olaf Kamphuis, a 35-year-old Dutch man who has been the spokesman of a group that was protesting a European antispam group's tactics. Spanish police arrested the man on Thursday at his home in Barcelona, at the request of the Dutch police, and seized his computers and mobile phones. He is expected to be sent to the Netherlands. Wim de Bruin, a spokesman for Dutch national prosecutor's office, said ''S.K.'' was suspected of playing a role in a wave of attacks last month.  His arrest came after an investigation by authorities in the Netherlands and other European countries into Mr. Kamphuis's involvement in one of the largest attacks on the Internet. Mr. Kamphuis has been suspected of starting a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack against Spamhaus, the antispam group. Such attacks are a criminal offense under Dutch law. Mr. Kamphuis calls himself the ''minister of telecommunications and foreign affairs for the Republic of CyberBunker.'' But many consider him to be the Prince of Spam. He runs CB3ROB, an Internet service provider, and CyberBunker, a Web hosting company that in the past has hosted sites like WikiLeaks and the Pirate Bay, a site accused of abetting digital content piracy. Antispam groups say they believe CyberBunker acts as a conduit for vast amounts of spam. Last month, Spamhaus, an antispam group based in Geneva, added CyberBunker to its blacklist, which is used by major e-mail providers to block spam. In the days and weeks after the blacklisting, Spamhaus was targeted with an DDoS attack, which flooded the site with traffic until it fell offline. After Spamhaus hired a Silicon Valley Internet security firm, CloudFlare, to defend against the attack, the attackers turned their ire on CloudFlare. When efforts to bring down CloudFlare were unsuccessful, the attackers hit back with a far more powerful strike that exploited the Internet's core infrastructure, called the Domain Name System, or D.N.S. Their attack quickly reached previously unknown magnitudes, growing to a data stream of 300 billion bits per second, which resulted in slowing Internet traffic for millions of Internet users around the world. Mr. Kamphuis has denied his role in the attack and said he was only a spokesman for Stophaus, a loose organization set up to take down Spamhaus. Asked about his involvement in the attacks last month, Mr. Kamphuis told The New York Times, ''We are aware that this is one of the largest DDoS attacks the world has seen so far, yes.'' But through his Facebook page, Mr. Kamphuis has actively called on hackers to take Spamhaus offline. ''Yo anons, we could use a little help in shutting down illegal slander and blackmail censorship project 'spamhaus.org,' which thinks it can dictate its views on what should and should not be on the Internet,'' he said on Facebook on March 23. Dutch prosecutors singled out Mr. Kamphuis because of his vocal role. Greenhost, a Dutch Internet hosting service, said in a blog post that it had found CB3ROB's digital fingerprints while studying the attack traffic directed at Spamhaus. Mr. Kamphuis's arrest in Barcelona was made through the European Union's judicial collaboration unit, Eurojust. An anonymous statement was posted to Pastebin, a Web forum for hackers, on Friday, proclaiming Mr. Kamphuis's innocence and threatening another round of attacks if he is not released. ''We demand u to release Sven or we will indeed start the biggest attack u humans have ever experienced toward The Internet, and yourself,'' the hacker wrote. "
China Blasts Hacking Claim By Pentagon,"HONG KONG -- China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday criticized a Pentagon report that explicitly accused China's military of staging attacks on the computer systems of the American government and military contractors.  ''China has repeatedly said that we resolutely oppose all forms of hacker attacks,'' said a ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying. ''We're willing to carry out an even-tempered and constructive dialogue with the U.S. on the issue of Internet security. But we are firmly opposed to any groundless accusations and speculations, since they will only damage the cooperation efforts and atmosphere between the two sides to strengthen dialogue and cooperation.'' In its annual report to Congress on Chinese military capabilities, which was released on Monday, the Pentagon said that last year, ''numerous computer systems around the world, including those owned by the U.S. government, continued to be targeted for intrusions, some of which appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military.'' In a telephone interview, a retired People's Liberation Army major general, Xu Guangyu, who is now a senior consultant at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association in Beijing, voiced sentiments similar to that of Ms. Hua. He said that China was the victim, not perpetrator, of Internet hacking. ''From the president down, people in the United States have leveled accusations, and China has already many times answered those accusations,'' General Xu said. ''Everyone knows that on the Internet, the United States wields absolute advantage and control.'' He called for the United States to take the lead on international talks to set rules on cyberespionage. ''It should be the United States that sets an example of sitting down for discussions on an equal footing, and setting better rules to reduce the damage, because it's the United States that has absolute dominance,'' he said. "
Some in Congress Grow More Wary of Selling Sprint to SoftBank of Japan,"11:09 p.m. | Updated Congressional concern over the proposed takeover of Sprint Nextel by SoftBank of Japan on national security grounds grew on Thursday as Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York asked government regulators to carefully review the Asian company's ties to Chinese telecommunications equipment makers. In a letter to the Treasury Department and the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday, Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, urged the two to carefully consider the SoftBank deal in the wake of widespread attacks by Chinese hackers.  ''The protection of our critical infrastructure is a topic of intense legislative scrutiny,'' the Democratic senator from New York wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by a reporter for the The New York Times. He asked the two agencies to take a close look ''to ensure that our nation's security is not placed at risk.'' Mr. Schumer is the latest senior lawmaker in Washington to express wariness over the deal because of SoftBank's relationships with Chinese telecommunications equipment makers like Huawei and ZTE. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, wrote a separate letter to the F.C.C.'s acting chairwoman, Mignon L. Clyburn, on Thursday, asking the agency to carefully review the proposal. The letters come as SoftBank cleared another regulatory hurdle on Thursday. A California state regulator approved the proposed takeover, joining 22 other states and the District of Columbia. Now the Japanese firm needs only clearance from the F.C.C. and a government panel that reviews foreign investments in the country that is led by the Treasury Department. Decisions from both agencies are expected soon. SoftBank, which announced its agreement to buy a majority stake in Sprint last October, is also competing against Dish Network, which is trying to derail the deal with a rival $25.5 billion takeover bid. Over the last several months, both SoftBank and Sprint have tried to assuage concerns over national security. The two assured Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, that they would remove Huawei equipment from their United States network earlier this year. Mr. Rogers, has offered cautious praise for the pledge. ''I am pleased with their mitigation plans, but will continue to look for opportunities to improve the government's existing authorities to thoroughly review all the national security aspects of proposed transactions,'' he said in March. The two companies have also agreed to give the federal government veto power over one of SoftBank's representatives on the new Sprint board. That person would be charged with ensuring the company's compliance on network security. Dish Network has made national security one of its chief weapons against SoftBank, using a media campaign in Washington that tries to play on fears about a foreign company taking control of a major American telecommunications firm. A spokesman for SoftBank argued that while it had pledged to remove Huawei equipment from Clearwire's systems, Dish had not made a similar commitment. ''SoftBank's proposal improves U.S. national security because only SoftBank has committed to remove equipment already located inside a U.S. network that the government has national security concerns about,'' the spokesman said in a statement. ''Dish has made no such commitment to remove this network equipment and to do so would require Dish to further increase the amount of debt it will need to complete any transaction.'' Other countries already own significant stakes in American wireless networks: Vodafone of Britain owns 45 percent of Verizon Wireless, the country's biggest cellphone service provider, while Deutsche Telekom of Germany owns a majority stake in T-Mobile US. But SoftBank has faced questions about its connections to Huawei and ZTE shortly after its bid. The Japanese firm uses equipment from both companies in its systems outside the United States, primarily through a joint venture. And Clearwire, a wireless network operator of which Sprint is seeking full control, uses some Huawei products in parts of its network. Lawmakers have argued that both companies are closely tied to the Chinese government, and that allowing them entry to into critical national infrastructure could leave the country vulnerable to online attacks on vital assets like power grids and dams. ''In light of these facts, I am concerned that critical parts of Sprint's future network may also become dependent on unsecure Chinese equipment and vulnerable to interference. With Sprint's ultimate control in foreign hands, there are significant questions as to whether the United States would have sufficient influence and oversight to mitigate these concerns,'' Mr. Schumer said in a letter to the F.C.C. and the Treasury. ''The blatant attempt to politicize'' the approval process ''by Dish and a senior member of the Senate banking committee is inappropriate and threatens to discourage important foreign investment in the United States,'' the SoftBank spokesman said. Mr. Schumer replied in a statement: ''There's nothing political about expressing concerns over national security.'' Mr. Schumer has sought to block takeovers in the past on national security grounds. He fought the proposed sale of six American ports to DP World, a company based in Dubai, arguing that the deal would endanger national security. DP World eventually agreed to sell the American ports assets to an arm of the American International Group. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
N.S.A. Leaks Make Plan For Cyberdefense Unlikely,"WASHINGTON -- Even while rapidly expanding its electronic surveillance around the world, the National Security Agency has lobbied inside the government to deploy the equivalent of a ''Star Wars'' defense for America's computer networks, designed to intercept cyberattacks before they could cripple power plants, banks or financial markets. But administration officials say the plan, championed by Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency and head of the Pentagon's Cyber Command, has virtually no chance of moving forward given the backlash against the N.S.A. over the recent disclosures about its surveillance programs. Senior agency officials concede that much of the technology needed to filter malicious software, known as malware, by searching incoming messages for signs of programs designed to steal data, or attack banks or energy firms, is strikingly similar to the technology the N.S.A. already uses for surveillance.  ''The plan was always a little vague, at least as Keith described it, but today it may be Snowden's biggest single victim,'' one senior intelligence official said recently, referring to Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who released documents revealing details of many of the agency's surveillance programs. ''Whatever trust was there is now gone,'' the official added. ''I mean, who would believe the N.S.A. when it insists it is blocking Chinese attacks but not using the same technology to read your e-mail?'' On Friday, the N.S.A. reported for the first time that it ''touches about 1.6 percent'' of all the traffic carried on the Internet each day. In a statement, it said it closely examines only a tiny fraction of that information. But General Alexander's plan would put the agency, or Internet-service providers acting on its behalf, in the position of examining a far larger percentage of the world's information flows. Under this proposal, the government would latch into the giant ''data pipes'' that feed the largest Internet service providers in the United States, companies like A.T.&T. and Verizon. The huge volume of traffic that runs through those pipes, particularly e-mails, would be scanned for signs of anything from computer servers known for attacks on the United States or for stealing information from American companies. Other ''metadata'' would be inspected for evidence of malicious software. ''It's defense at network speed,'' General Alexander told a Washington security-research group recently, according to participants. ''Because you have only milliseconds.'' This summer, the N.S.A. has begun assembling scores of new cyber ''offense'' and ''defense'' teams, the agency's most concrete step toward preparing the Pentagon and intelligence agencies for a new era of computer conflict. Erecting a national cyberdefense is a key element of that plan. At an interagency meeting that discussed the flood of cyberattacks directed daily at American networks, from Chinese efforts to steal corporate secrets to Iranian efforts to cripple financial institutions, General Alexander said, ''I can't defend the country until I'm into all the networks,'' according to other officials who were present. The appeal of such a program is its seeming simplicity: The worst malware could be blocked before it reaches companies, universities or individual users, many of whom may be using outdated virus protections, or none at all. Normal commercial virus programs are always running days, or weeks, behind the latest attacks -- and the protection depends on users' loading the latest versions on their computers. The government has been testing a model for a national defense against cyberattack with major defense contractors including Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon. Early results were disappointing, but participants in the program -- the specific details of which are heavily classified -- say they are getting significantly improved results. Each company in the defense industrial base program now shares data on the kinds of attacks it is seeing, anonymously, with other participating companies. But for the N.S.A., which is building a target list of servers used by the most aggressive cyberattackers, monitoring all Internet traffic would also be an intelligence bonanza. It would give it a real-time way to watch computer servers around the world, and focus more quickly on those it suspects are the breeding ground for governments or private hackers preparing attacks. Even before the Snowden revelations, General Alexander had encountered opposition. Top officials of the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for domestic defense of the Internet, complained that N.S.A. monitoring would overly militarize America's approach to defending the Internet, rather than making sure users took the primary responsibility for protecting their systems. The deputy secretary of defense, Ashton B. Carter, described in speeches over the past year an alternative vision in which the government would step in to defend America's networks only as a last line of defense. He compares the Pentagon's proper role in defending cyberattacks to its ''Noble Eagle'' operation, in which it intercepts aircraft that appear threatening only after efforts by the airlines to identify the passengers and by the Transportation Safety Administration to search passengers and luggage have failed. It appears unlikely that, with the administration divided, and faced with a backlash against the N.S.A. in Congress, any proposal for a formal plan for national cyberdefense will be submitted soon. Members of the Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate said that they were only vaguely aware of General Alexander's plan, but that it would almost certainly require Congressional approval. That is a fight the White House is not interested in having while it struggles to get a much more modest cybersecurity bill through Congress after years of arguments over privacy concerns and corporate America's fears that Washington will dictate how companies protect data and how much they must spend on new defenses. The bill failed last year, and passage this year appears in doubt. Before the Snowden revelations, General Alexander's idea appeared to be gaining some ground because of concerns over the cyber-enabled Chinese theft of critical corporate secrets, including some designs for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Internal intelligence reports, based on N.S.A. analysis, attributed an attack on American banks to Iran's cybercorps, a unit of the Revolutionary Guards. ''After the Iranian attacks, we were looking at these ideas pretty hard,'' said a recently departed senior official in the Obama national security team, who like other officials declined to be identified because of the sensitivities of the government's discussions about building Internet defenses. But this summer, the mood in Congress has changed. The White House only narrowly avoided a House vote to cut off the collection of metadata about telephone calls in the country. Suddenly a national debate emerged; along the way the N.S.A. admitted that until 2011 it had collected about 1 percent of all e-mails in the United States, until the program was canceled after being judged ineffective. ''Cyberissues usually change so rapidly because of the advance of technology,'' said Peter D. Feaver, a Duke University professor who worked in the National Security Council in the George W. Bush administration. ''But the biggest change in the last year has been political: Public skepticism about U.S. cyberoperations is dramatically higher today, and it could result in political constraints that were off the table even a year ago.'' "
Fact Finder to European Court Backs Google in a Spanish Privacy Battle,"BERLIN -- In a victory for Google, the European Union's highest court received a recommendation on Tuesday to strike down a Spanish regulator's demand that the search engine grant citizens a broad digital ''right to be forgotten,'' including the ability to delete arrest records and other negative publicity from Google's online search results. An expert opinion requested by the European Court of Justice, which is based in Luxembourg, recommended that Google not be required to expunge all links to a 15-year-old legal notice published in a Barcelona newspaper documenting a Spanish man's failure to pay back taxes.  The recommendation of the court's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who acted as an official fact finder for the panel, could inform the debate in the European Parliament over updating Europe's 1995 data protection law, which was adopted at the dawn of the Internet broadband era. A proposal before the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, the European Union's upper legislative chamber, would give residents of the 27-nation bloc broader control over the display of personal information, including the digital ''right to be forgotten.'' Mr. Jaaskinen concluded that because Google merely aggregated information on the Web and was not a ''controller'' of information, it was not the legal entity that must comply with the provision of the law in question. In addition, Mr. Jaaskinen said the 1995 law guaranteed a right to be forgotten only in cases where information was incomplete or inaccurate, which was not at issue in the Spanish case. Wishing to eliminate embarrassing information is not reason enough to redact public records via Google, the court-appointed expert concluded. The 1995 law, the court recommendation said, ''does not entitle a person to restrict or terminate dissemination of personal data that he considers to be harmful or contrary to his interests.'' The case before the European court involved a Spaniard, Mario Costeja, who wanted Google to eliminate all links to a 1998 legal notice in a Barcelona newspaper, La Vanguardia, with details of a government auction of his property for failure to pay back taxes. One of Spain's top courts in Madrid, the Audiencia Nacional, asked the European court last year for guidance on how to apply the 1995 law. The Court of Justice follows expert recommendations like the one announced Tuesday in about three-quarters of cases. A court ruling, which will give guidance to the Spanish high court, is expected this year. William Echikson, who oversees Google's freedom-of-expression activities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, welcomed the advocate general's recommendation. ''This is a good opinion for free expression,'' Mr. Echikson said. ''We're glad to see it supports our long-held view that requiring search engines to suppress legitimate and legal information would amount to censorship.'' Javier Aparicio, a privacy lawyer with Cuatrecasas Goncalves Pereira in Madrid, said the court's recommendation would compel the Spanish data regulator, the Spanish Data Protection Agency, to end its practice of trying to compel Google to redact its own search results to suit the desires of Spanish citizens. The Spanish regulator said in a statement that it noted the advocate general's opinion, but declined to comment on the recommendations before the European court's decision. The agency said its policy of requesting deletions on behalf of Spanish citizens was not meant to squelch free expression or alter the historical record. Deletions were requested of Google only in cases where information was ''obsolete, lacked any relevance or public interest, and where widespread dissemination would lead to the harm of the applicant,'' the statement said. Spain had been particularly aggressive in enforcing parts of the 1995 law's prohibition against storing data on criminal and administrative infractions of individuals. In the last five years, the regulator has filed 180 requests with Google on behalf of Spanish citizens seeking the deletion of links to criminal convictions, administrative sanctions, involvement in child custody disputes and arrests where charges were dropped. Google has consistently refused the requests. Spanish law gives individuals a broad right to limit the ''indiscriminate'' dissemination of personal data, even when the original publication was legitimate, if the information ''no longer has relevance or public interest,'' according to a statement by the regulator, which is based in Madrid. Google has challenged the requests in Spanish court, arguing that it provides digital links to information only already in the Spanish public domain. Google also has said that the 1995 European law's exemption of ''platforms'' included Web services like the Google search engine, which is the market leader in Spain. "
Apps to Protect Your Array of Passwords,"We all know that we need to use strong passwords on Web sites. In fact, a different password for every site you frequent is wise. Good Web security hygiene creates two problems, however. First, you have to remember all those different passwords. Second, if you lose your smartphone, your many passwords may be at risk. But there are various password manager apps meant to solve those problems. The best-known password manager app is 1Password by AgileBits. This app keeps your many Web site passwords, for your bank and so on, safely locked up. It also can keep track of other data like passport details, addresses and more.  The app has a plain yet attractive interface that makes using it a breeze, because its various icons and controls are obvious at one glance. Tapping the ''+'' icon brings up a menu that offers you many data categories, like bank account numbers, e-mail details and wireless router passwords. You simply select the appropriate category and enter as much data in the boxes on the next page as you prefer. All your entries are then listed in the main app, and you can group them into folders if you want to keep work and home data separate. 1Password also has a secure browser built into it. It allows you to surf to your bank's Web site, in one typical case, where it will automatically enter your passwords for you or enter credit card details into shopping sites. If you think your passwords are too weak, 1Password has an automatic strong password generator that will randomly put together a complex password for you. These may be harder to remember than your usual passwords but, of course, the app remembers them for you. This app excels in security. There's a master password that protects your data, and data stored inside the app is encrypted -- which makes it safe even if someone steals your device. Its main downside is the price: It's $18 on iOS. There is a free Android version, but it's much simpler and you can't enter new data. LastPass is an alternative password and personal data manager available on iOS and Android. It also stores Web site passwords, credit card information and more behind a master password. It's also designed with simplicity in mind: there's no getting lost in overly complex menus. Although it's simpler than 1Password, it still has some nice features. It can upload photos or videos to ''secure notes'' that you store inside the app, so you can keep snippets of text or media private. It's similar to 1Password in use and quality. But there is one issue: While the app is free, to make the most of all its powers, like automatically filling in details on Web sites, you have to pay a subscription of $12 a year. A great alternative to these two, on iOS only, is the $6 app oneSafe. This app has cuter graphics than its rivals and it offers most of the same features. It stores passwords, credit card data and personal documents, and it locks them up securely, so if you lose your device, your data is safe. Its great design makes it easy to use, and it has a couple of nice extras. For example, if you prefer not to use a secure ''master'' password to access the app, you can use a pattern lock access -- where you swipe a unique pattern on the screen with your finger. It also can automatically alert you if someone tries to access your data. A rough equivalent to oneSafe is Keeper. It's popular, and though it looks different from oneSafe, it definitely has an emphasis on ease of use through a simple design. Like 1Password and LastPass, Keeper can automatically fill in Web site logins and card data for you.

"Russian Bloggers Welcome Snowden With Jokes, Praise and Job Offers","Updated, Friday, 11:32 a.m. When the former United States intelligence analyst Edward J. Snowden was finally allowed to leave his limbo in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on Thursday with a permit granting him political asylum in Russia, Russian bloggers, activists, entrepreneurs and journalists posted messages on social networks welcoming him to his new home. The messages mixed praise for his courage in leaking details of the National Security Agency's vast surveillance programs with sardonic asides about his choice to live in a country where life can be nasty, brutish and short for whistle-blowers and democracy activists. Since Mr. Snowden has just started studying Russian, The Lede has translated a selection of the welcome messages into English.  Mark Feygin, a Russian lawyer who defended three members of the activist collective Pussy Riot jailed for a political stunt, wrote on Twitter: ""Snowden doesn't quite understand that his acceptance of Russian asylum is the same as his agreeing to receive his inheritance from a Nigerian lawyer by e-mail.""  Pavel Durov, the founder of the most prominent Russian social network, VKontakte, offered Mr. Snowden immediate employment in data security: Today Edward Snowden - the man that exposed the crimes of the U.S. intelligence agencies against citizens across the globe - received temporary asylum in Russia. At such moments, one feels proud of our country and sadness over U.S. policy - a country that has betrayed the principles that it was once built upon. We invite Edward to St. Petersburg and will be thrilled if he decides to join our stellar team of programmers at VKontakte. At the end of the day, there is no European Internet company more popular than VK. I think Edward might be interested in protecting the personal data of our millions of users. Vladimir Varfolomeyev, a host at the radio station Ekho Moskvy, said: ""The Russian Federation took the correct decision on Snowden. We cannot give him to the U.S. However, the asylum seeker picked a very odd place of refuge."" The Russian news site Sputnik & Pogrom joked, ""For crimes against the American government, a U.S. court sentenced Snowden to the highest form of punishment - life in Russia."" In a series of Twitter updates, the ecological activist Yevgenia Chirikova wrote: I'm happy for Snowden. If he returns to the U.S., torture and death await him. Russia is most certainly better - a huge country, he'll find somewhere to go.  Snowden can be saved not by the Russian government, but by its vastness. Lots of people have saved themselves that way. If Snowden doesn't want to be a toy in someone else's game, he will lose himself in the endless Russian countryside. God give him strength! The journalist Maxim Shevchenko suggested that Mr. Snowden, like the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, could soon be given his own talk show on Russia Today, the Kremlin-owned network known for its consistent criticism of the United States government. The Gruppa Voina Twitter feed, run by Pyotr Verzilov, the husband of the jailed Pussy Riot activist Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, seconded a comment from a blogger who wrote, ""Poor Snowden - the guy thinks he's free.""

Daily Report: Internet Giants Push to Improve Secrecy,"When Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive, recently announced the company's biggest security overhaul in more than a decade, she did not exactly receive a standing ovation, Nicole Perlroth and Vindu Goel report.  Ordinary users asked Ms. Mayer why Yahoo was not doing more. Privacy activists were more blunt. ""Even after today's announcement, Yahoo still lags far behind Google on web security,"" said Christopher Soghoian, a technology analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. For big Internet outfits, it is no longer enough to have a fast-loading smartphone app or cool messaging service. In the era of Edward J. Snowden and his revelations of mass government surveillance, companies are competing to show users how well their data is protected from prying eyes, with billions of dollars in revenue hanging in the balance. On Thursday, Microsoft will be the latest technology company to announce plans to shield its services from outside surveillance. It is in the process of adding state-of-the-art encryption features to various consumer services and internally at its data centers. Read more »  "
Tech Giants Brace for More Scrutiny From Regulators,"Eduardo Porter, whose Economic Scene column normally appears on this page, is off. SAN FRANCISCO -- Silicon Valley lobbied hard in Washington in 2012, and despite some friction with regulators, fared fairly well. In 2013, though, government scrutiny is likely to grow. And with this scrutiny will come even greater efforts by the tech industry to press its case in the nation's capital and overseas. In 2012, among other victories, the industry staved off calls for federal consumer privacy legislation and successfully pushed for a revamp of an obscure law that had placed strict privacy protections on Americans' video rental records. It also helped achieve a stalemate on a proposed global effort to let Web users limit behavioral tracking online, using Do Not Track browser settings. But this year is likely to put that issue in the spotlight again, and bring intense negotiations between industry and consumer rights groups over whether and how to allow consumers to limit tracking.  Congress is likely to revisit online security legislation -- meant to safeguard critical infrastructure from attack -- that failed last year. And a looming question for Web giants will be who takes the reins of the Federal Trade Commission, the industry's main regulator, this year. David C. Vladeck, the director of the commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, has resigned, and there have been suggestions that the chairman of the commission itself, Jon Leibowitz, will step down. The agency is investigating Google over possible antitrust violations and will subject Facebook to audits of its privacy policy for the next 20 years. Its next steps could serve as a bellwether of how aggressively the commission will take on Web companies in the second Obama administration. ''Now that the election is over, Silicon Valley companies each are thinking through their strategy for the second Obama administration,'' said Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University and a former White House privacy official. ''The F.T.C. will have a new Democratic chairman. A priority for tech companies will be to discern the new chair's own priorities.'' In early 2012, an unusual burst of lobbying by tech companies helped defeat antipiracy bills, which had been backed by the entertainment industry. Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google feared that the bills would force them to police the Internet. At the end of the year, Silicon Valley also got its way when the Obama administration stood up against a proposed global treaty that would have given government authorities greater control over the Web. The key to the industry's successes in 2012 was simple: it expanded its footprint in Washington just as Washington began to pay closer attention to how technology companies affect consumers. ''Privacy and security became top-tier important policy issues in Washington in 2012,'' said David A. Hoffman, director of security policy and global privacy officer at Intel. ''Industry has realized it is important to be engaged,'' he continued, ''to make sure government stakeholders are fully informed and educated about the role that new technology plays and to make sure any action taken doesn't unnecessarily burden the innovation economy while still protecting individual trust in new technology.'' At the end of 2012, tech companies were on track to have spent record amounts on lobbying for the year. In the first three quarters, they spent close to $100 million, which meant that they were likely to surpass the $127 million they spent on lobbying in 2011, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that tracks corporate spending. Even the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz hired a lobbyist in Washington: Adrian Fenty, a former mayor of the city. Technology executives and investors also made generous contributions in the 2012 presidential race, luring both President Obama and Mitt Romney to Northern California for fund-raisers and nudging them to speak out on issues like immigration overhaul and lower tax rates. In a blog post in November, the center said Silicon Valley's lobbying expenditures have ballooned in recent years, even as spending by other industries has fallen. Facebook more than doubled its lobbying outlay in the year, reporting close to $2.6 million through the third quarter of 2012. Google spent more than any other company in the industry, doling out more than $13 million in the same period and more than double its nearest competitor, Microsoft, which spent just over $5.6 million in the same period. Among Google's advocates on Capitol Hill is a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari, who heads Google's office in Washington. Google has particular reason to be engaged. It faces a wide-reaching antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, just as Microsoft did a decade ago. At issue is whether Google's search engine results favor Google products over its rivals'. Although the agency was ready to settle that case before the holidays, without harsh remedies, late last month it shelved the inquiry and put stronger penalties back in play. A resolution is expected in January. The commission has already fined Google on a separate matter. In 2012, the company paid $22.5 million to settle charges that it had bypassed privacy settings in Apple's Safari browser to track users and serve them targeted advertisements. Facebook has vastly expanded its Washington presence in recent years. It has set up a political action committee, hired a stable of seasoned, well-connected insiders from both parties and offered tips to lawmakers in an effort to make its site indispensable to politicians seeking re-election. Facebook scored a win on Capitol Hill in late 2012 when it nudged Congress to amend a 1988 law, the Video Privacy Protection Act, that had protected the privacy of Americans' video rental records. Facebook and its partner, Netflix, the video streaming service, advocated for changes in the law so that movies watched on Netflix could be shared on Facebook. That kind of data can be valuable for behavioral advertising, a principal source of revenue for Web services like Facebook. The company also attracted increased scrutiny from the F.T.C. The agency negotiated a consent order with Facebook to settle charges that it had engaged in ''unfair and deceptive practices'' when changes in its settings revealed personal information that Facebook users had regarded to be private. As part of the settlement, Facebook agreed to audits of its privacy policies for 20 years. Facebook faced renewed public outcry last month when its subsidiary, Instagram, proposed to deploy users' pictures to serve targeted advertisements. The company has backtracked on that proposal, but the outcry, say consumer privacy advocates, is an indication of public sentiment. ''Yes, the industry managed to hold off privacy legislation this year,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''But if the end-of-year protests over the Facebook and Instagram changes are any indication, users will be pressing for better privacy protections in the next Congress.'' Silicon Valley's lobbying efforts are also likely to expand across the Atlantic in 2013. Both Facebook and Google have faced off with European regulators over privacy issues. Now, the European Parliament is weighing an overhaul of data protection laws that apply across the Continent. One of the proposed changes requires Web companies to ask European Union citizens for their explicit consent before collecting personal data for targeted Web advertising. Web companies vigorously oppose that and other proposals. "
Harvard Explains Why Staff E-Mails Were Searched,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard and its president on Monday made their first public comments on the university's searching of staff members' e-mail accounts, and offered a qualified apology for keeping the searches secret from most of the employees involved. The episode has angered faculty members and refocused attention on Harvard's largest cheating scandal in memory, which involved a take-home final exam in a government class last spring. After an investigation, about 70 students were forced to take a leave of absence.  In September, when confidential information about cheating cases appeared in news reports, administrators ordered searches of the e-mail accounts of 16 resident deans, to find the source of the leaks. In an online statement posted Monday morning, university officials acknowledged the searches and explained their reasoning. The statement eased the concerns of some faculty members but did not alleviate them completely, and professors said they expected that e-mail privacy would be the topic of a full-throated discussion at the next faculty meeting, in early April. In her first comment on the matter, Harvard's president, Drew Gilpin Faust, said that she did not know about the searches at the time, but that having been apprised, ''I feel very comfortable that great care was taken to safeguard the privacy of all concerned.'' Faculty responses revealed a gap between expectations in academia, where privacy is often seen as integral to academic freedom, and the corporate world, in which employees are often told to assume that workplace e-mails are not private. Some professors wondered aloud whether they had been naïve to think that things would be different at a university, and said they were forced to re-examine assumptions about confidentiality. ''It's disturbing because I don't know what it means about whether they could look at my own e-mail,'' said Oliver Hart, an economics professor. ''We need to have a discussion and a better understanding of the policy.'' He and other professors said the searches would prompt him to conduct more business through private e-mail accounts outside of Harvard's reach. Most professors who agreed to discuss the matter on Monday insisted on anonymity, not wanting to run afoul of the administration. Several of them, conceding that the university had a legal right to conduct the searches, said the problem was, as one put it, that ''we never thought they would -- we never thought about it at all, and we probably should have.'' One leak last year involved an e-mail from the university's Administrative Board to resident deans, offering guidance on how to advise students accused of cheating. Some have questioned why such a minor breach prompted an investigation. But the statement posted Monday, attributed to Michael D. Smith, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, and Evelynn M. Hammonds, dean of Harvard College, said administrators were more troubled by another leak, recounting closed-door discussions by the Administrative Board. ''The disclosure of the document and nearly word-for-word disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information -- especially student information we have a duty to protect as private -- was at risk,'' the deans wrote. Resident deans live among students in Harvard's residential houses and act as student advisers, and they are also lecturers, meaning that they teach courses but are not on a tenure track to professorship. Each one generally has a personal Harvard e-mail account and one specifically for the job of resident dean. The deans' statement on Monday emphasized that the search was conducted only of the resident dean accounts, not personal ones, and only for the subject line on each message, to determine whether the confidential e-mail had been forwarded. The search determined that one resident dean had forwarded the e-mail to two students who were accused of cheating and had sought the dean's advice. Deans Hammonds and Smith wrote that the resident dean who had forwarded the messages did so in good faith and was not punished. The statement did not say whether administrators determined how the e-mail found its way to the news media, or who was responsible for the other leak, of the Administrative Board's deliberations. That resident dean and one other were told about the e-mail searches shortly after they took place, administrators said, but the other 14 resident deans were not told until last week, after The Boston Globe inquired about the matter. They were not told to protect ''the privacy of the resident dean who had made an inadvertent error,'' Deans Hammonds and Smith wrote. ''We understand that others may see the situation differently, and we apologize if any resident deans feel our communication at the conclusion of the investigation was insufficient.'' On his blog, Michael Mitzenmacher, a computer science professor, wrote that he was satisfied with some parts of the administration's explanation, but ''in my opinion, the administration made an error in judgment'' in not telling the resident deans of the search. Wilfried Schmid, a mathematics professor, said he still wanted to know more about what happened. ''I certainly get the sense that many of my colleagues will be upset, and so there will be a discussion,'' he said. But he urged the faculty not to lose sight of what he considered the bigger issue, the cheating episode itself. "
U.S. Charges Three With Hacking,"Federal authorities charged three Eastern European men with using a computer virus, nicknamed Gozi, that surreptitiously infected over a million computers worldwide, including at NASA, to steal what prosecutors said was at least tens of millions of dollars from personal bank accounts.  The Justice Department unsealed indictments on Wednesday morning in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case highlights the multinational criminal networks that develop and rent out computer malware. In this case, a Russian national, Nikita Kuzmin, is accused of developing the virus. Dennis Calovskis of Latvia is accused of modifying it so it could mimic a bank's Web page, prompting account holders to divulge their personal information. Ionut Paunescu of Romania is accused of hosting command and control servers, shielding them to evade detection. Federal law enforcement officers arrested Mr. Kuzmin as he visited California in 2010 and persuaded him to cooperate. He helped prosecutors nab the other two men, who were arrested in late 2012 in their home countries and are awaiting extradition. Most of the infected computers were in Europe. Federal law enforcement officials said that although NASA computers were among the 25,000 devices infected inside the United States, they did not believe sensitive strategic information was stolen. The criminal network was motivated by commercial gain, officials said.  "
Facebook Says Hackers Breached Its Computers," Facebook admitted that it was breached by sophisticated hackers in recent weeks, two weeks after Twitter made a similar admission. Both Facebook and Twitter were breached through a well-publicized vulnerability in Oracle's Java software. In a blog post late Friday afternoon, Facebook said it was attacked when a handful of its employees visited a compromised site for mobile developers. Simply by visiting the site, their computers were infected with malware. The company said that as soon as it discovered the malware, it cleaned up the infected machines and tipped off law enforcement. ""We have found no evidence that Facebook user data was compromised,"" Facebook said.  On Feb. 1, Twitter said hackers had breached its systems and potentially accessed the data of 250,000 Twitter users. The company suggested at that time that it was one of several companies and organizations to be have been similarly attacked. Facebook has known about its own breach for at least a month, according to people close to the investigation, but it was unclear why the company waited this long to announce it. Fred Wolens, a Facebook spokesman, declined to comment. Like Twitter, Facebook said it believed that it was one of several organizations that were targeted by the same group of attackers. ""Facebook was not alone in this attack,"" the company said in its blog post. ""It is clear that others were attacked and infiltrated recently as well."" The attacks add to the mounting evidence that hackers were able to use the security hole in Oracle's Java software to steal information from a broad range of companies. Java, a widely used programming language, is installed on more than three billion devices. It has long been hounded by security problems. Last month, after a security researcher exposed a serious vulnerability in the software, the Department of Homeland Security issued a rare alert that warned users to disable Java on their computers. The vulnerability was particularly disconcerting because it let attackers download a malicious program onto its victims' machines without any prompting. Users did not even have to click on a malicious link for their computers to be infected. The program simply downloaded itself. After Oracle initially patched the security hole in January, the Department of Homeland Security said that the fix was not sufficient and recommended that, unless ""absolutely necessary"", users should disable it on their computers completely. Oracle did not issue another fix until Feb. 1. Social networks are a prime target for hackers, who look to use people's personal data and social connections in what are known as ""spearphishing"" attacks. In this type of attack, a target is sent an e-mail, ostensibly from a connection, containing a malicious link or attachment. Once the link is clicked or attachment opened, attackers take control of a user's computer. If the infected computer is inside a company's system, the attackers are able to gain a foothold. In many cases, they then extract passwords and gain access to sensitive data. Facebook said in its blog post that the updated patch addressed the vulnerability that allowed hackers to access its employees' computers. Hackers have been attacking organizations inside the United States at an alarming rate. The number of attacks reported by government agencies last year topped 48,500 - a ninefold jump from the 5,500 attacks reported in 2006, according to the Government Accountability Office. In the last month alone, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post all confirmed that they were targets of sophisticated hackers. But security experts say that these attacks are just the tip of the iceberg. A common saying among security experts is that there are now only two types of American companies: Those that have been hacked and those that don't know they've been hacked.  "
Waging Privacy Fight as F.B.I. Pursued Snowden,"DALLAS -- One day last May, Ladar Levison returned home to find an F.B.I. agent's business card on his Dallas doorstep. So began a four-month tangle with law enforcement officials that would end with Mr. Levison's shutting the business he had spent a decade building and becoming an unlikely hero of privacy advocates in their escalating battle with the government over Internet security. Prosecutors, it turned out, were pursuing a notable user of Lavabit, Mr. Levison's secure e-mail service: Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified documents that have put the intelligence agency under sharp scrutiny. Mr. Levison was willing to allow investigators with a court order to tap Mr. Snowden's e-mail account; he had complied with similar narrowly targeted requests involving other customers about two dozen times. But they wanted more, he said: the passwords, encryption keys and computer code that would essentially allow the government untrammeled access to the protected messages of all his customers. That, he said, was too much.  ''You don't need to bug an entire city to bug one guy's phone calls,'' Mr. Levison, 32, said in a recent interview. ''In my case, they wanted to break open the entire box just to get to one connection.'' On Aug. 8, Mr. Levison closed Lavabit rather than, in his view, betray his promise of secure e-mail to his customers. The move, which he explained in a letter on his Web site, drew fervent support from civil libertarians but was seen by prosecutors as an act of defiance that fell just short of a crime. The full story of what happened to Mr. Levison since May has not previously been told, in part because he was subject to a court's gag order. But on Wednesday, a federal judge unsealed documents in the case, allowing the tech entrepreneur to speak candidly for the first time about his experiences. He had been summoned to testify to a grand jury in Virginia; forbidden to discuss his case; held in contempt of court and fined $10,000 for handing over his private encryption keys on paper and not in digital form; and, finally, threatened with arrest for saying too much when he shuttered his business. Spokesmen for the Justice Department and the F.B.I. said they had no comment beyond what was in the documents. Mr. Levison's battle to preserve his customers' privacy comes at a time when Mr. Snowden's disclosures have ignited a national debate about the proper limits of surveillance and government intrusion into American Internet companies that promise users that their digital communications are secure. Much of the attention has been focused on Internet giants like Microsoft and Google. Lavabit, with just two employees and perhaps 40,000 regular users, was a midget by comparison, but its size and Mr. Levison's personal pledge of security made it attractive to tech-savvy users like Mr. Snowden. While Mr. Levison's struggles have been with the F.B.I., hovering in the background is the N.S.A., which has worked secretly for years to undermine or bypass encrypted services like Lavabit so that their electronic message scrambling cannot obstruct the agency's spying. Earlier in September, The New York Times, ProPublica and The Guardian wrote about the N.S.A.'s campaign to weaken encryption. Mr. Levison's case shows how law enforcement officials can use legal tools to pry open messages, no matter how well protected. Mr. Levison said he set up Lavabit to make it impossible for outsiders, whether governments or hackers, to spy on users' communications. He followed the government's own secure coding guidelines, based on the N.S.A.'s technical guidance, and engineered his systems so as not to log user communications. That way, even if he received a subpoena for a user's communications, he would not be able to gain access to them. For added measure, he gave customers the option to pay extra to encrypt their e-mail and passwords. Mr. Levison, who studied politics and computer science at Southern Methodist University, started Lavabit in April 2004, the same month Google rolled out Gmail. To pay his bills, he worked as a Web consultant, helping develop Web sites for major brands like Dr Pepper, Nokia and Adidas. But by 2010, the e-mail service had attracted enough paying customers to allow Mr. Levison to turn to Lavabit full time. On occasion, he was asked to comply with government requests for specific e-mail accounts, including that of a child pornography suspect in Maryland this year. Mr. Levison said he had no qualms about cooperating with such demands, but the latest request was far broader, apparently to allow investigators to track Mr. Snowden's whereabouts and associates. When Mr. Levison called the F.B.I. agent who had left the business card, the agent seemed interested in learning how Lavabit worked and what tools would be necessary to eavesdrop on an encrypted e-mail account. The agent did not mention at first who the government was pursuing, and Mr. Levison will not name the targets of the government's investigation. The name was redacted from the court order unsealed Wednesday, but the offenses listed are violations of the Espionage Act, and the timing of the government's case coincides with its leak investigation into Mr. Snowden, which began in May when he fled Hawaii for Hong Kong carrying laptops containing thousands of classified documents. By then, Mr. Snowden's Lavabit e-mail address was already public. He had listed his personal Lavabit e-mail address in January 2010, and was still using a Lavabit address this July, when he summoned reporters to a news conference at the Moscow airport. That e-mail invitation proved to be an unintended endorsement for Lavabit's security. Before that, Mr. Levison said that, on average, Lavabit was signing up 200 new users daily. In the days after Mr. Snowden's e-mail, more than 4,000 new customers joined each day. But a month before the news conference, court documents show, Mr. Levison had already received a subpoena for Mr. Snowden's encrypted e-mail account. The government was particularly interested in his e-mail metadata -- with whom Mr. Snowden was communicating, when and from where. The order, from the Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., required Mr. Levison to log Mr. Snowden's account information and provide the F.B.I. with ''technical assistance,'' which agents told him meant handing over the private encryption keys, technically called SSL certificates, that unlock communications for all users, he said. ''It was the equivalent of asking Coca-Cola to hand over its secret formula,'' Mr. Levison said. By July, he said, he had 410,000 registered users. Similar services like Hushmail, a Canadian encrypted e-mail service, had lost users in 2007 after court documents revealed that the company had handed 12 CDs' worth of decoded e-mails from three Hushmail accounts to American law enforcement officials through a mutual assistance treaty. ''The whole concept of the Internet was built on the idea that companies can keep their own keys,'' Mr. Levison said. He told the agents that he would need their request for his encryption keys in writing. A redacted version of that request, which was among the 23 documents that were unsealed, shows that the court issued an order July 16 for Lavabit's encryption keys. Prosecutors said they had no intention of collecting any information on Lavabit's 400,000 other customers. ''There's no agents looking through the 400,000 other bits of information, customers, whatever,'' Jim Trump, one of the prosecutors, said at a closed Aug. 1 hearing. But Mr. Levison said he spent much of the following day thinking of a compromise. He would log the target's communications, unscramble them with the encryption keys and upload them to a government server once a day. The F.B.I. told him that was not enough. It needed his target's communications ''in real time,'' he said. ''How as a small business do you hire the lawyers to appeal this and change public opinion to get the laws changed when Congress doesn't even know what is going on?'' Mr. Levison said. When it was clear Mr. Levison had no choice but to comply, he devised a way to obey the order but make the government's intrusion more arduous. On Aug 2, he infuriated agents by printing the encryption keys -- long strings of seemingly random numbers -- on paper in a font he believed would be hard to scan and turn into a usable digital format. Indeed, prosecutors described the file as ''largely illegible.'' On Aug. 5, Judge Claude M. Hilton ordered a $5,000-a-day fine until Mr. Levison produced the keys in electronic form. Mr. Levison's lawyer, Jesse R. Binnall, appealed both the order to turn over the keys and the fine. After two days, Mr. Levison gave in, turning over the digital keys -- and simultaneously closing his e-mail service, apologizing to customers on his site. That double maneuver, a prosecutor later told his lawyer, fell just short of a criminal act. He hopes to resurrect the business he spent a decade building. ''This wasn't about one person,'' Mr. Levison said. ''This was about the lengths our government was willing to go to conduct Internet surveillance on one person.'' "
"Twitter Says Cyberattack Affected 250,000 Accounts","Twitter announced late Friday that it had been breached and that data for 250,000 Twitter users was vulnerable. The company said in a blog post that it detected unusual access patterns earlier this week and found that user information - usernames, e-mail addresses and encrypted passwords - for 250,000 users may have been accessed in what it described as a ""sophisticated attack.""  ""This attack was not the work of amateurs, and we do not believe it was an isolated incident,"" Bob Lord, Twitter's director of information security, said in a blog post. ""The attackers were extremely sophisticated, and we believe other companies and organizations have also been recently similarly attacked."" Jim Prosser, a spokesman for Twitter, would not say how hackers were able to infiltrate Twitter's systems, but Twitter's blog post alluded that hackers had broken in through a well-publicized vulnerability in Oracle's Java software. Java, a widely used programming language, is installed on more than three billion devices and has long been dogged by security problems. Last month, after a security researcher exposed a serious vulnerability in the software, the Department of Homeland Security issued a rare alert that warned users to disable Java on their computers. The vulnerability was particularly disconcerting because it let attackers download a malicious program onto its victims' machines without any prompting. Users did not even have to click on a malicious link for their computers to be infected. The program simply downloaded itself. Oracle patched the security hole, but Homeland Security said that the fix was not sufficient. ""Unless it is absolutely necessary to run Java in Web browsers, disable it,"" the agency said in an updated alert. ""This will help mitigate other Java vulnerabilities that may be discovered in the future."" ""We also echo the advisory from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and security experts to encourage users to disable Java on their computers,"" Mr. Lord said in the blog post. Apple no longer ships its machines with Java enabled by default and disabled the software remotely on Macs machines where it had already been installed. Those who do not own Macs can disable the software using detailed instructions on Oracle's Java Web site. Mr. Prosser said Twitter was working with government and federal law enforcement to track down the source of the attacks. For now, he said the company had reset passwords for, and notified, every compromised user. The company encouraged users to practice good password hygiene, which typically means coming up with different passwords for different sites, and using long passwords that cannot be found in the dictionary. Twitter did say it ""hashed"" passwords -- which involves mashing up users' passwords with a mathematical algorithm -- and ""salted"" them, meaning it appended random digits to the end of each hashed password to make it more difficult, but not impossible, for hackers to crack. Once cracked, passwords can be valuable on auctionlike black market sites where a single password can fetch $20. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"The Year in Hacking, by the Numbers","Security experts like to say that there are now only two types of companies left in the United States: those that have been hacked and those that don't know they've been hacked. Their latest supporting evidence comes in the form of an annual Verizon report, which counted 621 confirmed data breaches last year, and more than 47,000 reported ""security incidents."" Those include distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, in which hackers flood a site with traffic until it falls offline, but do not necessarily break into a company's network. The victims spanned a wide range of industries. Thirty-seven percent of breached companies were financial firms; 24 percent were retailers and restaurants; 20 percent involved manufacturing, transportation and utility industries; and 20 percent of the breaches affected organizations that Verizon qualified as ""information and professional services firms."" (The totals exceed 100 percent because of rounding.)  ""The results validate that any business that operates online is at potential risk of suffering a data breach,"" said Wade Baker, one of the report's principal authors. ""We talk to a lot of actors that are flabbergasted that they would be attacked by a group based across the world. But the report shows that no matter the size of the organization - large, small, government agencies, banks, restaurants, retailers - people are stealing data from a range of different organizations and it's a problem everyone has to deal with."" Verizon collaborated with 18 organizations to feed data into this year's report. Three quarters of successful breaches were done by profit-minded criminals for financial gain. But the second most common type of breach was a state-affiliated attack ""aimed at stealing intellectual property - such as classified information, trade secrets and technical resources - to further national and economic interests."" Verizon said that only a slim minority - 14 percent - of all data breaches were the work of insiders. Most were the work work of external actors who are often difficult to pinpoint because attackers often route their Web traffic through infected computers around the world. But Mr. Baker said victims were able to trace the attacks back to state-affiliated groups in ""two out of three cases."" In those cases, Verizon said that the majority- 30 percent- of all attacks originated in China. Government officials in the United States recently started stepping up diplomatic pressure on China to curtail cyberespionage that originates from within its borders. Last month, the Obama administration demanded that the Chinese government stop the theft of data from American computer networks. And on Monday, cybersecurity was the focus of a meeting between the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, and Gen. Fang Fenghui of China. Surprisingly, the second most common origin of attacks was Romania, where hackers accounted for 28 percent of all data breaches. The third most common origin of attacks was the United States, which accounted for 18 percent of all attacks. In 76 percent of data breaches, weak or stolen user names and passwords were a cause. In 40 percent of cases, Verizon said the attackers installed malicious software on the victim's systems; 35 percent of cases involved ""physical attacks"" in which the attackers did physical harm, to a skimmer at an automated teller machine, for instance. In 29 percent of breaches, the attackers leveraged social tactics, such as spear phishing, in which a tailored e-mail to the victim purports to come from a friend or business contact. The e-mails contain malicious links or attachments that, when clicked, give the attacker a foothold in the victim's computer network. Verizon said it witnessed four times as many ""social engineering"" attacks that used this method in 2012 as it did in 2011. That method, Verizon said, was most popular among attackers in cyberespionage campaigns. The Verizon report also highlighted the lag between the time an organization has been breached and the time it discovers the breach. ""The compromise-to-discovery timeline continues to be measured in months and even years, as opposed to hours and days,"" the report said.  "
Encryption Flaw Makes Phones Possible Accomplices in Theft,"BERLIN -- If your identity has been stolen, your phone may have been an accomplice to the crime. A German mobile security expert says he has found a flaw in the encryption technology used in some SIM cards, the chips in handsets, that could enable cyber criminals to take control of a person's phone. Karsten Nohl, founder of Security Research Labs in Berlin, said the encryption hole allowed outsiders to obtain a SIM card's digital key, a 56-digit sequence that opens the chip up to modification. With that key in hand, Mr. Nohl said, he was able to send a virus to the SIM card through a text message, which let him eavesdrop on a caller, make purchases through mobile payment systems and even impersonate the phone's owner.  He said he had managed the whole operation in about two minutes, using a simple personal computer. He estimates as many as 750 million phones may be vulnerable to attacks. ''We can remotely install software on a handset that operates completely independently from your phone,'' Mr. Nohl said. ''We can spy on you. We know your encryption keys for calls. We can read your S.M.S.'s. More than just spying, we can steal data from the SIM card, your mobile identity, and charge to your account.'' Mr. Nohl is well known in security circles. In 2009, he published a software tool that computes the 64-bit key used to encrypt conversations on GSM networks, prompting the industry to adopt better safeguards. His company, Security Research Labs, advises German and U.S. multinational companies on mobile security issues. Mr. Nohl said the flaw he had discovered was the result of an encryption method developed in the 1970s called data encryption standard, or D.E.S. After uncovering the breach, he researched the pervasiveness of the problem by testing about 1,000 SIM cards on cellphones running on mobile networks in Europe and North America over a two-year period. The phones and SIM cards were owned and used by himself and members of his research team. Mr. Nohl said that about one-quarter of the SIM cards running the older encryption technology exhibited the flaw. D.E.S. encryption is used on about half of the about six billion cellphones in use daily. Over the past decade, most operators have adopted a stronger encryption method, called Triple D.E.S., but many SIM cards still run the old standard. The encryption is used to disguise the SIM card, and thus a mobile phone's unique digital signature. Mr. Nohl has shared the results of his two-year study with the GSM Association, an organization based in London that represents the mobile industry, through a process of ''responsible disclosure.'' On Aug. 1, he plans to present the full details of his research at the Black Hat conference, a computer hackers' gathering, in Las Vegas. In a statement, a GSM Association spokeswoman, Claire Cranton, said Mr. Nohl had sent the association outlines of his study, which the organization had passed along to operators and to makers of SIM cards that still relied on the older encryption standard. ''We have been able to consider the implications and provide guidance to those network operators and SIM vendors that may be impacted,'' Ms. Cranton said. She added that it was likely only a minority of phones using the older standard ''could be vulnerable.'' Ms. Cranton declined to comment on Mr. Nohl's estimate that 750 million cellphones might be open to attack, saying the association would not comment until it had reviewed Mr. Nohl's full research findings in Las Vegas. A large maker of SIM cards, the Dutch company Gemalto, said the GSM Association had told it of Mr. Nohl's preliminary findings. A second maker of SIM cards, the German company Giesecke & Devrient, said it had ''analyzed this attack scenario.'' Gemalto has been working closely with the association and other industry groups ''to look into the first outline given by Mr. Nohl,'' Gemalto said in a statement. The company said the GSM Association had already disseminated Mr. Nohl's findings to group members. Mr. Nohl was able to derive the SIM card's digital key by sending an SMS disguised as having been sent from the mobile operator. Carriers routinely send specially coded messages to handsets to validate customers' identities for billing and mobile transactions. For each message, the network and the phone verify their identities by comparing digital signatures. The message sent by Mr. Nohl deliberately used a false signature for the network. In three-quarters of messages sent to mobile phones using D.E.S. encryption, the handset recognized the false signature and ended communication. But in a quarter of cases, the phone broke off the communication and sent an error message back to Mr. Nohl that included its own encrypted digital signature. The communication provided Mr. Nohl with enough information to derive the SIM card's digital key. Mr. Nohl said he had advised the GSM Association and chip makers to use better filtering technology to block the kind of messages he had sent. He also advised operators to phase out SIM cards using D.E.S. encryption in favor of newer standards. He added that consumers using SIM cards more than three years old should get new cards from their carriers. Giesecke & Devrient, in a statement, said that it had begun phasing out SIM cards using D.E.S. encryption in 2008. The German company said the unique operating system used in its SIM cards, even those running D.E.S. encryption, would prevent a phone from inadvertently sending the kind of ''message authentication code'' that Mr. Nohl had used to pierce the encryption. Mr. Nohl said he was not planning to disclose the identities of the operators whose SIM cards had performed poorly in his study at the Black Hat conference in August. But he said that he planned to publish a comparative list of SIM card security by operator in December at a computer hackers' conference in Hamburg, Germany, called the Chaos Communication Congress.

Bitcoin Scandal Reflects Popularity of Virtual Currency in China,"On Oct. 26, the website of Global Bond Limited, a Chinese exchange platform for bitcoins, the booming digital currency, suddenly went dead. Then, without warning, GBL's roughly 500 remaining investors were kicked out of the company's official QQ group, a social media platform that the company was using for investor relations. By nightfall, the scale of the swindle was made public - 25 million renminbi, or $4.1 million  - making it one of the largest bitcoin fraud cases since the currency's inception four years ago. ""We want to find the culprits and make then return our hard-earned, sweat-stained money!"" read one post by a victim on Sina Weibo, China's most popular Twitter-like microblog. ""Help us find the criminals!""  In hindsight, there were numerous red flags that should have alerted GBL's bamboozled investors. On May 27, just days after GBL was founded, a popular Chinese bitcoin forum pointed out that the company claimed to be based in Hong Kong, but  in fact was using servers located in Beijing. In addition, GBL lacked an official company email address and did not have a license to provide financial services. The willingness to invest in GBL despite its shortcomings demonstrates just how popular ""crypto-currency"" has become in China. In early November, BTC China overtook Mt. Gox and Bistamp to become the largest bitcoin exchange site in the world, handling 34 percent of global bitcoin transactions over the previous seven days, according todatafrom Bitcoinity.org, a website that tracks bitcoin exchanges. Bitcoin's appeal to Chinese investors is manifold. The currency experienced a major spike in value in July shortly after being the subject of overwhelmingly favorable reports on CCTV, China's state-run television station, and People's Daily, the main Communist Party newspaper. The currency received a further boost in October when the Chinese search engine Baidu, which commands more than 80 percent of the Chinese search market, announced a plan to accept bitcoins as payment for its online security and firewall services. Last week, a real estate developer in Shanghai declaredthat it would accept bitcoins as payment for housing units in the city's Pudong district. The company, Shanda Tiandi, posts bitcoin exchange values daily outside its office. This raises the possibility that China's high-net-worth investors could try to use bitcoins to circumvent strict investment caps on the property market.  Analysts say that there is a deeper and more contentious reason for China's bitcoin boom. The popularity of the digital currency has been linked to the fact that China's citizens are unable to trade the renminbi as freely as people in other countries trade their own currencies. Beijing keeps a close grip on the renminbi, concerned about potential disruptions to the economy that could result from sudden outflows or inflows of funds. Should the government decide to crack down on the bitcoin, which some experts say is possible in the aftermath of such a major fraud case, it has the legal grounds to do so. In 2009, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Culture issued a rule prohibiting the exchange of virtual currency for renminbi, as well as the purchase of real-world goods and services with virtual currency. According to sources within the tech industry, the 2009 rule was aimed mainly at companies like Tencent Holdings - the parent company of the above-mentioned QQ platform - that allow online game players to use virtual currency to purchase virtual items. But the backbone of the rule is clear: Virtual currencies must stay out of the real economy.  "
Talking Cyberthreat With China,"BEIJING -- We confront the problem of I.T. weaponry and national security today with the same uncertainty that we brought to nuclear weapons during the early years of the Cold War. We're aware something dangerous is in our hands; we are less certain what to do about it. And while the very newness of the field means discussion now is necessarily tentative, one of the lessons of today's technology is that newness creates the possibility for fast progress. Such a possibility exists in discussions this week between U.S. and Chinese representatives in Washington, the first ever working-level cybersecurity engagement between the two nations.  The debate about U.S.-China cyberissues reflects all the symptoms of a larger unease about the information age. Machines and networks have insinuated themselves into every corner of our lives, and we get the sense that they are slipping out of our understanding, if not out of our control. Just pressing an on-off switch implies consenting to deeper, not fully clear rules and risks. This is hard enough to make sense of in the debate about domestic liberty. Cast in the context of two great and uneasy powers, the problem touches hot buttons that have fired some of the worst conflicts in history: territoriality, trust and arms race. One of the first things American and Chinese officials will acknowledge when they sit down this week is how little we know about I.T. systems and national security. But it's important they look beyond immediate issues of hacking and to the deeper problems of power in this new age. Network technology challenges many traditional international rules. The treaties of Westphalia in the mid-17th century, for instance, assumed a state monopoly on violence. But with virtual world weapons, control is harder to define. One can easily imagine a moment in which U.S. and Chinese leaders agree to dial back tensions on some issue only to see privateering nationalist hackers on both sides take up cudgels anyway. Or consider the fact that cyberattacks usually exploit unseen vulnerabilities. So nearly every strike is a ''surprise attack'' -- an anxiety-inducing quirk that argues against the ''trust first, adjust later'' approach essential for dampening the shock of the inevitable crises. Even the most basic question of any new weapons technology -- does it mostly benefit offensive or defensive military action? -- is unclear in this new world. This matters, because misjudgments on this score can lead to deadly miscalculations. A hundred years ago European leaders thought the machine gun was a devastating offensive weapon. They had it wrong and World War I proved to be a five-year defensive bloodbath. Moreover, one of the charms of new technology -- the speed of innovation -- means strategic arrangements made today may be obsolete tomorrow. Consider artificial intelligence: Every day, thinking machines are becoming more important for analyzing data. But as these machines develop, they become ever harder to regulate. If traditional hacking is stoppable because you can always find the hackers, machine-intelligence systems that probe and poke each other may be far harder to understand or regulate with treaties. Given this complexity, what might be accomplished between the United States and China? Here are three possibilities: The two sides could agree to set up a joint, open-network monitoring center staffed by civilian engineers. It should be passive at first -- a group that simply monitors and discusses things like hourly trends in data traffic or stresses on the core I.P. backbone. It should also include attempts to develop notification and management protocols for various emergencies. The effort could also lead to the creation of a ''bit line'' for cyberemergencies that can serve the purpose a ''hot line'' does for traditional security. It would allow the sides to be in immediate, technical contact, and it would foster habits of cooperation and trust. Practically, it may be desirable to set this center up as a ''learning experiment'' designed to be closed after a fixed time, say three years, and ''rebooted'' in some new form. This time-limited approach suits a world where upgrades are essential. It would also give both sides flexibility on initial terms. Similarly, the center could be a bilateral arrangement in year one and then open to other nations as observers in subsequent years. On artificial intelligence, both sides should set up programs to bring engineers together to discuss emerging norms. Informal collaborative work is already under way in this area -- if you came to next week's Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conference in Washington State, you'd see how many teams contain both American and Chinese researchers. Finally, the two sides could examine what concepts such as ''no first use'' could mean in a cyberenvironment. In particular, the United States should lead an effort to create a framework that, like the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, would offer benefits to countries that sign up. In any event, this should be a part of America's new strategy for a network age. China is a good place to start. The best hope for avoiding a confrontation between rising and established powers is to be creative in developing fresh institutions. We live, after all, in a revolutionary age. The challenge the United States and China face together is not only the interoperability of two great nations. It is the future interoperability of man and machine.

Daily Report: Pentagon Expanding Online Defenses," Defense officials say that the Pentagon is moving toward a major expansion of its cybersecurity force to counter increasing attacks on the nation's computer networks, as well as to expand offensive computer operations on foreign adversaries, Elisabeth Bumiller reports on Monday in The New York Times.  The expansion would increase the Defense Department's Cyber Command by more than 4,000 people, up from 900, an American official said. Defense officials acknowledged that a formidable challenge in the growth of the command would be finding, training and holding on to such a large number of qualified people. The Pentagon ""is constantly looking to recruit, train and retain world class cyberpersonnel,"" a defense official said Sunday. ""The threat is real, and we need to react to it,"" said William J. Lynn III, a former deputy defense secretary who worked on the Pentagon's cybersecurity strategy. As part of the expansion, officials said the Pentagon was planning three different forces under Cyber Command: ""national mission forces"" to protect computer systems that support the nation's power grid and critical infrastructure, ""combat mission forces"" to plan and execute attacks on adversaries and ""cyber protection forces"" to secure the Pentagon's computer systems. The move, part of a push by Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta to bolster the Pentagon's cyberoperations, was first reported on The Washington Post's Web site. In October, Mr. Panetta warned in dire terms that the United States was facing the possibility of a ""cyber-Pearl Harbor"" and was increasingly vulnerable to foreign computer hackers who could dismantle the nation's power grid, transportation system, financial network and government. He said that ""an aggressor nation"" or extremist group could cause a national catastrophe, and that he was reacting to increasing assertiveness and technological advances by the nation's adversaries, which officials identified as China, Russia, Iran and militant groups.

Nations Buying as Hackers Sell Knowledge of Software Flaws,"On the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta, two Italian hackers have been searching for bugs -- not the island's many beetle varieties, but secret flaws in computer code that governments pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to learn about and exploit. The hackers, Luigi Auriemma, 32, and Donato Ferrante, 28, sell technical details of such vulnerabilities to countries that want to break into the computer systems of foreign adversaries. The two will not reveal the clients of their company, ReVuln, but big buyers of services like theirs include the National Security Agency -- which seeks the flaws for America's growing arsenal of cyberweapons -- and American adversaries like the Revolutionary Guards of Iran. All over the world, from South Africa to South Korea, business is booming in what hackers call ''zero days,'' the coding flaws in software like Microsoft Windows that can give a buyer unfettered access to a computer and any business, agency or individual dependent on one. Just a few years ago, hackers like Mr. Auriemma and Mr. Ferrante would have sold the knowledge of coding flaws to companies like Microsoft and Apple, which would fix them. Last month, Microsoft sharply increased the amount it was willing to pay for such flaws, raising its top offer to $150,000.  But increasingly the businesses are being outbid by countries with the goal of exploiting the flaws in pursuit of the kind of success, albeit temporary, that the United States and Israel achieved three summers ago when they attacked Iran's nuclear enrichment program with a computer worm that became known as ''Stuxnet.'' The flaws get their name from the fact that once discovered, ''zero days'' exist for the user of the computer system to fix them before hackers can take advantage of the vulnerability. A ''zero-day exploit'' occurs when hackers or governments strike by using the flaw before anyone else knows it exists, like a burglar who finds, after months of probing, that there is a previously undiscovered way to break into a house without sounding an alarm. ''Governments are starting to say, 'In order to best protect my country, I need to find vulnerabilities in other countries,' '' said Howard Schmidt, a former White House cybersecurity coordinator. ''The problem is that we all fundamentally become less secure.'' A zero-day bug could be as simple as a hacker's discovering an online account that asks for a password but does not actually require typing one to get in. Bypassing the system by hitting the ''Enter'' key becomes a zero-day exploit. The average attack persists for almost a year -- 312 days -- before it is detected, according to Symantec, the maker of antivirus software. Until then it can be exploited or ''weaponized'' by both criminals and governments to spy on, steal from or attack their target. Ten years ago, hackers would hand knowledge of such flaws to Microsoft and Google free, in exchange for a T-shirt or perhaps for an honorable mention on a company's Web site. Even today, so-called patriotic hackers in China regularly hand over the information to the government. Now, the market for information about computer vulnerabilities has turned into a gold rush. Disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. consultant who leaked classified documents, made it clear that the United States is among the buyers of programming flaws. But it is hardly alone. Israel, Britain, Russia, India and Brazil are some of the biggest spenders. North Korea is in the market, as are some Middle Eastern intelligence services. Countries in the Asian Pacific, including Malaysia and Singapore, are buying, too, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. To connect sellers and buyers, dozens of well-connected brokers now market information on the flaws in exchange for a 15 percent cut. Some hackers get a deal collecting royalty fees for every month their flaw is not discovered, according to several people involved in the market. Some individual brokers, like one in Bangkok who goes by ''the Grugq'' on Twitter, are well known. But after the Grugq spoke to Forbes last year, his business took a hit from the publicity, according to a person familiar with the impact, primarily because buyers demand confidentiality. A broker's approach need not be subtle. ''Need code execution exploit urgent,'' read the subject line of an e-mail sent from one contractor's intermediary last year to Billy Rios, a former security engineer at Microsoft and Google who is now a director at Cylance, a security start-up. ''Dear Friend,'' the e-mail began. ''Do you have any code execution exploit for Windows 7, Mac, for applications like Browser, Office, Adobe, SWF any.'' ''If yes,'' the e-mail continued, ''payment is not an issue.'' For start-ups eager to displace more established military contractors, selling vulnerabilities -- and expertise about how to use them -- has become a lucrative opportunity. Firms like Vupen in Montpellier, France; Netragard in Acton, Mass.; Exodus Intelligence in Austin, Tex.; and ReVuln, Mr. Auriemma's and Mr. Ferrante's Maltese firm, freely advertise that they sell knowledge of the flaws for cyberespionage and in some cases for cyberweapons. Outside Washington, a Virginia start-up named Endgame -- in which a former director of the N.S.A. is playing a major role -- is more elusive about its abilities. But it has developed a number of tools that it sells primarily to the United States government to discover vulnerabilities, which can be used for fighting cyberespionage and for offensive purposes. Like ReVuln, none of the companies will disclose the names of their customers. But Adriel Desautels, the founder of Netragard, said that his clients were ''strictly U.S. based'' and that Netragard's ''exploit acquisition program'' had doubled in size in the past three years. The average flaw now sells from around $35,000 to $160,000. Chaouki Bekrar, the founder of Vupen, said his company did not sell to countries that are ''subject to European Union, United States or United Nations restrictions or embargoes.'' He also said revenue was doubling every year as demand surged. Vupen charges customers an annual $100,000 subscription fee to shop through its catalog, and then charges per sale. Costs depend on the sophistication of the vulnerability and the pervasiveness of the operating system. ReVuln specializes in finding remote vulnerabilities in industrial control systems that can be used to access -- or disrupt -- water treatment facilities, oil and gas pipelines and power plants. ''They are engaging in willful blindness,'' said Christopher Soghoian, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. Many technology companies have started ''bug bounty'' programs in which they pay hackers to tell them about bugs in their systems rather than have the hackers keep the flaws to themselves -- or worse, sell them on the black market. Nearly a decade ago the Mozilla Foundation started one of the first bounty programs to pay for bugs in its Firefox browser. Since then, Google, Facebook and PayPal have all followed suit. In recent months, bounties have soared. In 2010, Google started paying hackers up to $3,133.70 -- the number is hacker code for ''elite'' -- for bugs in its Web browser Chrome. Last month, Google increased its cash prize to $20,000 for flaws found in some of its widely used products. Facebook began a similar program in 2011 and has since paid out $1 million. (One payout included $2,500 to a 13-year-old. The most it has paid for a single bug is $20,000.) ''The program undermines the incentive to hold on to a bug that might be worth nothing in a day,'' said Joe Sullivan, Facebook's chief security officer. It had also had the unintended effect of encouraging ethical hackers to turn in others who planned to use its bugs for malicious use. ''We've seen people back-stab other hackers by ratting out a bug that another person planned to use maliciously,'' he said. Microsoft, which had long resisted such a program, did an about-face last month when it announced that it would pay hackers as much as $150,000 for information about a single flaw, if they also provided a way to defend against it. Apple still has no such program, but its vulnerabilities are some of the most coveted. In one case, a zero-day exploit in Apple's iOS operating system sold for $500,000, according to two people briefed on the sale. Still, said Mr. Soghoian of the A.C.L.U., ''The bounties pale in comparison to what the government pays.'' The military establishment, he said, ''created Frankenstein by feeding the market.'' In many ways, the United States government created the market. When the United States and Israel used a series of flaws -- including one in a Windows font program -- to unleash what became known as the Stuxnet worm, a sophisticated cyberweapon used to temporarily cripple Iran's ability to enrich uranium, it showed the world what was possible. It also became a catalyst for a cyberarms race. When the Stuxnet code leaked out of the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant in Iran in the summer of 2010, the flaws suddenly took on new value. Subsequent discoveries of sophisticated state-sponsored computer viruses named Flame and Duqu that used flaws to spy on computers in Iran have only fueled interest. ''I think it is fair to say that no one anticipated where this was going,'' said one person who was involved in the early American and Israeli strategy. ''And today, no one is sure where it is going to end up.'' In a prescient paper in 2007, Charlie Miller, a former N.S.A. employee, described the profitable alternatives for hackers who may have otherwise turned their information about flaws over to the vendor free, or sold it for a few thousand dollars to programs like Tipping Point's Zero Day Initiative, now run by Hewlett-Packard, which used them to enhance their security research. He described how one American government agency offered him $10,000 for a Linux bug. He asked another for $80,000, which agreed ''too quickly,'' Mr. Miller wrote. ''I had probably not asked for enough.'' Because the bug did not work with a particular flavor of Linux, Mr. Miller eventually sold it for $50,000. But the take-away for him and his fellow hackers was clear: There was serious money to be made selling the flaws. At their conventions, hackers started flashing signs that read, ''No more free bugs.'' Hackers like Mr. Auriemma, who once gave away their bugs to software vendors and antivirus makers, now sound like union organizers declaring their rights. ''Providing professional work for free to a vendor is unethical,'' Mr. Auriemma said. ''Providing professional work almost for free to security companies that make their business with your research is even more unethical.'' Experts say there is limited incentive to regulate a market in which government agencies are some of the biggest participants. ''If you try to limit who you do business with, there's the possibility you will get shut out,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''If someone comes to you with a bug that could affect millions of devices and says, 'You would be the only one to have this if you pay my fee,' there will always be someone inclined to pay it.'' ''Unfortunately,'' he said, ''dancing with the devil in cyberspace has been pretty common.'' "
China Denies Spying on European Diplomats,"China on Tuesday denied allegations that it was responsible for computer breaches at the foreign ministries of five European countries.  The denial, reported by Xinhua, China's official news agency, came in response to a report from FireEye, a computer security company in California. FireEye said it had traced a series of computer attacks against foreign ministers since 2010 to Chinese hackers. FireEye did not pinpoint where in China the attacks had originated, but security experts said the list of targets suggested state-sponsored hacking. The nations were Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia and Portugal. ""U.S. computer security firms have been keen on playing up the so-called cyberthreat from China,"" said Hong Lei, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, according to the Xinhua report. ""But their so-called evidence is never solid but widely doubted by professionals."" Mr. Hong added, ""They are trying to gain attention with fake facts, which will neither be conducive to international cybersecurity cooperation nor the professional qualifications and reputation of the firms involved.""  "
Target's Nightmare Goes On: Encrypted PIN Data Stolen," After hackers stole credit and debit card records for 40 million Target store customers, the retailer said customers' personal identification numbers, or PINs, had not been breached. Not so.   On Friday, a Target spokeswoman backtracked from previous statements and said criminals had made off with customers' encrypted PIN information as well. But Target said the company stored the keys to decrypt its PIN data on separate systems from the ones that were hacked. ""We remain confident that PIN numbers are safe and secure,"" Molly Snyder, Target's spokeswoman said in a statement. ""The PIN information was fully encrypted at the keypad, remained encrypted within our system, and remained encrypted when it was removed from our systems."" The problem is that when it comes to security, experts say the general rule of thumb is: where there is will, there is a way. Criminals have already been selling Target customers' credit and debit card data on the black market, where a single card is selling for as much as $100. Criminals can use that card data to create counterfeit cards. But PIN data is the most coveted of all. With PIN data, cybercriminals can make withdrawals from a customer's account through an automatic teller machine. And even if the key to unlock the encryption is stored on separate systems, security experts say there have been cases where hackers managed to get the keys and successfully decrypt scrambled data. Even before Friday's revelations about the PIN data, two major banks, JPMorgan Chase and Santander Bank both placed caps on customer purchases and withdrawals made with compromised credit and debit cards. That move, which security experts say is unprecedented, brought  complaints from customers trying to do last-minute shopping in the days leading to Christmas. The Target breach,from Nov. 27 to Dec. 15, is officially the second largest breach of a retailer in history. The biggest was a 2005 breach at TJMaxx that compromised records for 90 million customers. The Secret Service and Justice Department continue to investigate.  "
"As Hacking Continues, Concerns Grow That Chinese-Americans May Suffer","BEIJING - As tensions build between Washington and Beijing over cyberattacks, with a growing body of evidence that much of the hacking is coming from China and that the United States is a major target, as The New York Times has reported, are Chinese-Americans feeling the pressure? Are they concerned that growing suspicions about China's intentions toward the United States may cause them to suffer greater discrimination? Even as I was interviewing Frank H. Wu, a prominent Chinese-American and legal scholar, on this topic Thursday morning, reports were coming in from South Korea of cyberattacks there that disabled banks and broadcasters. Some reports said the attacks may have originated from a Chinese server. (Mr. Wu, dean of the Hastings College of the Law at the University of California, has written books on race and human rights and is a member of the Committee of 100, an influential Chinese-American group that seeks ""to encourage constructive relations between the peoples of the United States and Greater China,"" as it says on its Web site. He spoke from San Francisco via Skype. Mr. Wu, who was born in the United States, describes himself as a ""loyal American."")  Of course, the reports of the possible involvement of a China-based server do not necessarily mean that China was behind the attack in South Korea. In fact, as my colleague Choe Sang-Hun wrote from Seoul, the greatest suspicion rests on North Korea. But it served to highlight the issue since South Korea is a U.S. ally and North Korea is close to China, while some North Korean hackers are believed to be close to Chinese hackers. The rhetoric over hacking is growing tougher, with the White House demanding that the Chinese government stop the widespread theft of data from American computer networks and agree to ""acceptable norms of behavior in cyberspace,"" as my colleagues Mark Landler and David E. Sanger reported. So how does a prominent Chinese-American view the issue? Here are edited excerpts from my interview with Mr. Wu:  Q.   How do you understand what's going on here with this cyberhacking situation?  A.   The threat of cyberattack is very serious and it's difficult for lay people to understand the technological aspects of course, but it's easy enough to grasp the basic idea: that people who are up to no good are choosing high-tech tools essentially to break into secure systems of major American corporations and even possibly the U.S. government. The Chinese aspect of the threat appears now to be reasonably well documented. Not all attacks are coming from China; some may be coming from Russia or Iran or elsewhere, some may be from the U.S., some may be teenagers who have no particular purpose. But there seems to be enough evidence that some significant part of the cybersecurity threat emanates from China, and there are very strong hints that it is not just teenagers out to have fun, but that it may well be an organized effort, possibly with relationships to Chinese government entities, so this is of course very worrisome.  Q.  : Do you feel the cybersecurity issue is having an impact on Chinese-Americans, or could it in the future?  A.   Thank goodness in the current controversy there has not yet been very much racial imagery or stereotyping. The cyberthreat however is the perfect scenario for scapegoating a Chinese-American. It's perfect because China looms large as an economic or even military threat in the eyes of many Americans, and cyberattack fits perfectly with the stereotype of Chinese and Asians generally as not only untrustworthy, but also technologically talented. If you had to pick an image of how an Asian nation might attack the United States, technology would be an image that comes to mind easily.  Q.   What can Chinese-Americans do to counter the development of a negative perception?  A.   Actually Chinese-Americans are the perfect community for the U.S. to rely on in responding to these issues. The Committee of 100 was formed in the belief that Chinese-Americans are uniquely situated in a bridge-building role, as people with Chinese ancestry with some understanding of Chinese culture but as loyal American citizens. That combination allows people to be citizen diplomats, to facilitate understanding, to help ensure that dialogue is possible and remains productive and thoughtful. For Chinese-Americans, there is a long history of doubt about their loyalty, though there have been Chinese-Americans in the U.S. in significant numbers starting as early as the 1830s. ... There are fifth-generation Chinese-Americans, Chinese-American blacks and Mexicans. Starting in the 1980s, so maybe a generation after the laws [ending ethnic discrimination in immigration, in 1965] were passed, a mainland Chinese influx began. And that's altogether a different population. So Chinese migration to the U.S. has come in different waves with different identities and into different Americas. You know, America has become multicultural. Today there is no single Chinese-American community. Chinese-Americans form very many separate communities, partly based on  Mandarin or Cantonese, partly based on whether they're professional or working-class, still based on people's views about Communism.  Q.  What's your message to the hackers?  A.   Chinese hackers should not be doing what they're doing. I doubt that the opinions of Chinese-Americans will influence them. They probably are only barely aware of the existence of Chinese-Americans. But on cybersecurity, if I were to generalize, I would say the Chinese-American view of cybersecurity is quite similar to the general American view. Chinese attacks on U.S. institutions through the Internet and other technological means should stop. But Chinese-Americans have a particular concern, different from other Americans. That concern is that Chinese-Americans, regardless of their loyalty or how many generations their families have been in the U.S., or how assimilated they are, will be blamed wrongly for the actions of foreign individuals with whom we have no relationship.

Anonymous Payment Schemes Thriving on Web,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Eight years ago, Ernie Allen, the head of the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, called the heads of major banks and credit card companies. Why, he wanted to know, were they letting child pornographers move illicit profits through their systems? And so began a collaboration between his organization, major banks, credit card companies, Internet service providers, payment processors, and Internet companies like Google and Microsoft. They had hoped to follow the money and quash child pornography for good.  But at some point the money trail went cold. For the last year, Mr. Allen has been working with global law enforcement and financial leaders to find out why. He may be getting closer to an answer. Today, cybersecurity experts say billions of dollars made from child pornography and illicit sales of things like national secrets and drugs are being moved through anonymous Internet payment systems like Liberty Reserve, the currency exchange whose operators were indicted Tuesday for laundering $6 billion. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, described it as the largest online money-laundering case in history. ''What we have concluded is that illegal enterprises -- commercial child pornography, human trafficking, drug trafficking, weapons trafficking and organized crime -- has largely moved to an unregulated system that is not connected to any central bank or national authority,'' Mr. Allen said. ''The key to all of this has been anonymity.'' Liberty Reserve was shut down last weekend, but cybersecurity experts said it was just one among hundreds of anonymous Internet payment systems. They said online systems like the Moscow-based WebMoney, Perfect Money, based in Panama, and CashU, which serves the Middle East and North Africa, require little more than a valid e-mail address to initiate an account. The names and locations of the actual users are unknown and can be easily fabricated. And they worry that the no-questions-asked verification system has created a safe harbor for illicit activity. ''There are a multitude of anonymous payment systems out there, similar to Liberty Reserve, of which there are over one hundred,'' said Tom Kellermann, a vice president at the security company Trend Micro. ''Many pretend to 'know your customer' but do not actually do due diligence.'' Representatives for WebMoney, Perfect Money and CashU did not return e-mailed requests for comment. Currency exchanges like Liberty Reserve do not take or make payments of actual cash directly. Instead, they work with third parties that take payments and, in turn, credit the Liberty Reserve account. After the authorities went after Liberty Reserve, underground forums buzzed with comments from people mourning the potential loss of frozen funds and others offering alternatives, including Bitcoin, the peer-to-peer payment network started in 2009 to offer a decentralized way to create and transfer electronic cash around the world. In closed underground Russian-language forums, one person wrote, ''I had almost 6k there. Where to now?'' Another suggested, ''Maybe another alternative is Perfect Money? I wonder if Bitcoin exchange rate will go up or not.'' Indeed, the value of the Bitcoin virtual currency spiked temporarily on news of the Liberty Reserve shutdown. But law enforcement officials say Liberty Reserve operated with more anonymity than Bitcoin. Unlike Liberty Reserve and other anonymous payment systems, Bitcoin transactions are stored in a public ledger, called a block chain, that make it possible to trace Bitcoin transactions even years after the fact. ''You can track specific Bitcoin movements just as you would the serial number on a U.S. dollar,'' said Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin developer. The real concern, security experts say, are private payment services that claim to do due diligence, but do not do even the most basic verification. Typically, money transfers are subject to strict regulation, which include maintaining customer identification records, filing suspicious activity reports, mandatory reporting on large currency transfers, and ''know-your-customer requirements.'' But security experts say there are a multitude of anonymous payment systems that require no customer identification and have little capability to detect or report suspicious activities. ''You would think they would be regulated but there is no regulation,'' Mr. Kellermann said. Of online payment processors, PayPal is considered the gold standard. The company, now owned by eBay, has payment experts to ensure PayPal is compliant with ''know-your-customer'' regulations and with law enforcement agencies in each country in which it operates. ''It's unfortunate that as many of these new services come on board, it's the people looking to abuse them who are the first to use them,'' said Anuj Nayar, a spokesman at PayPal. ''There's a lot more than just having the right technology in place to be an efficient global payment processor.'' In March, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCen, began applying anti-money laundering rules to virtual currencies, amid worries that new forms of cash purchased on the Web, like Bitcoin, were being used to finance illicit enterprises. While Bitcoin is just a software system, there are multiple gateways and exchange points that allow Bitcoin owners to exchange their Bitcoins for cash. Federal authorities recently seized accounts associated with a United States intermediary of Mt. Gox, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, because it was not FinCen compliant. That, and other exchanges in the United States are now racing to be fully compliant with ''know-your-customer laws'' and anti-money laundering requirements. Mr. Allen said he believed that was a good first step. ''With anonymous payment systems, tracking has become virtually impossible,'' he said. ''How do you prevent these kinds of problems when you are dealing with an unregulated currency, monitored by nobody? The answer, I think, is there has to be some kind of structure.'' "
Cybersecurity: A View From the Front,"HELSINKI -- The changes in the digital world today represent a dramatically sped-up version of the changes the world underwent in a century of industrialization. It is a paradigm transformation of our world: Notions of a nation's size, wealth, power, military might, population and G.D.P. mean something altogether different from what they meant a generation ago. These relations are in constant flux, and old assumptions no longer hold. Today, a small, poor East European country can be a world leader in e-governance and cybersecurity. In February, the United Nations praised Estonia's e-Annual Report system, by which entrepreneurs can submit annual reports electronically, as the ''best of the best'' e-Government application of the past decade. Last autumn, Freedom House ranked Estonia first in Internet freedom for the third year in a row (the United States and Germany were second and third).  At the same time, Estonia is also remembered as the first publicly known target of politically motivated cyberattacks in April 2007, which inundated the Web sites of Parliament, banks, ministries, television stations and other organizations. Disruptive as the attacks were, they were by today's standards primitive, consisting of ''distributed denial of service'' attacks (DDoS), which essentially overload servers with signals from hijacked, hacker-controlled PCs. Six years later, as computing power and IT dependency have increased hugely, cyberattacks are far more sophisticated and our vulnerabilities are far greater. Yet those attacks were a blessing -- Estonia took cybersecurity seriously earlier than most. In 2008, NATO opened its Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence, to enhance NATO's cyberdefense capability, in Tallinn. Cybersecurity needs to be taken seriously by everyone. We continue to think of cyberthreats in military or classical warfare terms, when in fact cyber can simply render the military paradigm irrelevant. The whole information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructure must be regarded as an ''ecosystem'' in which everything is interconnected. It functions as a whole; it must be defended as a whole. Today, almost everything we do depends on a digitized system of one kind or another. Our critical infrastructure -- our electrical, water or energy production systems and traffic management -- essentially interacts with, and cannot be separated from, our critical information infrastructure -- private Internet providers, lines of telecommunications and the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (Scada) systems that run everything from nuclear power plants to delivery of milk to our supermarkets. Understanding that cybersecurity means defending the entirety of our societies, we need to re-examine many assumptions of security. In cyberwarfare, it is much harder to identify the attacker, and therefore to know how to retaliate. In a modern digitalized world it is possible to paralyze a country without attacking its defense forces: The country can be ruined by simply bringing its Scada systems to a halt. To impoverish a country one can erase its banking records. The most sophisticated military technology can be rendered irrelevant. In cyberspace, no country is an island. This requires rethinking some of our core philosophical notions of modern society: the relations between the public and private spheres, between privacy and identity. At a time when the greatest threats to our privacy and the security of our data come from criminal hackers and foreign countries (often working together), we remain fixed on the idea that Big Brother, our own government, is the danger. This may have been true in the past, when only national governments had the ability to monitor citizens. Today, as we know, a single hacker can access the most intimate details of your digital and nondigital life, your finances and your correspondence. This is a clear case of market failure. A bank that builds identity theft and fraud into the cost of doing business is an example of market failure. A power company that treats a cyber-induced power outage as an act of God, no different from a tornado or earthquake, demonstrates market failure. If the private sector is unwilling to take the necessary steps to guarantee the integrity of its online activities, the government must step in to fulfill its most fundamental task -- to ensure the security of its citizens; that is, to provide them with a secure identity. Identity lies at the core of security online. Virtually all breaches of computer security involve a fake identity, be it stealing a credit card number or accessing the internal documents of the European Commission. A three-digit security code on the back of a credit card does not provide you with a secure identity, nor does an ordinary computer password. The fundamental question is whether you can be sure the person you interact with online is who he claims he is. The key to all online security is a secure online identification system. But a nebulous fear of an imagined Big Brother prevents citizens in many places from adopting a smart-chip-based access key that would afford them secure online transactions. In Estonia, the government has become the guarantor of secure transactions online, while identity is authenticated by a body independent of the government. We use a two-factor identification system in which the ID is protected by both a chip and a password. A binary key or public key infrastructure guarantees securely encrypted transfer of information. Thus far, our system has proved secure. Even during the DDoS attacks of 2007, our digital government system remained online and intact. Precisely because we offer a verifiable and reliable identification system, Estonia has gone further than any other country in investing in digitizing the basic processes of society. A quarter of the electorate votes online; 95 percent of tax returns are done online, and 95 percent of prescriptions are filled online. By the end of 2012, Estonians gave more than a hundred million digital legal signatures. Citizens, as legal owners of their own data, have access to their digital medical and dental records. And we have more and more e-services available every year. In the future, we hope to connect our digital services and make them interoperable with our neighbors in Northern Europe. In the longer run, we're looking toward uniting systems in all of Europe. Ultimately, government data will move across borders as freely as e-mail and Facebook and follow the international flows of commerce and trade. The job of cybersecurity is to enable a globalized economy based on the free movement of people, goods, services, capital and ideas. This can only be accomplished if identities are secure. Undoubtedly the most effective means by which our societies could be safeguarded from cyberattacks would be to roll back the clock -- to go back to the pen, typewriter, paper and mechanical switch. We should give up on mobile phones, iPads, online banking, social media, Google searches -- everything we have become accustomed to in the modern world. But that won't happen. Cybersecurity is not just a matter of blocking bad things a cyberattack can do; it is protecting all the good things that cyberinsecurity can prevent us from doing. Genuine cybersecurity should not be seen as an additional cost, but as an enabler, guarding our entire digital way of life. Toomas Hendrik Ilves is the president of Estonia. He is speaking Friday at the Forum for New Diplomacy hosted in Paris by the International Herald Tribune and the Académie Diplomatique Internationale. "
Daily Report: Chinese Army Unit Is Tied to Hacking Against U.S.,"A growing body of digital forensic evidence - confirmed by American intelligence officials who say they have tapped into the activity of the army unit for years - leaves little doubt that an overwhelming percentage of the attacks on American corporations, organizations and government agencies originate in and around the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army in Shanghai.  David E. Sanger, David Barboza and Nicole Perlroth of The New York Times report that an unusually detailed 60-page study, to be released Tuesday by Mandiant, an American computer security firm, tracks for the first time individual members of the most sophisticated of the Chinese hacking groups - known to many of its victims in the United States as ""Comment Crew"" or ""Shanghai Group."" ""Either they are coming from inside Unit 61398,"" said Kevin Mandia, the founder and chief executive of Mandiant, in an interview last week, ""or the people who run the most-controlled, most-monitored Internet networks in the world are clueless about thousands of people generating attacks from this one neighborhood.""  Other security firms that have tracked ""Comment Crew"" say they also believe the group is state-sponsored, and a recent classified National Intelligence Estimate, issued as a consensus document for all 16 of the United States intelligence agencies, makes a strong case that many of these hacking groups are either run by army officers or are contractors working for commands like Unit 61398, according to officials with knowledge of its classified content.  Increasingly its focus is on companies involved in the critical infrastructure of the United States - its electrical power grid, gas lines and waterworks. According to the security researchers, one target was a company with remote access to more than 60 percent of oil and gas pipelines in North America.  The United States government is planning to begin a more aggressive defense against Chinese hacking groups, starting on Tuesday. Under a directive signed by President Obama last week, the government plans to share with American Internet providers information it has gathered about the unique digital signatures of the largest of the groups, including Comment Crew and others emanating from near where Unit 61398 is based.

Cyberattacks a Topic in Obama Call With New Chinese President,"Cyberthreats featured prominently in President Obama's congratulatory call to the new Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Thursday. The president used the occasion to discuss the loss of United States intellectual property from cyberattacks. The mere mention of cyberthreats is a step forward for an administration that has been reluctant to confront Beijing on Chinese military attacks even as billions of dollars' worth of trade secrets have been stolen.  But a spate of recent headlines about Chinese cyberattacks on The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and others have thrust the issue on the diplomatic stage.  A report by Mandiant, a computer security firm, tying hundreds of attacks back to one Chinese military unit, made the issue even harder to ignore. Mr. Obama has been increasingly vocal about cyberthreats, but has not gone as far as to call out China by name. In his State of the Union address, he was careful to omit China when he said ""we know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets."" And when the Obama administration sent the nation's Internet providers a confidential list of Internet addresses tied to a hacking group that had stolen terabytes of data from American corporations, it failed to mention that every single address could be traced to the Chinese military cybercommand. But privately, administration officials have said they plan to tell China's new leaders that the volume and sophistication of Chinese cyberattacks have become so intense that they threaten the relationship between Washington and Beijing. ""In any discussion with China, the U.S. needs to have three agenda items: One, cybersecurity; two, cybersecurity; and three, cybersecurity,"" Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview. China has long denied that it is responsible for cyberattacks on American companies and has said that it too is a victim of such attacks. And in discussions with American officials, Chinese representatives often refuse to discuss economic espionage. ""They say that the topic of economic espionage is 'embarrassing' for them,"" said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has participated in such discussions. ""They say, 'In the US, military espionage is heroic and economic espionage is a crime, but in China, the line is not so clear.'""  "
"Daily Report: Snowden Trained as Hacker While With N.S.A., Résumé Says","In 2010, while working for a National Security Agency contractor, Edward J. Snowden learned to be a hacker, Christopher Drew and Scott Shane report in The New York Times. He took a course that trains security professionals to think like hackers and understand their techniques, all with the intent of turning out ""certified ethical hackers"" who can better defend their employers' networks. But the certification, listed on a résumé that Mr. Snowden later prepared, would also have given him some of the skills he needed to rummage undetected through N.S.A. computer systems and gather the highly classified surveillance documents that he leaked last month, security experts say.  Mr. Snowden's résumé, which has not been made public and was described by people who have seen it, provides a new picture of how his skills and responsibilities expanded while he worked as an intelligence contractor. Although federal officials offered only a vague description of him as a ""systems administrator,"" the résumé suggests that he had transformed himself into the kind of cybersecurity expert the N.S.A. was desperate to recruit, making his decision to release the documents even more embarrassing to the agency. ""If he's looking inside U.S. government networks for foreign intrusions, he might have very broad access,"" said James A. Lewis, a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The hacker got into the storeroom."" Mr. Snowden prepared the résumé shortly before applying for that job, while he was working in Hawaii for the N.S.A. with Dell, the computer maker, which has intelligence contracts. Little has been reported about his four years with Dell, but his résumé, as described, says that he rose from supervising computer system upgrades for the spy agency in Tokyo to working as a ""cyberstrategist"" and an ""expert in cyber counterintelligence"" at several locations in the United States.

"Swindles and Spam, Lurking in Your Search Results","Most of our ventures onto the Web still begin with a search -- a fact readily exploited by spammers and swindlers who rely on excessive use of keywords, link exchanging and other manipulation techniques to push their content higher in the list of search results, hoping you will click on them. Though the major search engines discourage such deception, that hasn't stopped companies from engaging in such practices -- and fooling users in the process. Even someone with decades of search expertise, like Duane Forrester, a senior product manager at Bing, can fall victim to a Web scam.  ''I was looking to buy a new lens for a digital camera, and I found a store that had one for $200 less than everyone else,'' Mr. Forrester said. ''Turns out the store was a fly-by-night shop out of the U.K. that sold broken products. I called the company and got my refund, but I still fell into the pothole.'' Millions of ''dirty'' sites litter the Web. The Web security firm Blue Coat Systems concluded in its 2012 security report that search engines topped the list of spam entry points, before e-mail and other sources. At a minimum, off-topic spam results are a nuisance. More perniciously, spammers can infect computers with malware and phish for sensitive personal data like credit card information. Here are some ways to avoid search spam. LEARN TO SPOT SPAM Mastering the art of smarter searching won't always shield you from getting spammed. That is why, as a first step, you should look before you click. Don't assume that the top results are the most useful or even the safest. Look at the letters that follow the period at the end of a Web address. Top-level domains like .com and .info, as well as top-level country code domains like .fr (for France) are prime targets for spammers. One reason is that spammers know that spelling mistakes happen. It's common to forget the ''o'' in a dot-com search, for instance. So if you want a site that ends in .com, but mistakenly type in .cm (the country code for Cameroon), you might get spam instead of the page you wanted. Many sites will also take advantage of Web address shorteners like Bitly to direct you to an unsavory source. So be cautious about clicking those truncated URLs as well. Both Google and Bing tip searchers off to potentially unsafe sites, wherever possible. If a search engine warns you that a site is potentially unsafe, browse at your own risk. And as Mr. Forrester's tale shows, a site that is offering discounts that appear too good to be true may indeed be offering deals too good to be true. In addition, before making any purchase on a lesser-known site, take a look around. Do you see a listed address? If so, map it. Look for the e-mail address. If your only contact option is a Gmail or Yahoo account, something may be awry. A site's language, too, may be a giveaway, especially when you are conducting a local search. Flagrant grammar and spelling errors may signal that the owner is based elsewhere. And if you spot the term ''free'' scrawled across a Web site, proceed with caution. SOME SITES ARE RISKIER It is important to know what separates a potential spam site from a harmless one. The difference may be counterintuitive. For example, pornography domains may be safer to browse than some mainstream content. According to Cisco's 2013 annual security report, ''online advertisements are 182 times more likely to deliver malicious content than pornographic sites.'' Matt Cutts, who heads the Web spam team at Google, said this was because pornography sites were well monitored. ''People who run porn sites are tech-savvy, and they pay a lot of attention to visitors, so they notice unusual things quickly,'' he said. Though a search result may be safe, it may not be useful. A prime example is Yahoo Answers. The community-driven site consistently ranks high across the major engines on question-related queries. But the quality of its answers varies greatly and the site is often more useful for a chuckle than legitimate insight. Learn to spot and selectively skip these sites. Similarly, instructional sites like eHow may place a higher premium on quantity over quality content, so you might not find exactly what you are searching for there. Be wary of Web pages that oversell you on their supposed legitimacy. One Better Business Bureau logo is fine. A series of logos promoting a site's professionalism or expertise is a red flag. Almost anyone with rudimentary Photoshop skills can create and attach fake logos on to a site. You can crosscheck any awards by going to the source. It is also a good idea to check whether a Web site is certified. The Department of Homeland Security offers more information on this. SOME SEARCHES ATTRACT SPAM Some searches are more enticing to spammers than others. Credit report queries are a top target. Remember, there are only three major national credit agencies. If you are using an outside party to check credit reports, do so carefully. Be extra cautious when conducting travel and insurance searches. Some sites create travel tips for the express purpose of drawing you into their hotel or other travel-related business. It is best to seek out travel information from a more trusted site. Search results for lyrics, videos and screen savers also pose an increased risk. For example, pages with downloadable content, like those offering ring tones, provide an enticing built-in audience for spammers because the user is actively looking to install software. When you search also matters. Spammers tend to come out in force on Cyber Monday and other big shopping periods. Nor is spam limited to text. A site with many broken image links may be designed that way intentionally. It is easier to sell an outdated model if customers don't see the product. Use a reverse image search service like TinEye to find out if an image has been pulled from another site. BEEF UP YOUR BROWSER As the search leader, Google is targeted more than any other engine. Chrome users can install a spam extension that lets users identify potential spam sites and block them from their search results by clicking on a ''spam'' text link next to each result. You can also change your Google ad settings and opt out of the company's advertising cookies. SEEK OUT CUSTOM ENGINES Another way to avoid getting spam -- and to get more relevant results -- is to go directly to a specialized search engine, where the results are already filtered for your query. You could go to Google Books for book searches and know you will more likely get book results for ''The Great Gatsby,'' say, and not offers for ''Gatsby'' T-shirts. There are also engines like Science.gov and Scirus -- both useful for science-related queries. Another valuable specialized engine is iSEEK Education. Lastly, you can use the image service Picsearch to filter photo searches. "
Details Emerge About Syrian Electronic Army's Recent Exploits,"At The Onion it's all fun and games, except when the company's Twitter account gets hacked. This week, after the parody site became the latest publication to have its Twitter account hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army, The Onion took a more serious note, explaining in a detailed blog post how the company's account was hacked, and warning others how to avoid the exploit. In the blog post, Onion engineers explained that the company's Twitter account was hacked using a basic phishing exploit, where a false e-mail redirected people to a fake Web site which then asked for Google Apps credentials.  ""At least one Onion employee fell for this phase of the phishing attack,"" the company said. Exposing details about an attack is not the normal approach companies take after they are hacked. The New York Times revealed earlier this year how Chinese hackers breached its systems, but that was an anomaly. Most companies fear what such disclosures will do to their reputations, or their stock price. The Associated Press, for example, has remained silent after its Twitter account was hijacked and a fake message was posted about explosions at the White House. In recent attacks on The A.P., Human Rights Watch, and the Onion, the group used sophisticated ""spearphishing""attacks to break into each organization. Employees received similarly worded e-mails, asking them to click on a fake news article that then redirected them to a fake Google Mail or Microsoft Webmail site where they were asked to re-enter their username and password. The hackers used their login credentials to send e-mails to other employees from their inboxes until they found people with access to the organization's social media accounts. Once inside those people's inboxes, the hackers reset their Twitter passwords, giving them exclusive access to the account, until Twitter could suspend it. In the case of The A.P., a single Tweet was sufficient to nearly crash the stock market. One  hacker, who identifies himself only by his hacker handle Th3 Pr0, said the group attacked The A.P. because the Syrian Electronic Army believed the United States was ""supporting the terrorist groups in Syria"" and because the United States had seized its Web domains. Th3 Pr0 said the group was able to trick more than 50 A.P. employees to click on its malicious link, including a handful of the organization's social media editors. Th3 Pr0 sent The New York Times several screenshots taken during the AP attack to prove the Syrian Electronic Army, or S.E.A., was behind it. Security researchers tracking the hackers also confirmed the group was responsible. According to forensics reports, several recent  Twitter hacks by the group, including an attack on Human Rights Watch last March and The Onion this week, were orchestrated from the same Internet addresses in Russia. But they believe those addresses are a proxy that masks the true origin of the attacks, which they say, is in Syria. ""From examining the details of this incident, as well as those effecting The A.P., Guardian and others, it's clear that the S.E.A. is not using complex methods of attack,"" The Onion's tech team wrote. ""All of the hacks so far have been a result of simple phishing, or possibly dictionary attacks - all of which are preventable with a few simple security measures."" Among the tactics that can be used to ward off attacks, the engineers note that people should be aware of suspicious links and setting up a Twitter account on a different e-mail address than the one belonging to your organizations. But The Onion has also managed to have a little fun at its own expense this week posting a satirical article on its hacking, titled: ""Onion Twitter Password Changed To OnionMan77: 'That Ought To Do It,' Company Sources Confirm."" Then it posted another piece making fun of the hackers.  "
Hacker Case Leads to Calls For Better Law,"Matthew Keys, the 26-year-old deputy social media editor at Reuters charged with assisting computer hackers, has emerged as the latest lightning rod in the continuing battle between proponents of Internet freedom and the Justice Department. A federal indictment of Mr. Keys filed in California on Thursday met an online cacophony of protests against the 1984 computer crime law under which he was charged, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The indictment says that Mr. Keys, who previously worked as a Web producer at KTXL Fox 40, a Sacramento-based television station that, like The Los Angeles Times, is owned by the Tribune Company, provided a user name and password to hackers associated with the group Anonymous. Those hackers then changed a headline on a Times online article from ''Pressure Builds in House to Pass Tax-Cut Package'' to ''Pressure Builds in House to Elect CHIPPY 1337,'' a reference to another hacking group. Each of the three charges against Mr. Keys could result in fines of as much as $250,000, with possible prison terms of as many as five years in one count and as many as 10 in the other two. The Tribune Company spent more than $5,000 to update its systems in response to the attack, the indictment says.  The aggressive tactics by prosecutors come amid an uptick in prominent cyberattacks in recent months. Last week, President Obama met with chief executives to discuss online security, which has become a hot issue on Capitol Hill. In Mr. Keys's case, the scale of the potential punishment relative to the actual harm caused -- the vandalism to the Web site was quickly fixed -- raised comparisons to the potential sentence in the indictment of Aaron Swartz, a 26-year-old computer programmer and Internet freedom advocate. Accused of breaking into a university system to download an archive of scholarly papers, Mr. Swartz committed suicide in January. ''Anyone horrified by the amount of jail time'' Mr. Keys faced should join in calling for Congressional reform of the computer fraud act, Trevor Timm, an advocate and blogger at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that supports an open Internet, wrote in a Twitter post on Thursday. Still, it is not clear that an overhaul of the fraud act would change the damage charges Mr. Keys is facing. Orin S. Kerr, a former computer crimes prosecutor who now is a legal scholar at George Washington University, said that the part of the fraud act covering damage to a computer, which Mr. Keys was accused of violating, was more straightforward than the part involving authorized access, which Mr. Swartz was charged with violating; some scholars, including Mr. Kerr, have called those provisions overbroad. Moreover, several legal specialists said that even if Mr. Keys were convicted on all three charges, they most likely would be collapsed into a single offense for purposes of calculating a sentence since they involved the same basic conduct. The sentencing guidelines would then be consulted in light of Mr. Keys's previous criminal history, if any, and the economic harm caused by the vandalism -- including any overtime or outside consultants piad to audit the system after the intrusion was discovered. Mark Eckenwiler, a former deputy chief of the Justice Department's computer crime section, said that statutory maximums cited in department news releases are ''purely theoretical'' in most cases, and that it would be inappropriate for the department to speculate at the start of the case about what an eventual sentence would be. ''The truth is that a lot of first-time offenders may well come in the very bottom band'' of the sentencing guidelines, he said. Nevertheless, Mr. Keys's defense team stoked the furor. ''I think hackers are the new Communists for the D.O.J.,'' Tor Ekeland, a Brooklyn-based lawyer representing Mr. Keys, said in an interview. He maintained his client's innocence and said that he intended to ''vigorously litigate'' the charges. Jay Leiderman, a criminal defense lawyer in Ventura, Calif., known for representing computer hackers affiliated with Anonymous, is also representing Mr. Keys. The case against Mr. Keys struck a particular nerve because of his outsize, and outspoken, online presence. A popular and at times volatile figure in the world of social media, Mr. Keys is in many ways emblematic of the new-media landscape. The writer of what was described by Time magazine as one of the 140 best Twitter feeds, Mr. Keys quickly used his feed to discuss the indictment and assure his nearly 25,000 Twitter followers that he was ''fine.'' Mr. Keys is among a coterie of young journalists adept at social media who see their stars rise quickly and often are snapped up by major media organizations, said Sree Sreenivasan, chief digital officer at Columbia. ''At a young age you can have more influence than at any time in journalistic history,'' Mr. Sreenivasan said, adding, ''and the mistakes you make at a younger age are more visible than ever before.'' A Thomson Reuters spokesman said on Friday that Mr. Keys had been suspended with pay. ''Any legal violations, or failures to comply with the company's own strict set of principles and standards, can result in disciplinary action,'' the company said in a statement, adding that Mr. Keys joined Reuters in 2012; the apparent crimes occurred in December 2010. Supporters of Mr. Keys echoed criticism that reached a high pitch in January, when online activists accused prosecutors of trying to bully Mr. Swartz into pleading guilty. An article in Slate was posted on Friday under the headline ''Has the Justice Department Learned Anything from the Aaron Swartz Case?'' Last week Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. was questioned at a Congressional oversight hearing on whether there had been prosecutorial misconduct in the Swartz case. Mr. Holder called the case tragic but defended prosecutors' conduct, noting that they had offered Mr. Swartz several versions of a plea deal that would involve only a few months of prison time. ''I don't look at what necessarily was charged as much as what was offered in terms of how the case might have been resolved,'' Mr. Holder said. Mr. Kerr, the former prosecutor, said the Justice Department had noted the maximum statutory punishments in news releases in part for their deterrent effect -- to dissuade others from committing similar crimes -- and not because they were realistic. ''It's mostly for show,'' Mr. Kerr said. Anonymous, the global collective of loosely organized ''hacktivists'' who have used computer attacks to protest political causes, has recently faced particular scrutiny. In August, Higinio O. Ochoa III, a member of an offshoot of Anonymous, was sentenced to two years in prison after he pleaded guilty to defacing Web sites and stealing confidential data when he tapped into several law enforcement computers. In 2011, hackers associated with the group targeted the Sony Corporation's PlayStation online network, costing the company around $171 million. ''They're an organization that should be taken seriously, and anyone who is thinking about their network and their security should consider them a force to be reckoned with,'' said Edward Schwartz, chief security officer for RSA, the security arm of the EMC Corporation. ''There are three categories of hackers: Russian criminals trying to rob us blind; the Chinese who are trying to steal our secrets; and then there's Anonymous, and a lot of them are like merry pranksters,'' said Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at the electronic security firm Sophos. He added: ''We're treating them all the same.'' According to the F.B.I., Mr. Keys went by the name ''AESCracked'' and in Internet chat rooms offered hackers access to the Fox 40 computer systems and e-mail addresses. ''That was such a buzz having my edit on the LA Times,'' a user named ''sharpie'' suspected of being associated with Anonymous wrote, according to the indictment. Mr. Keys is said to have responded, ''Nice.'' When compared with recent attacks by Chinese hackers on media organizations including The New York Times, Mr. Keys's apparent crime is ''nothing,'' said Josh Shaul, chief technology officer at Application Security Inc., a New York-based provider of database security software. ''It's like someone handed you the keys to a building and you used them to get in.'' "
Daily Report: Bank Hackers Used Data Centers to Supercharge Attacks,"There was something disturbingly different about the wave of online attacks on American banks in recent weeks, report Nicole Perlroth and Quentin Hardy of The New York Times. Security researchers say that instead of exploiting individual computers, the attackers engineered networks of computers in data centers.  The skill required to carry out attacks on this scale has convinced United States government officials and security researchers that they are the work of Iran, most likely in retaliation for economic sanctions and online attacks by the United States. ""There is no doubt within the U.S. government that Iran is behind these attacks,"" said James A. Lewis, a former official in the State and Commerce Departments and a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  American officials have not offered any technical evidence to back up their claims, but computer security experts say the recent attacks showed a level of sophistication far beyond that of amateur hackers. Also, the hackers chose to pursue disruption, not money: another earmark of state-sponsored attacks, the experts said.  How, exactly, attackers are hijacking data centers is still a mystery. Making matters more complex, they have simultaneously introduced another weapon: encrypted DDoS attacks. Banks encrypt customers' online transactions for security, but the encryption process consumes system resources. By flooding banking sites with encryption requests, attackers can further slow or cripple sites with fewer requests.    Researchers at Radware who investigated the attacks for several banks found that the traffic was coming from data centers around the world. They discovered that various cloud services and public Web hosting services had been infected with a particularly sophisticated form of malware, called Itsoknoproblembro, that was designed to evade detection by antivirus programs. The malware has existed for years, but the banking attacks were the first time it used data centers to attack external victims. Botnets, or networks of individual infected slave computers, can typically be traced back to a command and control center, but security experts say Itsoknoproblembro was engineered to make it very difficult to tie it to one party. Security researchers have come up with a new name for servers infected with Itsoknoproblembro: they call them ""bRobots.""   "
Daily Report: Many of Web's Encryption Tools Compromised by N.S.A.," The National Security Agency is winning its long-running secret war on encryption, using supercomputers, technical trickery, court orders and behind-the-scenes persuasion to undermine the major tools protecting the privacy of everyday communications in the Internet age, according to newly disclosed documents, Nicole Perlroth, Jeff Larson and Scott shane report.  The agency has circumvented or cracked much of the encryption, or digital scrambling, that guards global commerce and banking systems, protects sensitive data like trade secrets and medical records, and automatically secures the e-mails, Web searches, Internet chats and phone calls of Americans and others around the world, the documents show. Many users assume - or have been assured by Internet companies - that their data is safe from prying eyes, including those of the government, and the N.S.A. wants to keep it that way. The agency treats its recent successes in deciphering protected information as among its most closely guarded secrets, restricted to those cleared for a highly classified program code-named Bullrun, according to the documents, provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor. Beginning in 2000, as encryption tools were gradually blanketing the Web, the N.S.A. invested billions of dollars in a clandestine campaign to preserve its ability to eavesdrop. Having lost a public battle in the 1990s to insert its own ""back door"" in all encryption, it set out to accomplish the same goal by stealth. The agency, according to the documents and interviews with industry officials, deployed custom-built, superfast computers to break codes, and began collaborating with technology companies in the United States and abroad to build entry points into their products. The documents do not identify which companies have participated. The N.S.A. hacked into target computers to snare messages before they were encrypted. In some cases, companies say they were coerced by the government into handing over their master encryption keys or building in a back door. And the agency used its influence as the world's most experienced code maker to covertly introduce weaknesses into the encryption standards followed by hardware and software developers around the world.

"After N.S.A. Disclosures, Yahoo Moves to Encrypt Internal Traffic","Thanks to the revelations of Edward Snowden, technology companies are feverishly enabling new security features in an effort to assure users, particularly abroad, that they are doing everything possible to secure their data from hackers and the National Security Agency.  On Monday, Yahoo's chief executive, Marissa Mayer, said Yahoo had plans to add extra levels of security to the company's business operation. ""As you know, there have been a number of reports over the last six months about the U.S. government secretly accessing user data without the knowledge of tech companies, including Yahoo,"" Ms. Mayer wrote. ""I want to reiterate what we have said the past: Yahoo has never given access to our data centers to the NSA or any other government agency. Ever."" Both Yahoo and Google secure their data centers with full-time security details and state-of-the-art heat sensors, video cameras and, even in some cases, iris scanning technology. When servers at Google pass their prime, employees bludgeon them with steel pistons and put them through industrial shredders before recycling them, to ensure no data is left behind. But that data flows from center to center on fiber optic cables owned by Internet backbone providers - and that, Google executives believe, is where intelligence agencies are tapping them. Even before Mr. Snowden began releasing classified materials to journalists last June, Google grew suspicious that outsiders could tap its traffic between data centers and began encrypting that traffic. After the Snowden revelations, Google said it was accelerating those efforts. On Monday, Ms. Mayer said Yahoo now planned to follow suit and encrypt the user traffic flowing between its data centers in 2014. ""As we have said before, we will continue to evaluate how we can protect our users' privacy and their data,"" Ms. Mayer said.  "
China and Cyberwar,"Despite denials from Beijing, there seems little doubt that China's computer hackers are engaged in an aggressive and increasingly threatening campaign of cyberespionage directed at a range of government and private systems in the United States, including the power grid and telecommunications networks.  The Obama administration had carefully avoided naming a specific culprit. Now it has. In the Pentagon's annual report to Congress on China, the Chinese government and, in particular, the Chinese military are explicitly accused of mounting attacks on United States government computer systems and defense contractors in a systematic effort to steal intellectual property and gain strategic advantage. The report adds urgency to talks expected to begin in July with the Chinese about cyberissues. It does not discuss America's own considerable investment in disruptive computer capabilities. These, too, must be on the agenda. China's ambitions have been discussed on a background basis by senior officials and were the subject of an earlier report by the computer security firm Mandiant that was disclosed by The Times in February. The new report to Congress adds depth and detail. Its clear purpose is to increase pressure on China to rein in its hackers, who Mandiant has said, are largely run by Chinese Army officers or are contractors working for military commands. But for anyone broadly interested in the possibility of a global disruption caused by government-directed hackers, the report suffers from one conspicuous omission: It does not address America's own role in the expanding world of cyberwarfare nor that of other countries with active programs, like Russia, Britain and Israel. The report said that the primary goal of China's cyberattacks on the United States was to steal industrial technology but that many intrusions were designed to obtain insights into American policy makers' thinking. The report also warned that information gathered on American defense networks, logistics and military capabilities could be exploited during a crisis. The United States has spent billions of dollars defending its computer networks, as it should. But, increasingly, it is also investing billions more in offensive capabilities, including malware that can disrupt an adversary's networks like the American-Israel Stuxnet virus did to Iran's nuclear program in 2010. Cyber is one of the few growth areas in the military budget; Congress and the Obama administration will need to take care that the Pentagon is not exploiting the China threat to boost the budget even more to make up for other reductions. One positive development is that China, after considerable resistance, now seems willing to discuss cyberissues with the United States. The Americans seem intent on keeping the focus on persuading Chinese officials to end attacks on commercial and economic interests and to understand that, if they don't, it would damage relations with the United States. It would be a mistake not to also engage China, and other countries as well, on military-related issues, including what constitutes cyberaggression and how governments should respond. The world does not need a cyber arms race. "
An American Cyberoperations Offensive,"WASHINGTON -- Newly disclosed budget documents for America's intelligence agencies show how aggressively the United States is now conducting offensive cyberoperations against other nations, even as the Obama administration protests attacks on American computer networks by China, Iran and Russia. The documents, obtained by The Washington Post from Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, and described by the paper in its Saturday editions, indicate 231 such operations in 2011, a year after the first evidence emerged of an American- and Israeli-led cyberattack against Iran's nuclear-enrichment center.  That number suggests that President Obama was not deterred by the disclosure of the Iranian operation, which became evident because of a technological error, and is pressing ahead on using cyberweapons against a variety of targets. The Post did not publish the documents. Last week, it said it had withheld most of the 178 pages of documents at the request of government officials because of the sensitivities of the spying operations they describe. Unlike drone attacks, which the administration has begun to acknowledge publicly and provide legal justifications for, cyberattacks are still regarded as part of a secret arsenal that officials will not discuss. The attacks described in the budget documents appear to be on a far smaller scale than the series of attacks on Iran, which were part of a classified operation called Olympic Games. The Post reported a parallel effort, code-named GENIE, which it described as an effort by American intelligence officials working for the N.S.A. and the military's Cyber Command to insert surreptitious controls into foreign computer networks. That computer code, a form of malware, allows American officials to hijack the computers or route some of their data to servers that enable American espionage. It is unclear how many, if any, of those 231 operations were merely for espionage or data manipulation, and how many may have been intended to destroy or disable infrastructure. Computerized espionage is not new, though the sophistication and scale of it has increased in recent years. Offensive operations intended to alter data, turn off networks or destroy machines -- which is what made the Iran operation so complex and unusual -- are a far newer phenomenon. President Obama, in an executive order signed last year, has reserved the right to decide when the United States should conduct such operations. It is not clear how many of the 231 he approved. Diplomatically, the disclosure of the latest Snowden documents poses a new challenge to Mr. Obama. He has pressed China to cease its own cyberoperations in the United States, many of which are aimed at the theft of intellectual property including corporate secrets and the plans for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the country's most expensive new weapons system. The Chinese have responded that America also conducts extensive cyberoperations, including against China, and will doubtless use the most recent disclosures to press that case. So far, Mr. Obama's effort to get the Chinese engaged in a deeper dialogue on cyberissues has yielded discussions, but little fruit. The Pentagon has insisted that the United States does not engage in economic espionage, the specialty of Chinese forces like Unit 61398, a People's Liberation Army operation behind many of the intrusions into American systems. But it does conduct what specialists call ''network exploitation,'' which it distinguishes from ''attacks,'' to obtain military or intelligence secrets and intercept cell and digital communications. Attacks, at least as defined by the military, would involve destruction of computer equipment or the facilities those networks run. The Post said a budget document defined network exploitation as ''surreptitious virtual or physical access to create and sustain a presence inside targeted systems or facilities.'' That appears to be part of the offensive operations, and can often pave the way to ''facilitate future access,'' the document said. The documents indicate that the N.S.A. spent $25 million on ''covert purchases of software vulnerabilities.'' These are often flaws in commercial software, often in the near-ubiquitous Windows operating system, that make it possible to secretly enter and manipulate data. The bulk of the work inside the N.S.A. is conducted by the Tailored Access Operations group, one of the most secretive units in a secretive agency. Recently, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, who directs the N.S.A. and commands the military's Cyber Command, spoke publicly of creating 40 cyberteams, including 13 focused on offensive operations. The defensive operations include protections for the American military and other government agencies, and efforts to detect broad cyberattacks launched on the United States. "
Cyberwar: How Digital Threats Are Redefining National Security," Overview | Can a nation's military or economic institutions be toppled with a few anonymous keystrokes? That's the fear being voiced by United States government officials and corporations, who have drastically ramped up their preparations in recent months to defend against attacks on computer networks. In the activities that follow, students learn about the scope of recent attacks and what is being done to counter such threats. Then they consider the broader practical and ethical consequences of preparing for cyberwar.  Materials | Markers and Post-it notes or index cards with tape for groups of four or five students; a computer with an Internet connection and a projector to display articles and video; computers with an Internet connection for individual students or groups to use online resources; copies of articles or primary documents as needed.  Warm-Up | Tell students:    Today we are going to look at a type of conflict that is brand new. Some people call it a war, but it has nothing to do with guns and bullets, only computers. Any guesses what I'm talking about?  Write student brainstorming on the board, focusing on terms like ""cyberwar"" and ""hacking.""  How many of you have heard of a recent incident in the news in which someone maliciously used computers to harm someone else? Can you think of any examples?  Record any incidents students may have heard of, like recent Internet slowdowns or attacks on corporate Web sites.  Imagine, for a moment, if a malicious hacker or unfriendly government were able to create a computer virus that took down the world's computer networks for a day or even longer. What sorts of activities would suddenly become impossible?  Help students to brainstorm a comprehensive list of computer-related activities in modern life, including not just things like shopping but essential functions like air traffic control, banking records, power grids, weather forecasting and satellite communications.  Over the next couple of days we are going to take a close look at how we might protect ourselves from such attacks, while at the same time continuing to enjoy the amazing opportunities provided by computers and the Internet. But first, let's read a recent article that shows you just how seriously people are treating this problem.   Related  | In ""Security Leader Says U.S. Would Retaliate Against Cyberattacks,"" Mark Mazzetti and David E. Sanger write about how United States government officials are warning that a significant attack on the nation's computer systems could wreak havoc with basic services and the economy. Officials are preparing to fight back against attacks that are seen as potentially more pressing than the threat posed by global terrorist networks. The chief of the military's newly created Cyber Command told Congress ... that he is establishing 13 teams of programmers and computer experts who could carry out offensive cyberattacks on foreign nations if the United States were hit with a major attack on its own networks, the first time the Obama administration has publicly admitted to developing such weapons for use in wartime.  ""I would like to be clear that this team, this defend-the-nation team, is not a defensive team,"" Gen. Keith Alexander, who runs both the National Security Agency and the new Cyber Command, told the House Armed Services Committee. ""This is an offensive team that the Defense Department would use to defend the nation if it were attacked in cyberspace.""   Background Vocabulary: Read the entire article with your class, then answer the questions below. You may wish to introduce students to the following words or concepts before reading: cyberattacks, cyberspace, infrastructure, espionage, utilities, rhetoric, propaganda.  Questions | For reading comprehension and discussion:   Activity | In this activity, student groups will read additional articles on recent cyberattacks and work together to construct a class ""action-and-reaction timeline"" (PDF).  Part I: Reading a Times Article and Tracking Cyberattacks Set up a vertical timeline on a whiteboard, with the years 2007 through 2013 arranged on the vertical (left) axis from bottom to top, and the terms ""action"" and ""reaction"" on the horizontal (top) axis. Then divide students into mixed ability groups of four or five and give each group a small stack of Post-it notes or index cards with tape.  Assign one of the articles about a cyberattack that has occurred in recent years from the list below to each group. In some cases, the article might mention more than one attack, and in some cases it might also say what happened next - what steps people took in reacting to the attack.  Within each group, students should have different roles: a facilitator to lead the group's discussion, a recorder to take notes on what the group discusses and note takers who keep track of specific cyberattacks on Post-it notes or index cards. For each cyberattack or incident a group finds in its article, students should fill out a note card. On the top they should write the country and approximate date in large letters (example, ""fall 2012"" or ""September 2012""). Below, students should provide details describing briefly what happened. Groups should complete as many cards as they can.  After groups finish taking notes, students should place their note cards in the appropriate spot in the ""action"" column on the timeline handout (PDF), the chalkboard or even via computer using Google Docs or other file-sharing programs.  Part II: Group Discussion Next, students should discuss the cyberattacks they found as a group and try to figure out the consequences:  Students should think creatively and list as many consequences as they can in the group's notes. They should also make sure they can also locate any countries mentioned on a world map (PDF).  Part III: Class Presentations and Analysis In the final portion of class, ask each group to briefly present their findings - what happened and any consequences - and locate any countries mentioned on a world map. Teachers can jot down key points on the timeline in the ""reaction"" column as they speak. After all the groups have presented, ask the class to think once more about the cumulative impact or consequences of such attacks. How have they changed the global climate around cybersecurity and Internet use, and what should be done now?  Going Further: Teaching About Cyberwar   1. Is the threat real or hyped? Last year, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned of a possible ""cyber-Pearl Harbor"" in which hackers or governments launched multiple, simultaneous attacks on the United States. Are you persuaded of the severity of that threat, or do you believe it is overstated? Read Mr. Panetta's account of the dangers, and then read these articles that critique the notion that the United States is on the verge of cyberwar. Write a personal response, citing evidence from articles you have read to support your position as well as countervailing views.   2. What are America's rules governing cyberwar? Under the United States Constitution, only Congress can declare war, and under the 1973 War Powers Act the president must consult with legislative leaders when emergencies make that impossible. Does that apply to cyberwar too? Read this article on the Obama administration's assertion of broad executive powers to strike pre-emptively or take other steps in cyberrelated emergencies. Then consider this response, which describes the government's position as a ""power grab."" Which position do you consider more persuasive?  Write a scenario in which you describe how a cyberattack might unfold, explaining how Congressional involvement is either possible or impractical. Then propose a new federal law, the Cyberwar Powers Act, that spells out exactly how the government can protect itself from cyberthreats while remaining true to its democratic principles.  3. Did the United States set a bad example? As early as 2006, the United States was taking active steps to use cyberwarfare tools against Iran, and in 2011 it contemplated launching a full-scale cyberattack against Libya. Do you believe some acts of cyberwar might be justified in order to prevent or limit the loss of life in a real war? Or will such acts come back to haunt the country that uses them first, leading to a cycle of retaliation and chaos that hurts everyone? Write a proposed international treaty governing cyberwarfare in which you spell out the conditions, if any, under which such tactics are justified.  4. Are the United States and China cyberrivals? In February, a United States company and government officials implicated units of the Chinese Army in a broad range of cyberattacks, including some against The New York Times. How has the United States government responded, and has it acted forcefully enough? Read the articles below, listing the steps that have been taken to eliminate the problem. Then explain why United States officials are treading carefully and might be reluctant to go too far or start an overt cyberwar with China.   5. What is the best response to cyberthreats: offense, defense or clever thinking? Imagine that President Obama has convened an emergency committee of representatives from the military, Internet businesses, other businesses like banks and power companies that rely on the Internet, bloggers devoted to maintaining Internet freedom and ordinary citizens. Assign students to take on one of these roles and, using the sources below or others from the archives of The New York Times, argue for the best long-term strategy for protecting the United States and other nations from cyberattack. Hold a formal debate with student presentations and a final class vote on the best strategy.   6. What can the private companies or individuals do? Often it is private companies involved in the Internet business that notice and act on problems first. Now governments in both the United States and United Kingdom are taking active steps to increase cooperation with private industry.  Do you think government, private companies and individuals would cooperate or come into conflict in the event of cyberwar? Make a prediction now, citing examples to support your view. Then track continuing coverage in the coming weeks, designing a poster that shows how the relationship between government and the private sector veers between conflict and cooperation on this issue.

Adobe Hacking Attack Was Bigger Than First Thought,"An online attack at Adobe compromised personal data for tens of millions more customers than was previously reported, the company acknowledged on Tuesday. Earlier this month, Adobe said that hackers had gained access to credit card information and other personal data for 2.9 million of its customers. The company said hackers had also stolen an undisclosed number of Adobe usernames and encrypted passwords. On Tuesday, that tally of stolen usernames and passwords had grown to more than 38 million records.  Adobe said that number included expired and invalid usernames and encrypted passwords, but did not give an exact count for how many were still active. Heather Edell, an Adobe spokeswoman, said the company had reset passwords for affected accounts and notified all 38 million affected users. Previously, Adobe said hackers had also stolen source code to three of its most widely used products: Acrobat, ColdFusion and ColdFusion Builder, which are run on personal computers and business servers around the world. On Tuesday, Adobe acknowledged that part of the source code for Photoshop, its widely used photo editing software, had also been taken. While Adobe said stolen passwords were encrypted, security experts say that encryption typically delays but does not outright prevent hackers from cracking passwords and selling them on auction-like black market sites where a single password can fetch $20. To crack passwords, hackers regularly exploit extensive online databases of common passwords and as many as 50 million so-called hash values. Others will use ''rainbow tables,'' which list encrypted values for nearly every alphanumeric character combination up to a certain length. ''Cyberattacks are one of the unfortunate realities of doing business today,'' Adobe's chief security officer, Brad Arkin, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. ''Given the profile and widespread use of many of our products, Adobe has attracted increasing attention from cyberattackers.'' In a financial filing last September, Adobe acknowledged that the company was a regular target for online theft, and that loss of proprietary information could ''result in litigation and potential liability or fines for us, governmental inquiry and oversight, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business.'' Adobe said its investigation of the attack was incomplete. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Java Flaw In Browsers Is Discovered, Then Patched","6:53 p.m. | Updated Oracle fixed a security flaw in its Java software on Sunday, after the Department of Homeland Security warned users to disable Java software completely, citing a security hole that allows hackers to take control of their machines.  ""Java 7 Update 10 and earlier contain an unspecified vulnerability that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system,"" the agency said in an alert issued last week. ""This and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered."" A European security researcher who blogs under the name Kafeine first discovered the vulnerability and posted it to his blog on Thursday. The homeland security agency said that it had confirmed that Microsoft Windows, Apple's Mac OS X and Linux platforms were all affected and that it was ""unaware of a practical solution to this problem."" In a rare alert on Thursday evening, the agency recommended that users disable Java in their Web browsers. On Sunday, Oracle released a patch for the security hole. Apple stopped shipping its computers with Java enabled last year, largely because of security concerns, but said it was remotely disabling the Java 7 plug-in on Macs where it had already been installed. Windows and Linux users can disable Java by following this guide on java.com. Oracle did not return a request for comment on Sunday. Java, a widely used programming language that runs on more than 850 million personal computers, has been the source of security problems before. Last April, hackers exploited a Java vulnerability to infect more than half a million Apple computers with a vicious form of malware in what was the largest-scale attack on the OS X operating system to date. A month later, the Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks cyber threats, discovered that hackers had used a Java security hole to infect visitors to several foreign policy Web sites, including the Web sites of the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, Amnesty International Hong Kong and the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The exploit was particularly disconcerting because it let attackers download a malicious program onto its victims' machines without prompting. Users did not even have to click on a malicious link for their computers to be infected. The program simply downloaded itself. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
A Hacking At Apple,"Cyberattacks, apparently, happen in threes. After Facebook and Twitter announced that they were breached by sophisticated hackers in recent weeks, Apple said it had been attacked, too, in a rare admission for the technology giant. In a statement to reporters Tuesday, Apple said some of its computers were infected with the same malware that hit Twitter and Facebook. Like Facebook, Apple confirmed that its employees' computers were infected with malware when they visited a Web site for software developers. Neither company has named the Web site. But according to a person with knowledge of Facebook's investigation, the compromised site, iPhonedevsdk, an online forum for software developers, is still infected. (In other words, unless you want to be owned by hackers, do not visit the site.) ''We identified a small number of systems within Apple that were infected and isolated them from our network,'' Apple said in a statement. ''There is no evidence that any data left Apple. We are working closely with law enforcement to find the source of the malware.''  Twitter said attackers may have briefly gained access to data for 250,000 user accounts and that it reset passwords for and alerted users whose data may have been vulnerable. Facebook said that no user data was taken in its attack. Both companies said that they were also working with law enforcement to trace the source of the attacks, which they described only as ''sophisticated.'' In all three cases, the attackers exploited a well-known security hole in Oracle's Java software. Java, a widely used programming language, is installed on more than three billion devices. It has long been hounded by security problems. Last month, after a French security researcher and blogger named Kafeine exposed a serious vulnerability in the software, the Department of Homeland Security issued a rare alert that warned users to disable Java on their computers. The vulnerability was particularly disconcerting because it let attackers download a malicious program onto its victims' machines without any prompting. Users did not even have to click on a malicious link, they only had to visit an infected site for their computers to get infected. After Oracle initially patched the security hole in January, the Department of Homeland Security said that the fix was not sufficient and recommended that, unless it was ''absolutely necessary'' to use Java, users should disable it on their computers completely. Oracle did not issue another fix until Feb. 1. Apple said on Tuesday that it was releasing an updated Java malware removal tool that will check Macs for malware and remove it if found. But security researchers say the Java exploit only gave hackers a foothold into these companies' systems, and that the companies should be more forthcoming with what the attackers did once inside. ''Why is nobody asking what the payload is?'' Sean Sullivan, a security adviser at the Finnish antivirus company F-Secure tweeted. ''The Java exploit only opened the door. What walked in?'' @nickbilton Facebook developers use MACS. Why is nobody asking what the payload is? The Java exploit only opened the door. What walked in? -- Sean Sullivan (@5ean5ullivan) February 15, 2013 Social networks are a prime target for hackers, who look to use people's personal data and particularly their social connections in what are known as ''spearphishing'' attacks. In this type of attack, a victim is sent an e-mail, ostensibly from someone they know on Facebook or other social networking site, containing a malicious link or attachment. Once the link is clicked or attachment opened, attackers take control of a user's computer. If the infected computer is inside a company's system, the attackers are able to gain a foothold. In many cases, they then extract passwords and gain access to sensitive data. In an article published Monday evening, The New York Times reported that one group of Chinese cyberattackers, which has been tied to a specific military unit of China's People's Liberation Army, leveraged the social connections of its targets to send malicious e-mails that eventually allowed them to compromise thousands of organizations, ranging from Coca-Cola to the International Olympic Committee. Hackers have been attacking organizations inside the United States at an alarming rate. The number of attacks reported by government agencies last year topped 48,500 -- a ninefold jump from the 5,500 attacks reported in 2006, according to the Government Accountability Office. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Department of Homeland Security: Disable Java 'Unless It Is Absolutely Necessary',"Even after Oracle fixed a serious security flaw in its Java software on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security warned that the fix was not sufficient and urged users to disable Java on their Web browsers.  ""Unless it is absolutely necessary to run Java in Web browsers, disable it,"" the agency said in an updated alert on Monday. ""This will help mitigate other Java vulnerabilities that may be discovered in the future."" Oracle, which develops Java software, was forced to fix the security hole Sunday after the department issued this rare alert late Thursday: ""Java 7 Update 10 and earlier contain an unspecified vulnerability that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. This and previous Java vulnerabilities have been widely targeted by attackers, and new Java vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered."" Oracle has not answered repeated requests for comment. Java, a widely used programming language, is installed on more than three billion devices running under various operating systems and has long been dogged by security problems. In a report, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian antivirus company, said that half of all cyberattacks last year were caused by Oracle's Java software. ""While we called 2011 the year of the vulnerability, 2012 can justifiably be described as the year of the Java vulnerability, with half of all detected exploit-based attacks targeting vulnerabilities in Oracle Java,"" Kaspersky Lab said in its security bulletin. Although hackers have historically exploited security holes in Adobe Systems, Windows and Internet Explorer in cyberattacks, last year, Java was used in the majority of attacks. Last April, hackers exploited a Java vulnerability to infect more than half a million Apple computers with a vicious form of malware in what was the largest-scale attack on the OS X operating system to date. The exploit was particularly disconcerting because it let attackers download a malicious program onto its victims' machines without prompting. Users did not even have to click on a malicious link for their computers to be infected. The program simply downloaded itself. The current loophole affects Apple's Mac OS X operating system, but also Microsoft Windows and Linux platforms. Apple no longer ships its machines with Java enabled by default, and moved quickly after the alert to disable the software remotely on machines where it had already been installed. Those who do not own Macs were left to manually disable Java software themselves. To disable Java on a Windows PC, go to the computer's control panel. Open the Java icon, click on the security panel and uncheck the box for ""enable Java content in the browser."" Oracle has more detailed instructions on its Java Web site.  "
Daily Report: Attacks Used the Internet Against Itself to Clog Traffic,"A huge denial-of-service attack that eventually slowed traffic across much of the Internet relied on vulnerabilities in the network's own hardware to amplify its effects, John Markoff and Nicole Perlroth report on Thursday in The New York Times.  The digital ""fire hose"" being wielded by the attackers to jam traffic on the Internet in recent weeks was made possible by both the best and worst aspects of the sprawling global computer network. The Internet is, by default, an open, loosely regulated platform for communication, but many of the servers that make its communication possible have been configured in such a way that they can be easily fooled. The latest attacks, which appeared to have subsided by Wednesday, have demonstrated just how big a problem that can be. On Tuesday, security engineers said that an anonymous group unhappy with Spamhaus, a volunteer organization that distributes a blacklist of spammers to e-mail providers, had retaliated with a cyberattack of vast proportions. In what is called a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack, the assailants harnessed a powerful botnet - a network of thousands of infected computers being controlled remotely - to send attack traffic first to Spamhaus's Web site and later to the Internet servers used by CloudFlare, a Silicon Valley company that Spamhaus hired to deflect its onslaught. This kind of attack works because the botnet exploits Internet routing software and fools Internet servers into responding to requests for information sent simultaneously by a large group of computers. The Internet servers that answer the requests are tricked into sending blocks of data to the victims, in this case Spamhaus and CloudFlare. The attack was amplified because each of the servers in this case was asked to send a relatively large block of information. The data stream grew from 10 billion bits per second last week to as much as 300 billion bits per second this week, the largest such attack ever reported, causing what CloudFlare estimated to be hundreds of millions of people to experience delays and error messages across the Web. On Wednesday, CloudFlare described the highly technical game of cat-and-mouse between itself and Spamhaus's opponents that has played out over the course of the last nine days. After the attackers discovered that they could not disable CloudFlare, which had been hired by Spamhaus to absorb its attack traffic, they changed their strategy.  "
Malware That Drains Your Bank Account Thriving On Facebook,"In case you needed further evidence that the White Hats are losing the war on cybercrime, a six-year-old so-called Trojan horse program that drains bank accounts is alive and well on Facebook.  Zeus is a particularly nasty Trojan horse that has infected millions of computers, most of them in the United States. Once Zeus has compromised a computer, it stays dormant until a victim logs into a bank site, and then it steals the victim's passwords and drains the victim's accounts. In some cases, it can even replace a bank's Web site with its own page, in order to get even more information- such as a Social Security number- that can be sold on the black market. The Trojan, which was first detected in 2007, is only getting more active. According to researchers at the security firm Trend Micro, incidents of Zeus have risen steadily this year and peaked in May. Eric Feinberg, founder of the advocacy group Fans Against Kounterfeit Enterprise (FAKE), has noticed an uptick in Zeus-serving malicious links on popular N.F.L. Facebook fan pages such as one created by a group called ""Bring the N.F.L. To Los Angeles."" Mr. Feinberg said he had noticed an increase in such pages and malicious links in recent weeks. He sent those links to Malloy Labs, a security lab, which confirmed that the links on these pages were serving up Zeus malware. The malware was being hosted from computers known to be controlled by a Russian criminal gang known as the Russian Business Network, which has been linked to various online criminal activities, ranging from malware and identity theft to child pornography. Mr. Feinberg said he has tried to alert Facebook to the problem, with increased urgency, but wasn't satisfied with their response. A Facebook spokesman directed this reporter to a previous Facebook statement reminding users that it actively scans for malware and offering users the opportunity to enroll in self-remediation procedures such as a ""Scan-And-Repair malware scan"" that can scan for and remove malware from their devices. Mr. Feinberg said that after-the-fact approach was hardly sufficient. ""If you really want to hack someone, the easiest place to start is a fake Facebook profile- it's so simple, it's stupid."" ""They're not listening,"" Mr. Feinberg added. ""We need oversight on this.""  "
Energy Department Is the Latest Victim of an Online Attack," The Energy Department was hit by an online attack last month that compromised the personal data of several hundred employees. In an e-mail sent to employees Friday evening, the agency confirmed that hackers penetrated computers and servers at the agency's Washington headquarters and stole the personal information of hundreds of employees and contractors. The agency said it was working with federal authorities to investigate the attack. It said that, based on its findings, ""no classified data was compromised."" The attack on the Energy Department is the latest in a string of major attacks to surface in the last week. Last week, after The New York Times reported that Chinese hackers had attacked its computers and stolen employee passwords, The Wall Street Journal said it had also been attacked. The Washington Post was also attacked by Chinese hackers last year, according to people with knowledge of The Post's investigation. And on Friday, Twitter announced that a group of sophisticated hackers had penetrated its systems, possibly stealing the personal information of 250,000 users.  ""We're seeing a widespread colonization of significant U.S. infrastructure,"" said Tom Kellermann, a vice president for cybersecurity at TrendMicro, a Tokyo-based security company. ""The level of organization and premeditation behind these attacks is really unprecedented."" William Gibbons, an Energy Department spokesman, did not say whether the agency had determined who was behind the attack. A person close to the investigation said the attack was unrelated to a separate incident last January when Anonymous, the loose hacking collective, dumped what appeared to be sensitive information from the Energy Department on Pastebin, a Web site frequently used by hackers. In that case, the data turned out to be more than two years old. A former Energy Department security employee told The Washington Free Beacon Monday morning that the agency made for an easy target. ""It's a continuing story of negligence,"" Ed McCallum, a former Energy Department security official, told the Free Beacon. Mr. McCallum said that the agency continued to have security issues despite the fact that it manages the most ""sophisticated military and intelligence technology the country owns."" Here is the e-mail that the Energy Department sent to its employees: The Department of Energy (DOE) has just confirmed a recent cyber incident that occurred in mid-January which targeted the Headquarters' network and resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of employee and contractor Personally IdentifiableInformation (PII). The Department is strongly committed to protecting the integrity of each employee's PII and takes any cyber incident very seriously. The Department's Cybersecurity Team, the Office of Health, Safety and Security and the Inspector General's office are working with federal law enforcement to promptly gather detailed information on the nature and scope of the incident and assess the potential impacts to DOE staff and contractors. Based on the findings of this investigation, no classified data was compromised. We believe several hundred DOE employees' and contractors' PII may have been affected. As individual affected employees are identified, they will be notified and offered assistance on steps they can take to protect themselves from potential identity theft. Once the full nature and extent of this incident is known, the Department will implement a full remediation plan. As more specific information is gathered regarding affected employees and contractors, the Department will make further notifications. The Department is also leading an aggressive effort to reduce the likelihood of these events occurring again. These efforts include leveraging the combined expertise and capabilities of the Department's Joint Cybersecurity Coordination Center to address this incident, increasing monitoring across all of the Department's networks and deploying specialized defense tools to protect sensitive assets. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and we all play an important role in maintaining the integrity and security of our networks. To help minimize impacts and reduce any potential risks, please keep the following best practices in mind: * Encrypt all files and emails containing PII or sensitive information, including files stored on hard drives or on the shared network.* Do not store or email non-government related PII on DOE network computers  "
Eavesdropping on Internet Communications,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation has a new plan to intercept Internet messages, calls and video chats. Instead of requiring companies like Skype and Google to build surveillance capabilities into their services as it suggested in 2010, the F.B.I. now proposes fining companies that fail to comply with court-ordered wiretaps.  The new approach has met less opposition from other agencies, like the Commerce Department, than the earlier plan, which went nowhere because some officials worried that it would hurt innovation by imposing expensive and technically difficult requirements on start-up Internet-based communication services. Fines, some officials believe, would be less of a burden on new businesses because they might not have to worry about developing the ability to conduct wiretaps right away. The White House is evaluating the plan for submission to Congress. The F.B.I. has long complained that it is becoming ever harder to carry out court-approved, real-time eavesdropping on criminal suspects since people are communicating without picking up a phone. The agency argues that the monitoring of Internet-based services does not expand government surveillance, but merely updates the current wiretap law. Judges would still have to authorize wiretaps, and would impose the fines if the services did not comply. But tech companies and advocates for greater privacy and security say the threat of fines would still force companies to build complex wiretapping capabilities into their services from the start (allowing wiretapping on peer-to-peer services like Skype will be particularly difficult). And they argue that opening systems to surveillance could make them vulnerable to hackers, a serious problem. Some experts say there are other ways to monitor suspects. A recent paper by four academics in the journal IEEE Security & Privacy argues that the government could get court orders to install software directly on the computers of suspects instead of going through Internet companies. The administration and Congress need to analyze carefully the F.B.I.'s proposal, details of which have not been made public. New rules will have to strike the right balance between privacy and cybersecurity and the government's need to monitor criminal activity. "
Google Employees Speak Out About Government Spying,"Google's canned responses to reports of government spying have ranged from ""concerned"" to ""outraged."" But some of its employees have been more outspoken. One of Google's top lawyers testified before Congress Wednesday about surveillance, demanding urgent reform of email privacy laws and warning of threats to the open Internet and to the United States economy. Meanwhile, Google engineers who work on security railed against the government online.  The backlash against government Internet surveillance could hurt the United States economy, partly because businesses and consumers could abandon United States cloud companies, said Richard Salgado, the director for law enforcement and information security at Google, in testimony before the Senate judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law. He cited studies like one from Forrester that predicted the cloud computing industry could lose $180 billion, 25 percent of its revenue, by 2016. Already, countries like Brazil are considering so-called data localization laws, which would require that all data related to Brazilian companies and citizens be stored in Brazil. This movement ""has gained considerable traction since the revelation of the Prism program,"" Mr. Salgado said, and added that companies like Google ""could be barred from doing business in one of the world's most significant markets."" There is also a movement to give control of the Internet to the United Nations or to individual governments, Mr. Salgado said, posing ""a significant threat to the free and open Internet."" Mr. Salgado, who previously worked in the Justice Department, pushed for reform of surveillance laws like the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which does not require a warrant to read e-mail more than 180 days old, giving it less protection than letters in a file cabinet. And he reiterated demands for the government to allow Google to publish details on the numbers of national security requests it receives. In an unofficial capacity, Google engineers have also spoken out. In a sharply worded post on Google Plus that included an unprintable profanity aimed at the National Security Agency, Brandon Downey, who has worked on Google security for a decade, wrote that while he had suspected government spying on Google users' data, the revelations saddened him. ""The U.S. has to be better than this; but I guess in the interim, that security job is looking a lot more like a Sisyphus thing than ever,"" Mr. Downey wrote. Mike Hearn, another Google security engineer, wrote that one of the leaked N.S.A. slides showed an anti-hacking system he worked on for two years. ""We designed this system to keep criminals out. There's no ambiguity here,"" he wrote. ""In the absence of working law enforcement, we therefore do what internet engineers have always done - build more secure software,"" he added.  An earlier version of this post misstated the first mention of several public Google Plus posts by Google engineers. Other people mentioned the posts online, before The Desk blog.   "
A Guide to Spying on Cisco Phone Calls," 7:35 p.m. | Updated  to remove an erroneous reference to a Java security flaw.  Governments are actively spying on people's smartphones. Your car's infotainment system can now be hacked. And cybercriminals are actively stealing credit card numbers from other cybercriminals.  These were among the uplifting subjects presented at this week's Kaspersky Annual Summit in San Juan, P.R. (Kaspersky Labs, the Russian company that holds the conference, requires that presenters take shots of rum after each talk, perhaps to deal with the stress). One of the scarier presentations was delivered by Ang Cui, a Columbia Ph.D. student, who demonstrated how to spy on calls made with Cisco's VoIP phone. Yes, that is the same phone pictured here next to President Obama aboard Air Force One. In Mr. Cui's presentation -- titled ""Just because you are paranoid doesn't mean your phone isn't listening to everything you say"" -- he demonstrated how to exploit a loophole in the phone's kernel, the core of its operating system that manages communication between a device's hardware and software. By doing so, Mr. Cui could spy on the phone remotely, turning it into a listening device. Using Google's voice-to-text translation feature, he demonstrated how he could transcribe any call and even search for keywords, like ""nuclear"" or ""missile strike."" ""There's no defense against this,"" Mr. Cui told the audience. ""Every single Cisco phone in the world has this vulnerability."" Mr. Cui and his adviser, Salvatore J. Stolfo, informed Cisco of the vulnerability last October. Two days later, Cisco confirmed the problem and within a week issued a fix. But almost immediately, Mr. Cui told Cisco he had found five ways around the patch. Three weeks later, on Nov. 20th, Cisco released a new patch. (Curiously, the patch was not available for download from Cisco's Web site. To get it, you had to call Cisco customer support and request the patch by name.) But once again, Mr. Cui found a way around it. Since then, Cisco seems to have given up, leaving 50 million of its phones vulnerable to spying. Cisco declined to comment. But in a statement last November it said: ""We can confirm that workarounds and a software patch are available to address this vulnerability, and note that successful exploitation requires physical access to the device serial port, or the combination of remote authentication privileges and non-default device settings."" Mr. Cui said he had been working on his own fix -- with funds from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA -- and plans to introduce it at the RSA security conference in San Francisco later this month. An earlier version of this post incorrectly associated Cisco with a security vulnerability recently discovered in the Java software. Java is owned by Oracle, not Cisco, and Oracle has fixed the flaw.   "
"Apple Says It Is ""Unaware"" of N.S.A. iPhone Hack Program","Apple said Tuesday that it was unaware of the National Security Agency's efforts to hack into the iPhone and has never facilitated agency efforts to install backdoors into its products.  The Cupertino, Calif., company released a strongly worded statement in response to a recent a recent article in the German magazine Der Spiegel, which reported that N.S.A. analysts refer internally to iPhone users as ""zombies"" who ""pay for their own surveillance."" ""Apple has never worked with the N.S.A. to create a backdoor in any of our products, including iPhone,"" an Apple spokeswoman said in an email. Der Spiegel released a number of slides detailing the agency's hacking division - known internally as the Tailored Access Operations, or T.A.O. division. One  slide, describing an N.S.A. software implant called DROPOUTJEEP, stood out. The agency described DROPOUTJEEP as a ""software implant for Apple iPhone"" that has all kinds of handy spy capabilities. DROPOUTJEEP can pull or push information onto the iPhone, snag SMS text messages, contact lists, voicemail and a person's geolocation, both from the phone itself and from cell towers in close proximity. It can also turn the iPhone into a ""hot mic"" using the phone's own microphone as a recording device and capture images via the iPhone's camera. (Reminder to readers: Masking tape is not a bad idea). But the Der Spiegel report is based on information that is over five years old. The slide, dated January 2007 and last updated October 2008, claims that the agency requires close physical proximity to the iPhone to install DROPOUTJEEP. ""The initial release of DROPOUTJEEP will focus on installing the implant via close access methods,"" the N.S.A. slide says.  Then, ""A remote installation capability will be pursued for a future release."" Based on the timing of the report, the agency would have been targeting Apple's iOS5 operating system. Apple released its latest iOS7 operating system last September. Nevertheless, privacy activists point outthat the agency's capabilities have expanded, if anything, over the last five years. ""Imagine what they have now,"" Christopher Soghoian, a technology adviser at the American Civil Liberties Union, posted on Twitter. Apple denied any involvement. ""We have been unaware of this alleged N.S.A. program targeting our products,"" Apple said in a statement. ""Our team is continuously working to make our products even more secure, and we make it easy for customers to keep their software up to date with the latest advancements."" The company added, ""Whenever we hear about attempts to undermine Apple's industry-leading security, we thoroughly investigate and take appropriate steps to protect our customers. We will continue to use our resources to stay ahead of malicious hackers and defend our customers from security attacks, regardless of who's behind them.""

Scientists Expand Scale Of Digital Snooping Alert,"Scientists reported on Wednesday that they had taken a step toward bringing improved security to computer networks, developing an encryption technique that will extend protection to a small group of computer users. The researchers at Toshiba's European research laboratory in Cambridge, England, in a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, wrote that they had figured out a way to allow a group of users to exchange encryption keys -- long numbers that are used to mathematically encode digital messages -- through an experimental technique known as quantum key distribution. The new technique is believed to be more practical and less expensive than existing technologies. It also extends the scale of the current quantum key systems to as many as 64 computer users from just two users.  The system does not prevent eavesdropping -- it simply serves as a kind of burglar alarm, alerting computer users that an outsider is listening to a transmission on an optical network. Nevertheless, the advance comes at a time of growing concern about the relative ease of breaching computer security, prompted by recent disclosures based on the documents leaked from the National Security Agency and the British Government Communications Headquarters intelligence agencies by Edward J. Snowden. One worry is that the initial exchange of the key material in modern encryption systems has become vulnerable. Today many digital encryption systems are based on the ability of two computer users to secretly exchange a ''key'' -- a large number, which is then used to establish a secure communication channel to exchange messages over a computer network. The encryption key is encoded in a special stream of photons or bits. The Toshiba work is based on the ability to make the infinitesimally short time measurements required to capture pulses of quantum light hidden in streams of photons transmitted over fiber optic links -- and to do that in a network of dozens of users. The key exchange is usually protected by the use of mathematical formulas based on the challenge of factoring large numbers. In recent years public key cryptographic systems have been improved by lengthening the factored numbers used in the formula. That, in principle, would require vastly more computing resources to break into the system. Quantum cryptography relies instead on encoding the key in a stream of quantum information -- photons that are specially polarized. If a third party eavesdrops on the communication, the fact will be immediately obvious to the parties of the secret communication. ''One of the attractive things about quantum cryptography is that security comes in the form of the laws of nature,'' said Andrew J. Shields, one of the authors and the assistant managing director for Toshiba Research Europe. ''It should, in principle, be secure forever.'' Encryption systems that are now commercially available are used to secured the wires over which digital information is transferred, but they are costly and function only over limited distances. Allowing multiple users to share a network connection while using a quantum encryption system could significantly lower costs, Dr. Shields said. He acknowledged that a quantum encryption system solved only a portion of the problem. ''To be honest, quantum cryptography allows us only to know if someone is tapping the fiber,'' he said. ''There are other areas of concern.'' But the eavesdropping that the system is designed to detect has been well documented. For example, in 2006 an AT&T technician came forward to report that the National Security Agency had established such a system to monitor communications traffic flowing through an AT&T network switching facility in San Francisco. Had a quantum cryptography system been in place, Dr. Shields said, the N.S.A. presence would have been detected. Dr. Shields said that he could not speak publicly about whether Toshiba would try to commercialize the research work of his group. The group, he said, now plans to extend the range of the system further and use it in a live computer network. "
Firm Accused In Laundering Of $6 Billion,"The operators of a global currency exchange ran a $6 billion money-laundering operation online, a central hub for criminals trafficking in everything from stolen identities to child pornography, federal prosecutors in New York said on Tuesday. The currency exchange, Liberty Reserve, operated beyond the traditional confines of United States and international banking regulations in what prosecutors called a shadowy netherworld of cyberfinance. It traded in virtual currency and provided the kind of anonymous and easily accessible banking infrastructure increasingly sought by criminal networks, law enforcement officials said. The charges announced at a news conference by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, and other law enforcement officials, mark what officials said was believed to be the largest online money-laundering case in history. Over seven years, Liberty Reserve was responsible for laundering billions of dollars, conducting 55 million transactions that involved millions of customers around the world, including about 200,000 in the United States, according to prosecutors. Richard Weber, who heads the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigation division in Washington, said at the news conference that the case heralds the arrival of ''the cyber age of money laundering,'' in which criminals ''are gravitating toward digital currency alternatives as a means to move, conceal and enjoy their ill-gotten gains.''  ''If Al Capone were alive today, this is how he would be hiding his money,'' Mr. Weber said. ''Our efforts today shatter the belief among high-tech money launderers that what happens in cyberspace stays in cyberspace.'' Just as PayPal revolutionized how people shop online, making it possible to buy a microwave oven or concert tickets with the click of a button, Liberty Reserve sought to create a similarly convenient way for criminals to make financial transactions, law enforcement officials said. The charges detailed a complicated system designed to allow people to move sums large and small around the world with virtual anonymity, according to an indictment, which was unsealed in federal court in Manhattan. ''As alleged, the only liberty that Liberty Reserve gave many of its users was the freedom to commit crimes -- the coin of its realm was anonymity, and it became a popular hub for fraudsters, hackers and traffickers,'' Mr. Bharara said at the news conference, where officials from the Justice and Treasury Departments, as well as the Secret Service and Homeland Security Investigations, also spoke. ''The global enforcement action we announce today is an important step toward reining in the 'Wild West' of illicit Internet banking. As crime goes increasingly global, the long arm of the law has to get even longer, and in this case, it encircled the earth.'' Liberty Reserve surfaced as a preferred vehicle to transfer money between parties in a number of recent high-profile cybercrimes, including the indictment of eight New Yorkers accused of helping to loot $45 million from bank machines in 27 countries, officials said. Liberty Reserve was incorporated in Costa Rica in 2006 by Arthur Budovsky, who renounced his United States citizenship in 2011, and was arrested in Spain on Friday. He was among seven people charged in the case; five of them were under arrest, while two remained at large in Costa Rica. All were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The money laundering count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and the other two charges carry a maximum of 5 years each. In addition to the criminal charges, five domain names were seized, including the one used by Liberty Reserve. Officials also seized or restricted the activity of 45 bank accounts. The closing of Liberty Reserve last week seemed to have an immediate chilling effect on its customers, who were suddenly unable to access their funds and who posted anxious comments in underground forums, according to law enforcement officials. Mr. Bharara said the exchange's clientele was largely made up of criminals, but he invited any legitimate users to contact his office to get their money back. The charges outlined how the money transfer system operated, offering a glimpse into the murky world of online financial transactions where money bounces between accounts from Cyprus to New York in the blink of an eye. To transfer money using Liberty Reserve, a user needed only to provide a name, address and date of birth. But users were not required to validate their identity. ''Accounts could therefore be opened easily using fictitious or anonymous identities,'' the indictment states. Prosecutors cited ''blatantly criminal monikers'' used by Liberty Reserve clients, like ''Russia Hackers.'' Essentially, all a customer needed to open an account was an e-mail address. One undercover agent was able to register accounts under names like ''Joe Bogus'' and describe the purpose of the account as ''for cocaine'' without being questioned, officials said. That no-questions-asked verification system made Liberty Reserve the premier bank for cybercriminals, prosecutors said. The case is significant, prosecutors said, because it attacks the financial infrastructure used by many cybercriminals in much the same way that drug-money-laundering prosecutions unravel the financial underpinnings of the narcotics trade. Dismantling the Liberty Reserve operation was ''critical because transnational criminal organizations can succeed only so long as they can funnel their illicit proceeds freely and without detection,'' said James T. Hayes Jr., the special-agent-in-charge for Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations. While Liberty Reserve was incorporated outside the United States, federal officials used a provision in the Patriot Act to target the organization and other financial institutions with whom they conducted business. It was the first time the provision had been used to prosecute a virtual currency provider, officials said. Liberty Reserve did not take or make cash payments directly and instead used ''third-party 'exchangers,' '' according to the indictment. These exchangers would take and make payments, and then credit or debit the Liberty Reserve account, allowing Liberty Reserve to avoid collecting any banking information on its clients and not leave a ''centralized financial paper trail,'' the indictment said. The exchangers, the indictment said, ''tended to be unlicensed money-transmitting businesses without significant government oversight or regulation, concentrated in Malaysia, Russia, Nigeria and Vietnam.'' The people who accepted Liberty Reserve's currency were ''overwhelmingly criminal in nature,'' according to the indictment. ''They included, for example: traffickers of stolen credit card data and personal identity information; peddlers of various types of online Ponzi and get-rich-quick schemes; computer hackers for hire; unregulated gambling enterprises; and underground drug-dealing Web sites,'' according to the indictment. Despite the case against Liberty Reserve, security experts said, there were plenty of online payment systems that allow users to move money without verifying their identities. ''Organized crime and terrorist groups are now financing their operations through these anonymous payment systems,'' said Tom Kellermann, a vice president at Trend Micro, a security firm. ''The financial sector no longer has a monopoly on moving capital around the world.'' "
N.S.A. Able To Foil Basic Safeguards Of Privacy On Web,"The National Security Agency is winning its long-running secret war on encryption, using supercomputers, technical trickery, court orders and behind-the-scenes persuasion to undermine the major tools protecting the privacy of everyday communications in the Internet age, according to newly disclosed documents. The agency has circumvented or cracked much of the encryption, or digital scrambling, that guards global commerce and banking systems, protects sensitive data like trade secrets and medical records, and automatically secures the e-mails, Web searches, Internet chats and phone calls of Americans and others around the world, the documents show. Many users assume -- or have been assured by Internet companies -- that their data is safe from prying eyes, including those of the government, and the N.S.A. wants to keep it that way. The agency treats its recent successes in deciphering protected information as among its most closely guarded secrets, restricted to those cleared for a highly classified program code-named Bullrun, according to the documents, provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor.  Beginning in 2000, as encryption tools were gradually blanketing the Web, the N.S.A. invested billions of dollars in a clandestine campaign to preserve its ability to eavesdrop. Having lost a public battle in the 1990s to insert its own ''back door'' in all encryption, it set out to accomplish the same goal by stealth. The agency, according to the documents and interviews with industry officials, deployed custom-built, superfast computers to break codes, and began collaborating with technology companies in the United States and abroad to build entry points into their products. The documents do not identify which companies have participated. The N.S.A. hacked into target computers to snare messages before they were encrypted. In some cases, companies say they were coerced by the government into handing over their master encryption keys or building in a back door. And the agency used its influence as the world's most experienced code maker to covertly introduce weaknesses into the encryption standards followed by hardware and software developers around the world. ''For the past decade, N.S.A. has led an aggressive, multipronged effort to break widely used Internet encryption technologies,'' said a 2010 memo describing a briefing about N.S.A. accomplishments for employees of its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ. ''Cryptanalytic capabilities are now coming online. Vast amounts of encrypted Internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable.'' When the British analysts, who often work side by side with N.S.A. officers, were first told about the program, another memo said, ''those not already briefed were gobsmacked!'' An intelligence budget document makes clear that the effort is still going strong. ''We are investing in groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities to defeat adversarial cryptography and exploit Internet traffic,'' the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., wrote in his budget request for the current year. In recent months, the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden have described the N.S.A.'s reach in scooping up vast amounts of communications around the world. The encryption documents now show, in striking detail, how the agency works to ensure that it is actually able to read the information it collects. The agency's success in defeating many of the privacy protections offered by encryption does not change the rules that prohibit the deliberate targeting of Americans' e-mails or phone calls without a warrant. But it shows that the agency, which was sharply rebuked by a federal judge in 2011 for violating the rules and misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, cannot necessarily be restrained by privacy technology. N.S.A. rules permit the agency to store any encrypted communication, domestic or foreign, for as long as the agency is trying to decrypt it or analyze its technical features. The N.S.A., which has specialized in code-breaking since its creation in 1952, sees that task as essential to its mission. If it cannot decipher the messages of terrorists, foreign spies and other adversaries, the United States will be at serious risk, agency officials say. Just in recent weeks, the Obama administration has called on the intelligence agencies for details of communications by leaders of Al Qaeda about a terrorist plot and of Syrian officials' messages about the chemical weapons attack outside Damascus. If such communications can be hidden by unbreakable encryption, N.S.A. officials say, the agency cannot do its work. But some experts say the N.S.A.'s campaign to bypass and weaken communications security may have serious unintended consequences. They say the agency is working at cross-purposes with its other major mission, apart from eavesdropping: ensuring the security of American communications. Some of the agency's most intensive efforts have focused on the encryption in universal use in the United States, including Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL; virtual private networks, or VPNs; and the protection used on fourth-generation, or 4G, smartphones. Many Americans, often without realizing it, rely on such protection every time they send an e-mail, buy something online, consult with colleagues via their company's computer network, or use a phone or a tablet on a 4G network. For at least three years, one document says, GCHQ, almost certainly in collaboration with the N.S.A., has been looking for ways into protected traffic of popular Internet companies: Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Microsoft's Hotmail. By 2012, GCHQ had developed ''new access opportunities'' into Google's systems, according to the document. (Google denied giving any government access and said it had no evidence its systems had been breached). ''The risk is that when you build a back door into systems, you're not the only one to exploit it,'' said Matthew D. Green, a cryptography researcher at Johns Hopkins University. ''Those back doors could work against U.S. communications, too.'' Paul Kocher, a leading cryptographer who helped design the SSL protocol, recalled how the N.S.A. lost the heated national debate in the 1990s about inserting into all encryption a government back door called the Clipper Chip. ''And they went and did it anyway, without telling anyone,'' Mr. Kocher said. He said he understood the agency's mission but was concerned about the danger of allowing it unbridled access to private information. ''The intelligence community has worried about 'going dark' forever, but today they are conducting instant, total invasion of privacy with limited effort,'' he said. ''This is the golden age of spying.'' A Vital Capability The documents are among more than 50,000 shared by The Guardian with The New York Times and ProPublica, the nonprofit news organization. They focus on GCHQ but include thousands from or about the N.S.A. Intelligence officials asked The Times and ProPublica not to publish this article, saying it might prompt foreign targets to switch to new forms of encryption or communications that would be harder to collect or read. The news organizations removed some specific facts but decided to publish the article because of the value of a public debate about government actions that weaken the most powerful privacy tools. The files show that the agency is still stymied by some encryption, as Mr. Snowden suggested in a question-and-answer session on The Guardian's Web site in June. ''Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on,'' he said, though cautioning that the N.S.A. often bypasses the encryption altogether by targeting the computers at one end or the other and grabbing text before it is encrypted or after it is decrypted. The documents make clear that the N.S.A. considers its ability to decrypt information a vital capability, one in which it competes with China, Russia and other intelligence powers. ''In the future, superpowers will be made or broken based on the strength of their cryptanalytic programs,'' a 2007 document said. ''It is the price of admission for the U.S. to maintain unrestricted access to and use of cyberspace.'' The full extent of the N.S.A.'s decoding capabilities is known only to a limited group of top analysts from the so-called Five Eyes: the N.S.A. and its counterparts in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Only they are cleared for the Bullrun program, the successor to one called Manassas -- both names of an American Civil War battle. A parallel GCHQ counterencryption program is called Edgehill, named for the first battle of the English Civil War of the 17th century. Unlike some classified information that can be parceled out on a strict ''need to know'' basis, one document makes clear that with Bullrun, ''there will be NO 'need to know.' '' Only a small cadre of trusted contractors were allowed to join Bullrun. It does not appear that Mr. Snowden was among them, but he nonetheless managed to obtain dozens of classified documents referring to the program's capabilities, methods and sources. Ties to Internet Companies When the N.S.A. was founded, encryption was an obscure technology used mainly by diplomats and military officers. Over the last 20 years, it has become ubiquitous. Even novices can tell that their exchanges are being automatically encrypted when a tiny padlock appears next to a Web address. Because strong encryption can be so effective, classified N.S.A. documents make clear, the agency's success depends on working with Internet companies -- by getting their voluntary collaboration, forcing their cooperation with court orders or surreptitiously stealing their encryption keys or altering their software or hardware. According to an intelligence budget document leaked by Mr. Snowden, the N.S.A. spends more than $250 million a year on its Sigint Enabling Project, which ''actively engages the U.S. and foreign IT industries to covertly influence and/or overtly leverage their commercial products' designs'' to make them ''exploitable.'' Sigint is the acronym for signals intelligence, the technical term for electronic eavesdropping. By this year, the Sigint Enabling Project had found ways inside some of the encryption chips that scramble information for businesses and governments, either by working with chipmakers to insert back doors or by exploiting security flaws, according to the documents. The agency also expected to gain full unencrypted access to an unnamed major Internet phone call and text service; to a Middle Eastern Internet service; and to the communications of three foreign governments. In one case, after the government learned that a foreign intelligence target had ordered new computer hardware, the American manufacturer agreed to insert a back door into the product before it was shipped, someone familiar with the request told The Times. The 2013 N.S.A. budget request highlights ''partnerships with major telecommunications carriers to shape the global network to benefit other collection accesses'' -- that is, to allow more eavesdropping. At Microsoft, as The Guardian has reported, the N.S.A. worked with company officials to get pre-encryption access to Microsoft's most popular services, including Outlook e-mail, Skype Internet phone calls and chats, and SkyDrive, the company's cloud storage service. Microsoft asserted that it had merely complied with ''lawful demands'' of the government, and in some cases, the collaboration was clearly coerced. Some companies have been asked to hand the government the encryption keys to all customer communications, according to people familiar with the government's requests. N.S.A. documents show that the agency maintains an internal database of encryption keys for specific commercial products, called a Key Provisioning Service, which can automatically decode many messages. If the necessary key is not in the collection, a request goes to the separate Key Recovery Service, which tries to obtain it. How keys are acquired is shrouded in secrecy, but independent cryptographers say many are probably collected by hacking into companies' computer servers, where they are stored. To keep such methods secret, the N.S.A. shares decrypted messages with other agencies only if the keys could have been acquired through legal means. ''Approval to release to non-Sigint agencies,'' a GCHQ document says, ''will depend on there being a proven non-Sigint method of acquiring keys.'' Simultaneously, the N.S.A. has been deliberately weakening the international encryption standards adopted by developers. One goal in the agency's 2013 budget request was to ''influence policies, standards and specifications for commercial public key technologies,'' the most common encryption method. Cryptographers have long suspected that the agency planted vulnerabilities in a standard adopted in 2006 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and later by the International Organization for Standardization, which has 163 countries as members. Classified N.S.A. memos appear to confirm that the fatal weakness, discovered by two Microsoft cryptographers in 2007, was engineered by the agency. The N.S.A. wrote the standard and aggressively pushed it on the international group, privately calling the effort ''a challenge in finesse.'' ''Eventually, N.S.A. became the sole editor,'' the memo says. Even agency programs ostensibly intended to guard American communications are sometimes used to weaken protections. The N.S.A.'s Commercial Solutions Center, for instance, invites the makers of encryption technologies to present their products to the agency with the goal of improving American cybersecurity. But a top-secret N.S.A. document suggests that the agency's hacking division uses that same program to develop and ''leverage sensitive, cooperative relationships with specific industry partners'' to insert vulnerabilities into Internet security products. By introducing such back doors, the N.S.A. has surreptitiously accomplished what it had failed to do in the open. Two decades ago, officials grew concerned about the spread of strong encryption software like Pretty Good Privacy, designed by a programmer named Phil Zimmermann. The Clinton administration fought back by proposing the Clipper Chip, which would have effectively neutered digital encryption by ensuring that the N.S.A. always had the key. That proposal met a backlash from an unlikely coalition that included political opposites like Senator John Ashcroft, the Missouri Republican, and Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, as well as the televangelist Pat Robertson, Silicon Valley executives and the American Civil Liberties Union. All argued that the Clipper would kill not only the Fourth Amendment, but also America's global technology edge. By 1996, the White House backed down. But soon the N.S.A. began trying to anticipate and thwart encryption tools before they became mainstream. Each novel encryption effort generated anxiety. When Mr. Zimmermann introduced the Zfone, an encrypted phone technology, N.S.A. analysts circulated the announcement in an e-mail titled ''This can't be good.'' But by 2006, an N.S.A. document notes, the agency had broken into communications for three foreign airlines, one travel reservation system, one foreign government's nuclear department and another's Internet service by cracking the virtual private networks that protected them. By 2010, the Edgehill program, the British counterencryption effort, was unscrambling VPN traffic for 30 targets and had set a goal of an additional 300. But the agencies' goal was to move away from decrypting targets' tools one by one and instead decode, in real time, all of the information flying over the world's fiber optic cables and through its Internet hubs, only afterward searching the decrypted material for valuable intelligence. A 2010 document calls for ''a new approach for opportunistic decryption, rather than targeted.'' By that year, a Bullrun briefing document claims that the agency had developed ''groundbreaking capabilities'' against encrypted Web chats and phone calls. Its successes against Secure Sockets Layer and virtual private networks were gaining momentum. But the agency was concerned that it could lose the advantage it had worked so long to gain, if the mere ''fact of'' decryption became widely known. ''These capabilities are among the Sigint community's most fragile, and the inadvertent disclosure of the simple 'fact of' could alert the adversary and result in immediate loss of the capability,'' a GCHQ document warned. Since Mr. Snowden's disclosures ignited criticism of overreach and privacy infringements by the N.S.A., American technology companies have faced scrutiny from customers and the public over what some see as too cozy a relationship with the government. In response, some companies have begun to push back against what they describe as government bullying. Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook have pressed for permission to reveal more about the government's requests for cooperation. One e-mail encryption company, Lavabit, closed rather than comply with the agency's demands for customer information; another, Silent Circle, ended its e-mail service rather than face such demands. In effect, facing the N.S.A.'s relentless advance, the companies surrendered. Ladar Levison, the founder of Lavabit, wrote a public letter to his disappointed customers, offering an ominous warning. ''Without Congressional action or a strong judicial precedent,'' he wrote, ''I would strongly recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States.'' "
Microsoft's General Counsel: N.S.A. Hacks Were An 'Earthquake' For Tech,"Microsoft is the latest company to try to protect its data from its own government. An article on Thursday indicates that Microsoft is in the process of expanding and strengthening the encryption for popular services including the email service Outlook.com, Office 365 apps, the Azure cloud-computing service and Skydrive online storage. It is also adding an encryption technology, called Perfect Forward Secrecy, that thwarts eavesdropping. The company is also scrambling the links between its data centers in an effort to assure users and foreign governments that their data is not free for the National Security Agency's taking.   The company says encryption and Perfect Forward Secrecy will become the default setting for users by the end of 2014. The announcement follows similar efforts by Google, Twitter, Mozilla, Facebook and Yahoo. But Microsoft said it will also go several steps further, by making a contractual promise to business and government customers that it will alert them if it receives legal orders related to their data - and fight every gag order in court. Microsoft will also open up so-called transparency centers, where governments can inspect its products code for back doors.  Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said the company had long considered such efforts, but was jolted to action after recent reportsthat the N.S.A. may be gaining access to companies' data without their knowledge. ""The idea that the government may be hacking into corporate data centers was a bit like an earthquake, sending shock waves across the tech sector,"" Mr. Smith said in an interview. ""We concluded that we better assume that there might be such an attempt at Microsoft, or has already been."" The end goal, Mr. Smith said, is to force would-be snoops to go to court - not hack into its data centers - for customers' data. ""We all want to live in a world that is safe and secure, but we also want to live in a country that is governed by the Constitution."" And therein lies the rub. Microsoft's efforts - and for that matter Google's, Twitter's, Mozilla's, Facebook's and Yahoo's - still do not prevent the government from gaining access to their data through a court order. And some security experts point out that even if companies like Microsoft allow outsiders to inspect their code, that only eliminates one mode of attack; snoops could still find holes in other parts of the system. To make governments' jobs more difficult, executives at Lavabit and Silent Circle, two secure message providers, have been lobbying major Internet companies to adopt a new Dark Mail e-mail protocol that would encrypt user data and metadata in such a way that it would leave the keys with the user, not the provider. Dark Mail would thereby force governments, or hackers, to go straight to the user to unscramble their data. But Mike Janke, a co-founder at Silent Circle, said he was skeptical they would adopt the protocol because companies rely on access to user data to serve up targeted ads. ""The real friction point is that Yahoo, Google and Microsoft make money mining off free email,"" Mr. Janke said in an interview. ""They say they're concerned about user privacy. Now we'll see if they really care.""    "
Researchers Work to Add More Anonymity to Bitcoin,"In my column this week, Disruptions: A Digital Underworld Cloaked in Anonymity, I noted that the Deep Web, or Dark Internet, had mushroomed in recent years because of a growing belief that it was possible to remain anonymous online.  Want some crack cocaine or a semi-automatic gun? No problem, you can get them on the Internet. All you need is Tor, an anonymous Web browser, to do your shopping, and some bitcoins, a private cybercurrency, to pay for your merchandise. Then off you go to a long list of sites that sell these illegal goods - including Silk Road, Black Market Reloaded or Sheep Marketplace. But are people buying and selling wares online really anonymous? Researchers I spoke with for my column said in some instances that was true. But like most online transactions, people might be leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that could eventually point  to their real identity. While the bitcoin network is a decentralized mechanism for creating and transferring electronic cash around the Web, it also stores those transactions in a public ledger, which is called the ""blockchain"" that keeps track of every payment history. While it's not as easy as trackng credit card transactions in real life, some researchers believe that the information tied to a bitcoin can be traced, specifically by tracking the string of numbers and letters that make up a single bitcoin and then looking at its purchase history. Matthew D. Green, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, said he had been working with a team of researchers to come up with a solution to this problem. The team has been developing a new system, called ""Zerocoin,"" which is a proposed extension for bitcoins that would be able to provide complete anonymity for this currency. ""We start with a bitcoin and then append a bunch of extensions on top of it - like additional random numbers - and then we swap bitcoins out with a Zerocoin,"" Mr. Green said in an interview. ""By doing this, we can completely anonymize the currency."" Mr. Green said he was not working on this project to help people procure drugs and guns online, but rather because he believed in the promise of letting people communicate and perform transactions in an anonymous and completely democratic way - much like using cash. Other researchers I spoke with noted that this is the same reason the anonymous Web browser Tor, short for The Onion Router, exists. While Tor is used by people who buy drugs online, the software, which was originally developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, is intended to protect online government communications and allow people  living in countries with repressive governments to communicate safely.

"Fraud in Bitcoin, Unchecked","IN BITCOIN, FRAUD IS QUICKER THAN THE LAW  |  Pump-and-dump schemes are shut down in the financial markets all the time. But such frauds involving digital money like Bitcoin have gone unchecked, Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. Government authorities do not agree on which laws apply to Bitcoin, the popular virtual currency - or even on what Bitcoin is. One recent scam began with a call on Twitter: ""For insane profits come and join the pump."" The person behind it, a trader known on Twitter as Fontas, told Mr. Popper in a secure Internet chat that he operated with little fear of a crackdown. ""For now, the lack of regulations allows everything to happen,"" Fontas said in the chat, where he verified his control of the Twitter account but did not give his identity. He added that the world of Bitcoin would benefit when someone steps in to police it, and would stop his schemes when they do. Mr. Popper writes: ""Chinese authorities drew attention to the issue on Thursday when they announced that they were barring Chinese banks from making Bitcoin transactions. The same day, the Bank of France issued its own warning about the potential risks. The news sent the price of Bitcoin tumbling, but it quickly bounced back to near its all-time high of around $1,200.  ""Bitcoins are little more than computer code - created according to a set algorithm and traded between online wallets using virtual keys. Some people insist that virtual currencies could become a revolutionary new form of payment in the real world. Bank of America became the first major Wall Street bank to release research about Bitcoin on Thursday, noting that it could become 'a major player in both e-commerce and money transfer.'"" SEARS TO SPIN OFF LANDS' END  |  Sears Holdings, the struggling retailer run by the hedge fund manager Edward S. Lampert, said on Friday that it had filed to spin off its Lands' End business by distributing shares to investors. The company said it expected the spinoff to be tax free for shareholders in the United States, except for any cash received in lieu of fractional shares. The move is subject to approval by the board.  LIVELY DEBATE ON PROXY ADVISORY FIRMS  |  Corporate shareholders voting on a merger or the election of directors often take advice from so-called proxy advisory firms, independent groups that analyze such issues. But companies and regulators are growing uncomfortable with the amount of influence these advisory firms wield, DealBook's David Gelles reports. These critics say that the two main firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, are understaffed and often uninformed, and that the firms, which also offer consulting services, are riddled with conflicts of interest. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday hosted a round-table discussion that examined the influence of proxy advisers. While it has not proposed any rules, the agency is considering if any regulation is needed. The S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary Jo White, said that as the influence of proxy advisers had grown, so had questions about the fairness of their recommendations and decision making. ""I am particularly interested in the discussion of conflicts of interest that may or may not arise in connection with the participation of proxy advisers in our system - what they are and views on how they should be addressed,"" Ms. White said. TWITTER ADDS FIRST FEMALE BOARD MEMBER  |  Twitter, which came under fire in the run-up to its I.P.O. for the absence of any women on its board of directors, said on Thursday that it had added the former publishing executive Marjorie M. Scardino to its board. The addition of Ms. Scardino, the first woman to serve as a director at the company, expands Twitter's board to eight members from seven. Ms. Scardino, 66, is the former chief executive officer of Pearson, the London-based education and media conglomerate. She has also served on Nokia's board. Vindu Goel writes on the Bits blog: ""Ms. Scardino's background should certainly help Twitter with its global expansion plans and its efforts to encourage use of the service by the media, including news organizations around the world. Before running Pearson, she ran its Economist Group, which is well known for its deeply reported country and industry profiles. And as the leader of one of the world's largest publishing companies, she certainly got to know some of the biggest advertisers on the planet.""

Spies Infiltrate a Fantasy Realm of Online Games,"Not limiting their activities to the earthly realm, American and British spies have infiltrated the fantasy worlds of World of Warcraft and Second Life, conducting surveillance and scooping up data in the online games played by millions of people across the globe, according to newly disclosed classified documents. Fearing that terrorist or criminal networks could use the games to communicate secretly, move money or plot attacks, the documents show, intelligence operatives have entered terrain populated by digital avatars that include elves, gnomes and supermodels. The spies have created make-believe characters to snoop and to try to recruit informers, while also collecting data and contents of communications between players, according to the documents, disclosed by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. Because militants often rely on features common to video games -- fake identities, voice and text chats, a way to conduct financial transactions -- American and British intelligence agencies worried that they might be operating there, according to the papers. Online games might seem innocuous, a top-secret 2008 N.S.A. document warned, but they had the potential to be a ''target-rich communication network'' allowing intelligence suspects ''a way to hide in plain sight.'' Virtual games ''are an opportunity!'' another 2008 N.S.A. document declared.  But for all their enthusiasm -- so many C.I.A., F.B.I. and Pentagon spies were hunting around in Second Life, the document noted, that a ''deconfliction'' group was needed to avoid collisions -- the intelligence agencies may have inflated the threat. The documents, obtained by The Guardian and shared with The New York Times and ProPublica, do not cite any counterterrorism successes from the effort. Former American intelligence officials, current and former gaming company employees and outside experts said in interviews that they knew of little evidence that terrorist groups viewed the games as havens to communicate and plot operations. Games ''are built and operated by companies looking to make money, so the players' identity and activity is tracked,'' said Peter W. Singer of the Brookings Institution, an author of ''Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know.'' ''For terror groups looking to keep their communications secret, there are far more effective and easier ways to do so than putting on a troll avatar.'' The surveillance, which also included Microsoft's Xbox Live, could raise privacy concerns. It is not clear exactly how the agencies got access to gamers' data or communications, how many players may have been monitored or whether Americans' communications or activities were captured. One American company, the maker of World of Warcraft, said that neither the N.S.A. nor its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters, had gotten permission to gather intelligence in its game. Many players are Americans, who can be targeted for surveillance only with approval from the nation's secret intelligence court. The spy agencies, though, face far fewer restrictions on collecting certain data or communications overseas. ""We are unaware of any surveillance taking place,"" said a spokesman for Blizzard Entertainment, based in Irvine, Calif., which makes World of Warcraft. ""If it was, it would have been done without our knowledge or permission."" A spokeswoman for Microsoft declined to comment. Philip Rosedale, the founder of Second Life and a former chief executive officer of Linden Lab, the game's maker, declined to comment on the spying revelations. Current Linden executives did not respond to requests for comment. A Government Communications Headquarters spokesman would neither confirm nor deny any involvement by that agency in gaming surveillance, but said that its work is conducted under ''a strict legal and policy framework'' with rigorous oversight. An N.S.A. spokeswoman declined to comment. Intelligence and law enforcement officials became interested in games after some became enormously popular, drawing tens of millions of people worldwide, from preteens to retirees. The games rely on lifelike graphics, virtual currencies and the ability to speak to other players in real time. Some gamers merge the virtual and real worlds by spending long hours playing and making close online friends. In World of Warcraft, players share the same fantasy universe -- walking around and killing computer-controlled monsters or the avatars of other players, including elves, animals or creatures known as orcs. In Second Life, players create customized human avatars that can resemble themselves or take on other personas -- supermodels and bodybuilders are popular -- who can socialize, buy and sell virtual goods, and go places like beaches, cities, art galleries and strip clubs. In Microsoft's Xbox Live service, subscribers connect online in games that can involve activities like playing soccer or shooting at each other in space. According to American officials and the documents, spy agencies grew worried that terrorist groups might take to the virtual worlds to establish safe communications channels. In 2007, as the N.S.A. and other intelligence agencies were beginning to explore virtual games, N.S.A. officials met with the chief technology officer for the manufacturer of Second Life, the San Francisco-based Linden Lab. The executive, Cory Ondrejka, was a former Navy officer who had worked at the N.S.A. with a top-secret security clearance. He visited the agency's headquarters at Fort Meade, Md., in May 2007 to speak to staff members over a brown bag lunch, according to an internal agency announcement. ''Second Life has proven that virtual worlds of social networking are a reality: come hear Cory tell you why!'' said the announcement. It added that virtual worlds gave the government the opportunity ''to understand the motivation, context and consequent behaviors of non-Americans through observation, without leaving U.S. soil.'' Mr. Ondrejka, now the director of mobile engineering at Facebook, said through a representative that the N.S.A. presentation was similar to others he gave in that period, and declined to comment further. Even with spies already monitoring games, the N.S.A. thought it needed to step up the effort. ''The Sigint Enterprise needs to begin taking action now to plan for collection, processing, presentation and analysis of these communications,'' said one April 2008 N.S.A. document, referring to ''signals intelligence.'' The document added, ''With a few exceptions, N.S.A. can't even recognize the traffic,'' meaning that the agency could not distinguish gaming data from other Internet traffic. By the end of 2008, according to one document, the British spy agency, known as GCHQ, had set up its ''first operational deployment into Second Life'' and had helped the police in London in cracking down on a crime ring that had moved into virtual worlds to sell stolen credit card information. The British spies running the effort, which was code-named Operation Galician, were aided by an informer using a digital avatar ''who helpfully volunteered information on the target group's latest activities.'' Though the games might appear to be unregulated digital bazaars, the companies running them reserve the right to police the communications of players and store the chat dialogues in servers that can be searched later. The transactions conducted with the virtual money common in the games, used in World of Warcraft to buy weapons and potions to slay monsters, are also monitored by the companies to prevent illicit financial dealings. In the 2008 N.S.A. document, titled ''Exploiting Terrorist Use of Games & Virtual Environments,'' the agency said that ''terrorist target selectors'' -- which could be a computer's Internet Protocol address or an email account -- ''have been found associated with Xbox Live, Second Life, World of Warcraft'' and other games. But that document does not present evidence that terrorists were participating in the games. Still, the intelligence agencies found other benefits in infiltrating these online worlds. According to the minutes of a January 2009 meeting, GCHQ's ''network gaming exploitation team'' had identified engineers, embassy drivers, scientists and other foreign intelligence operatives to be World of Warcraft players -- potential targets for recruitment as agents. At Menwith Hill, a Royal Air Force base in the Yorkshire countryside that the N.S.A. has long used as an outpost to intercept global communications, American and British intelligence operatives started an effort in 2008 to begin collecting data from World of Warcraft. One N.S.A. document said that the World of Warcraft monitoring ''continues to uncover potential Sigint value by identifying accounts, characters and guilds related to Islamic extremist groups, nuclear proliferation and arms dealing.'' In other words, targets of interest appeared to be playing the fantasy game, though the document does not indicate that they were doing so for any nefarious purposes. A British document from later that year said that GCHQ had ''successfully been able to get the discussions between different game players on Xbox Live.'' By 2009, the collection was extensive. One document says that while GCHQ was testing its ability to spy on Second Life in real time, British intelligence officers vacuumed up three days' worth of Second Life chat, instant message and financial transaction data, totaling 176,677 lines of data, which included the content of the communications. For their part, players have openly wondered whether the N.S.A. might be watching them. In one World of Warcraft discussion thread, begun just days after the first Snowden revelations appeared in the news media in June, a human death knight with the user name ''Crrassus'' asked whether the N.S.A. might be reading game chat logs. ''If they ever read these forums,'' wrote a goblin priest with the user name ''Diaya,'' ''they would realize they were wasting'' their time. Even before the American government began spying in virtual worlds, the Pentagon had identified the potential intelligence value of video games. The Pentagon's Special Operations Command in 2006 and 2007 worked with several foreign companies -- including an obscure digital media business based in Prague -- to build games that could be downloaded to mobile phones, according to people involved in the effort. They said the games, which were not identified as creations of the Pentagon, were then used as vehicles for intelligence agencies to collect information about the users. Eager to cash in on the government's growing interest in virtual worlds, several large private contractors have spent years pitching their services to American intelligence agencies. In one 66-page document from 2007, part of the cache released by Mr. Snowden, the contracting giant SAIC promoted its ability to support ''intelligence collection in the game space,'' and warned that online games could be used by militant groups to recruit followers and could provide ''terrorist organizations with a powerful platform to reach core target audiences.'' It is unclear whether SAIC received a contract based on this proposal, but one former SAIC employee said that the company at one point had a lucrative contract with the C.I.A. for work that included monitoring the Internet for militant activity. An SAIC spokeswoman declined to comment. In spring 2009, academics and defense contractors gathered at the Marriott at Washington Dulles International Airport to present proposals for a government study about how players' behavior in a game like World of Warcraft might be linked to their real-world identities. ''We were told it was highly likely that persons of interest were using virtual spaces to communicate or coordinate,'' said Dmitri Williams, a professor at the University of Southern California who received grant money as part of the program. After the conference, both SAIC and Lockheed Martin won contracts worth several million dollars, administered by an office within the intelligence community that finances research projects. It is not clear how useful such research might be. A group at the Palo Alto Research Center, for example, produced a government-funded study of World of Warcraft that found ''younger players and male players preferring competitive, hack-and-slash activities, and older and female players preferring noncombat activities,'' such as exploring the virtual world. A group from the nonprofit SRI International, meanwhile, found that players under age 18 often used all capital letters both in chat messages and in their avatar names. Those involved in the project were told little by their government patrons. According to Nick Yee, a Palo Alto researcher who worked on the effort, ''We were specifically asked not to speculate on the government's motivations and goals.'' "
South Korea Blames North for June Cyberattacks,"SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea blamed North Korea on Tuesday for a wave of cyberattacks that paralyzed 69 Web sites last month, including those belonging to the presidential office and local media companies.  The South Korean Science Ministry said it reached its conclusion after analyzing the damaged servers and personal computers, malicious codes, Internet Protocol addresses and other data used in the attacks, which took place on June 25, the 63rd anniversary of the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean War. A government panel of investigators also found similarities between the codes and other hacking methods used in the June disruptions and the cyberattacks that shut down tens of thousands of computers at South Korean broadcasters and banks in March. The South had earlier blamed the North for the March attacks. In the June attacks, people who said they were part of a global network of hackers called Anonymous claimed responsibility on Twitter. On Tuesday, the South Korean ministry said the North probably used the claims to create confusion about the source of the attacks. On June 25, major Web sites in North Korea were also shut down in what South Korean media called cyberattacks. The rival Korean governments have accused each other of hacking attacks in recent years, although they officially deny their own involvement. The hacking attacks in June were the latest in a series of ''cyberterrorism'' cases that South Korea has cited as evidence that the North was running an army of Internet warriors to disrupt the South, one of the world's most wired countries. South Korean officials have said that countering with their own hacking operations would have only limited effect on the North, since most of its society and government has been kept from Internet access. ''These were meticulously planned attacks that had been prepared at least for several months to find the weak spots of their targets,'' said Park Jae-moon, a senior ministry official, during a media briefing. He said the hackers operated through file-sharing Web sites in South Korea. Investigators said that a lot of personal data was lost from the stricken Web sites, although they managed to recover them from the damaged hard drives. Earlier this month, the cybersecurity firm McAfee Labs, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said that its analysis of the March attacks in South Korea showed that ''the incident was more than cybervandalism.'' ''The attacks on South Korean targets were actually the conclusion of a covert espionage campaign,'' it said. While reporting that the attacks were trying to steal South Korean and American military data, McAfee did not blame North Korea by name. It also added that the ''overall tactics were not that sophisticated in comparison to what we have seen before.'' "
Cyber Subterfuge,"I awoke one morning to a disturbing email from the software giant Adobe. The message warned that thieves had hacked into the company's servers, stolen the source code for some of its software products and almost three million passwords and credit card details, among which might be mine. It included a link to reset my password. But the link could have been an elaborate trap by criminals to infect my computer with malware and seize control of it. My first port of call was krebsonsecurity.com, the website of the tenacious cybercrime researcher Brian Krebs. Sure enough, he had posted details of the hack, and it was all true. I was instructed to click on that link and scrutinize my credit card bills for jewelry purchases in Djibouti or Moldova. Give credit to Adobe for 'fessing up to the hack so fast. But if a company like Adobe, whose products are a core communications medium for web users, can't keep the hackers out, who can?  The Internet has lost its innocence. Cybermalfeasance, or bad stuff happening on the web, is now so pervasive that if businesses and individuals fail to integrate security measures into their lives and operations, they are bound to regret it. And 2013 has been a momentous year for the extent and ingenuity of those launching attacks on networks around the world. Innovation continues to alter our digital environment at breathtaking speed. And like all entrepreneurs, the criminals, spies and so-called hacktivists seek to exploit the changes in the architecture of the Internetâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]and in our behaviorâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]for their own purposes. The problem is that it's not just thieves. In the past 10 years, state and nonstate actorsâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]intelligence agencies, terrorist groups and cybermilitary operatives to name but a fewâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]have become engaged in dubious practices on the Web. If we didn't appreciate that before, Edward J. Snowden's revelations about the National Security Agency have made it very plain. Those in the cybersecurity industry who are trying to protect you now face a huge problem: ascertaining exactly who the perpetrator is when an attack happens. Criminals learn from hacktivists; cyberintelligence agents pick up tips from criminals, and in the background, military strategists are testing potential enemy defenses worldwide. This means the virtual world is awash with subterfuge, malware and deception. They engage in this activity on the Surface Web, the part of the Internet that you and I can seeâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]or, more accurately, those websites which can be indexed by search engines like Google or Bing. But the hackers, cybercops and criminals also make use of the still-weirder world of the Deep Web. The Deep Web is several hundred, possibly thousands, of times larger than the Surface Web, and a small but significant percentage of it is used as a place for criminal and hacking networks to hide. Within the Deep Web, there are places where users can swap files and information that are very hard to reach if you have not been granted access. Most computer users have no idea that the Deep Web exists. The Silk Road, a website selling narcotics and extreme pornography, existed only on the Deep Web until the F.B.I. brought it down this fall and arrested one of its alleged founders, 29-year-old Ross William Ulbricht, better known in the business as ''Dread Pirate Roberts.'' To browse the ''eBay of drugs,'' as Silk Road was dubbed, the visitor would have to enter the Deep Web via the TOR network, a free system designed to prevent the monitoring of web activity and an important tool for those suffering from political persecution. The existence of complex systems of communication beyond the Surface Web makes it hard to grasp exactly what is going on in the world of cybermalfeasance. It includes three primary areas of activity: crime; commercial and political espionage; and cyberwarfare and sabotage. It's often tough for law enforcement and analysts to identify where one activity ends and the next one starts. In addition to these categories, there are two gray areas: hacktivism, notably by the group Anonymous, whose members appear to be motivated more by ideology than money, and whose zeal frequently takes them beyond the law; and intellectual copyright theft, a hugely vexing question for the creative industries, with no real solutions in sight. The most familiar crime is the so-called high-volume, low-impact phenomenon of credit and debit card fraud. Despite occasional horror stories, credit card fraud remains at a manageable level for both the industry and consumers. In 2012, fraudsters got their hands on some $11.5 billion worldwide by stealing credit card data, but this crime has been falling steadily since the second half of the last decade, as most major territories around the world have adopted the so-called chip and pin system. The exception to that trend is the United States, where credit card fraud continues to rise steadilyâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]a direct consequence of the lamentable failure of card issuers, banks and regulators to introduce chip and pin systems. U.S. cards continue to rely on magnetic strips that are easily copied, and on signatures, which are farcical as a security measure. Still, card fraud is essentially an inconvenience, not a threat. The bigger threat comes from the occasional breathtaking heist, when hackers access databases with large stores of credit cards. The Adobe hack was one such case, and actually modest by some standards. In February, for example, criminals sucked a staggering $40 million from A.T.M.'s in at least two dozen countries around the world, in just 10 hours. Using sophisticated hacking techniques, the gang broke into the database of the processing company in India and lifted the cap on hundreds of prepaid credit cards they had purchased in advance. Associates around the world then gutted A.T.M.'s of far more money than armed robbers could ever hope to get from a physical bank raid. The case also suggests how levels of cybercriminal organization are rising. The lone-wolf hackers who dominated such activity a decade or so ago are being eclipsed by more disciplined groups that identify specific targets, usually companies, for their attacks. This accounts for one of the most important recent developments in cybercrime: the emergence of a vibrant secondary market in ''Zero-Day exploits.'' Zero Days are glitches in software unnoticed by their manufactures. Hackers can use them as digital wormholes through which to crawl into a system and take control of it. Increasingly, however, it makes more sense to sell them. Zero Days fetch from $10,000 to $250,000, and the market is not defined as illegal. Buyers come from everywhereâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]governments, spy agencies, criminal gangs, cybersecurity companies and the military are all eager to purchase them. For many cybercriminals who have done their apprenticeships in credit-card fraud or hacking systems, selling Zero Days is low risk, not especially onerous and very lucrative. Negotiations take place in the nether regions of the Deep Web or offline, for security reasons. Once in possession of a Zero Day, the task of planning a targeted attack becomes much easier. And as most people in industry are now aware, the growth in criminal activity affects business worldwide. Government departments, charities and N.G.O.'s, corporations and small enterprises alike are now subject to regular targeted attacks, tailored very precisely. At first glance, the numbers are remarkable. This year, BP's chief executive, Bob Dudley, revealed that his security department registers 50,000 attacks a day. Gen. Keith Alexander, double-hatted chief of the U.S. National Security Agency and the Department of Defense's Cyber Command, testified to Congress that the Pentagon has to deal with 10 million attacks daily. Most of these are mere irritants, digital flies that can be swatted with ease. But among them are a few bugs that are able to penetrate the epidermis of a networked system and inject debilitating poison. These attacks are generally very cheap to mount, but the costs can be devastating. This year, the Syrian Electronic Army, a group of pro-Assad hackers, started to specialize in attacks with eye-popping consequences. In late April, the S.E.A. successfully hacked into The Associated Press's Twitter account and used it to post a false report that the White House had been attacked and the president wounded. In the subsequent two minutes, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost $136.5 billion in value. The index recovered immediately, but the incident reflected the disproportionate impact that a very simple intrusion can have. At the same time, some of the figures bandied about by politicians, police officials and intelligence agencies regarding the damage wrought by cybercrime have been greatly exaggerated. The cybersecurity giant McAfee announced this summer that losses in the United States to cybercrime could be up to $120 billion. Compare that to the $1 trillion worldwide figure that President Obama cited in 2009, with McAfee again as the source. By contrast, thanks to Gartner, the computer consultancy and research firm, we have a much more precise idea of how much we are spending on cybersecurity. In 2013, global spending on protection will reach $67 billion, and by the end of the decade it is predicted to exceed $100 billion. The biggest game changer this year, however, was not the costs, but the information leaked by Snowden about the extraordinary extent of the digital espionage activities of the N.S.A., notably in conjunction with its British partner, the Government Communications Headquarters, or G.C.H.Q. The moral high ground, carefully constructed by the United States on the indiscriminate hacking and spy programs run by the Chinese and the Russians, has crumbled. Snowden's countless dossiers have demonstrated beyond doubt that the United States has been engaging in precisely the type of systematic espionage that it accuses Beijing and Moscow of undertaking. Michael V. Hayden, former chief of the N.S.A. and of the C.I.A., argued rather controversially in London in late September that there was nothing illegal about the N.S.A.'s activities and that nobody in the United States was unduly concerned about the Snowden revelations. That was damage control. The United States has lost the moral high ground, and the recent disclosures of its surveillance of the phones, email and browser of the Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, not to mention the semi-state oil company, Petrobras, may well come back to haunt Washington. Each week seems to bring a new revelation from the Snowden files, one more embarrassing than the next. Particularly awkward was the news that the United States has been listening to the phone conversations of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. It is hard to assess how much of the targets' indignant reactions is genuine and how much is just strutting in front of an outraged domestic public. But there are signs that the leaks are having an impact on global telecommunications policy. Partly as a consequence of the criminal, espionage and military activity across the Internet, the issue of who controls the web has recently moved up the agenda of the International Telecommunication Union. The issue of who actually runs the basic infrastructure is being contested at the I.T.U. by a group of nations led by Russia and China, which seek to exercise ever-greater control of the web on their territory. Brazil and India are sympathetic to attempts to wrest greater control from the United States in particular, and the Snowden affair could help them. And therein lies the paradox: the spread of malfeasance on the Internet is the result of its openness, but this very openness may also be the best way to combat the threats. "
Security Firm Discovers Cyber-Spy Campaign,"SAN FRANCISCO - A Russian cybersecurity company issued a report on Monday saying that it had identified a sophisticated cyberespionage campaign that has been in operation since 2007. The spy campaign targeted a range of government and diplomatic organizations, mostly in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, but also in Western Europe and North America. Kaspersky Lab, the firm behind the discovery, said that digital clues suggested that the perpetrators were Russian-speaking, but that the campaign did not appear to be the work of a nation state. However, as with a number of other alarming recent reports on computer spying, Kasperky's report offered few details that would allow for independent verification and did not specifically call out the names of the organizations affected.  In an interview, Kurt Baumgartner, a senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, said that among the ""several hundreds"" of victim organizations were ""embassies, consulates and trade centers."" The vast majority of infected machines were based in Russia - where Kaspersky identified 38 infected machines - followed by Kazakhstan, where 16 infected machines were identified. Six infected machines were found in the United States. Mr. Baumgartner described the campaign as a ""sophisticated and very patient multiyear effort"" to extract geopolitical and confidential intelligence from computers, network devices like routers and switches, and smartphones. The malware was designed to extract files, e-mails and passwords from PCs, record keystrokes and take screenshots, and steal a user's Web browsing history on Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Opera browsers. It could also pilfer contacts, call histories, calendars, text messages and browsing histories from smartphones, including iPhones, Windows, Nokia, Sony, and HTC phones. And it collected information about installed software, including Oracle's database software, remote administration software and instant messaging software, like that made by Mail.Ru, a Russian e-mail and instant messaging service. But Kaspersky said what set the campaign apart was the fact that the attackers engineered their malware to steal files that have been encrypted with a classified software, called Acid Cryptofiler, that is used by several countries in the European Union and NATO to encrypt classified information. Researchers discovered several Russian words embedded in the malware's code, suggesting the attackers are of Russian-speaking origin. For instance, the word ""Zakladka"" appears in the malware, which, in Russian and Polish, can mean ""bookmark."" It is also a Russian slang term meaning ""undeclared functionality"" in computer software or hardware. Intriguingly, Kaspersky's researchers said that, in Russian, it also refers to a ""microphone embedded in a brick of the embassy building."" (The United States and Russia have a history of bugging each other's embassies.) But as sophisticated as the malware was, Kaspersky said the methods attackers used to infect systems were not. The researchers infected machines with a basic ""spearphishing"" attack, in which they sent malicious e-mails to people within targeted organizations that contained malicious Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word documents. Once opened, attackers were given full access to victims' machines through well-known security exploits that were previously used in campaigns by Chinese hackers to spy on Tibetan activists and military and energy sector targets in Asia. Mr. Baumgartner said the attackers either used well-known exploits out of ""laziness or as a clever way to hide their tracks."" The firm said attackers created more than 60 domain names and used several server locations, mainly in Germany and Russia, to manage the network of infected machines. But it said those servers were ""proxies"" designed to hide the true ""mother ship"" command and control server. Asked why Kaspersky decided not to identify the targets of the attack by name, Mr. Baumgartner said that Kaspersky's investigation was still in place.  Cybersecurity has become a significant and growing concern globally, with hackers gaining access to private corporate and military secrets, and intellectual property. Last year, Kaspersky Lab discovered several state-sponsored computer viruses including Flame, a sophisticated computer virus that spied on computers in Iran, and Gauss, a separate virus that targeted Lebanese banks. The firm said it believed both viruses were sponsored by the same nation states that created Stuxnet, a sophisticated computer virus that The New York Times has reported was a joint effort by the United States and Israel. But Kaspersky has been less forthcoming on viruses originating in its own back yard, in Russia and neighboring states, where Russian-speaking criminal syndicates control a third of the estimated $12 billion global cybercrime market, according to the Russian security firm Group-IB. But Kaspersky's latest discovery could signal a turning point. The firm nicknamed the campaign by Russian speakers ""Operation Red October"" - Rocra for short -- because it was first tipped off to the campaign in October, after one of its partners passed Kaspersky a sample of the malware used. Since then, the firm has discovered over 1,000 ""modules"" or components of the malware, with the earliest crafted in 2007 and the most recent component having been built as recently as last week. ""The attackers managed to stay in the game for over five years and evade detection of most antivirus products while continuing to exfiltrate what must be hundreds of terabytes by now,"" Kaspersky said in its report.

U.S. Demands Chinese Block Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON -- The White House demanded Monday that the Chinese government stop the widespread theft of data from American computer networks and agree to ''acceptable norms of behavior in cyberspace.'' The demand, made in a speech by President Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, was the first public confrontation with China over cyberespionage and came two days after its foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, rejected a growing body of evidence that his country's military was involved in cyberattacks on American corporations and some government agencies. The White House, Mr. Donilon said, is seeking three things from Beijing: public recognition of the urgency of the problem; a commitment to crack down on hackers in China; and an agreement to take part in a dialogue to establish global standards.  ''Increasingly, U.S. businesses are speaking out about their serious concerns about sophisticated, targeted theft of confidential business information and proprietary technologies through cyberintrusions emanating from China on an unprecedented scale,'' Mr. Donilon said in a wide-ranging address to the Asia Society in New York. ''The international community,'' he added, ''cannot tolerate such activity from any country.'' In Beijing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, did not directly say whether the government is willing to negotiate over the proposals spelled out by Mr. Donilon. But at a daily news briefing Tuesday she repeated the government's position that it opposes Internet attacks and wants ''constructive dialogue'' with the United States and other countries about cybersecurity issues. Until now, the White House has steered clear of mentioning China by name when discussing cybercrime, though Mr. Obama and other officials have raised it privately with Chinese counterparts. In his State of the Union address, he said, ''We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets.'' But as evidence has emerged suggesting the People's Liberation Army is linked to hacking, the China connection has become harder for the administration not to confront head-on. The New York Times three weeks ago published evidence tying one of the most active of the Chinese groups to a neighborhood in Shanghai that is headquarters to a major cyberunit of the People's Liberation Army. That account, based in large part on unclassified work done by Mandiant, a security firm, echoed the findings of intelligence agencies that have been tracking the Chinese attackers. American officials say raising the issue with the Chinese is a delicate balancing act at a time when the United States is seeking China's cooperation in containing North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, and joining in sanctions on Iran. Yet they have been expressing their concerns about cyberattacks with Chinese officials for years. Starting in 2010, they invited P.L.A. officials to discuss the issue -- a process that has only just started -- and last November, Mr. Obama broached the subject at a summit meeting with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, a senior administration official said. Since then, the official said, there has been a ''perfect storm'' of media coverage and protests from the corporate world. Still, he said, Mr. Donilon chose not to mention the P.L.A. in his speech because he did not want to engage in finger-pointing. ''What we are hoping to do,'' another senior official said, ''is force the Chinese civilian leadership to realize that the P.L.A. is interfering with their foreign policy.'' The Chinese have insisted that they are the victims of cyberattacks, not the perpetrators. On Saturday, the Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, issued his own call for ''rules and cooperation'' on cybersecurity and said reports of Chinese military involvement in cyberattacks were ''built on shaky ground.'' ''Anyone who tries to fabricate or piece together a sensational story to serve a political motive will not be able to blacken the name of others nor whitewash themselves,'' Mr. Yang told reporters at the National People's Congress, which was preparing to ratify the ascension of Xi Jinpingto the Chinese presidency. Mr. Donilon said the threats to cybersecurity had moved to the forefront of American concerns with China, noting that he was not ''talking about ordinary cybercrime or hacking.'' That distinction, a senior administration official said, was meant to separate the theft of intellectual property by Chinese state entities from small-scale hacking by individuals, or the use of cyberweapons by a state to protect its national security. But the distinction between cyberattacks aimed at intellectual property theft and those aimed at disabling a military threat is largely made by Western officials devising legal arguments, not one the Chinese have embraced. Even as he emphasized the need for international rules to guide cyberactivity, Mr. Donilon made no reference to the billions of dollars the American military and intelligence agencies are spending to develop an arsenal of offensive cyberweapons -- to be used against military targets, officials insist, not economic ones. The most famous of these operations was the covert cyberattack mounted by the United States and Israel to disable the centrifuges that Iran uses to enrich uranium at its site in Natanz. Mr. Donilon sketched out a vigorous agenda in Asia, insisting the United States would keep pursuing its ''strategic pivot'' toward the region, despite cuts in military spending. He announced that the Treasury Department would impose sanctions on a North Korean bank specializing in foreign-exchange transactions -- ratcheting up the pressure on the North Korean government on the day that Pyongyang announced it would no longer abide by the 1953 armistice that halted the Korean War. With fears about North Korea's increased nuclear and missile capabilities causing considerable anxiety in Seoul and Tokyo, Mr. Donilon restated a ''declaratory policy'' that was first formulated by President George W. Bush after the North's first nuclear test, in 2006. He warned that the United States would reserve the option to retaliate against the North, not just if it used nuclear weapons but if it allowed the ''transfer of nuclear weapons or nuclear materials to other states or nonstate entities.'' That formulation did not appear to cover, however, the transfer of technology to build nuclear facilities, as North Korea did in Syria. That reactor was destroyed by Israel in 2007. ''It's understandable that the people of South Korea would be concerned about the threat they face from the North,'' Mr. Donilon said, apparently alluding to talk in the South of building the country's own nuclear arsenal, a move the United States halted decades ago. Mr. Donilon added that the United States had assets in place ''to insure that South Korea's defense is provided for.'' "
Survey Highlights Data Theft Concerns for U.S. Companies in China,"BEIJING -- A quarter of companies that are members of a leading U.S. business lobby in China have been victims of data theft, a report by the group said Friday, as ties between Beijing and Washington have become increasingly strained over the threat of cyberattacks. Twenty-six percent of the members who responded to an annual survey said that their proprietary data or trade secrets had been compromised or stolen at their China operations, according to the report from the business lobby, the American Chamber of Commerce in China.  ''This poses a substantial obstacle for business in China, especially when considered alongside the concerns over I.P.R. enforcement and de facto technology transfer requirements,'' the chamber said, referring to weak enforcement of intellectual property rights. Mandiant, a U.S. computer security company, said in February that a secretive Chinese military unit was likely behind a series of hacking attacks that targeted the United States and stole data from more than 100 companies. That set off a war of words between Washington and Beijing. Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, Democrat of Maryland, said last month that U.S. companies had suffered estimated losses in 2012 of more than $300 billion due to the theft of trade secrets, much of it the result of Chinese hacking. China says the accusations lack proof and that it is also a victim of hacking attacks, more than half of which originate from the United States. Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, called the survey a ''completely irresponsible action.'' ''We hope the relevant side doesn't politicize financial and trade problems, does not exaggerate the so-called issue of online leaks and does more conducive things for China and the United States,'' Mr. Hong told reporters Friday. The survey by the chamber, commonly known as AmCham, was conducted among 325 members across China late last year, before the release of the Mandiant report. Only 10 percent of companies in the survey said they would use China-based cloud computing services, with most citing security concerns. Blocked Internet searches in China had impeded business for 62 percent of respondents. U.S. officials have pressed China to address Internet attacks and cyberspying against U.S. companies. President Barack Obama raised hacking concerns in a phone call with President Xi Jinping of China earlier in March. A recent assessment by U.S. intelligence leaders said that for the first time, cyberattacks and cyberespionage had supplanted terrorism as the top threat. Most companies in the AmCham survey expressed optimism about the business outlook in China, with many reporting higher profit margins for their China units. But companies gave lower expectations for future investment and cited rising labor costs as a top concern. Perceptions that China's investment environment is stagnating are increasing, according to the survey. Member companies ''have not felt over the last four or five years that there have been commercially significant positive changes in the business environment or the investment environment,'' Christian Murck, president of AmCham China, told reporters. ''When you have an economy which is making a transition to a market economy, but which is not yet there, there is a feeling that if you are not moving forward with an indicated path of future policy that you are effectively moving backward,'' he said at a briefing on the survey. The survey also cited a steep increase in concerns over the protection of intellectual property, like copyrights and trademarks, with 72 percent of respondents saying enforcement in China was ineffective or totally ineffective, an increase of 13 percentage points over last year. Perceptions that technology transfer was increasingly a requirement for access to China's market also jumped 10 points to 37 percent, the chamber said, with higher rates of concern reported in the aerospace, automotive, chemical in information technology sectors.

Israel Says It Repelled Most Attacks on Its Web Sites by Pro-Palestinian Hackers,"JERUSALEM -- A loose international coalition of pro-Palestinian computer hackers threatened to carry out what it called ''a massive cyberassault'' against Israel on Sunday, but the campaign created mostly minor disruptions, and the Israeli government said that as of midday its Web sites were still accessible to the public. Numerous sites, including some hosted by the government, were briefly closed down or defaced starting on Saturday evening, and some data was stolen, according to Israeli cyberexperts. On Sunday afternoon, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement that government sites were ''under DDoS attack,'' referring to Distributed Denial of Service, a method used by hackers to make sites unavailable, and that Israeli computer experts were working to repel the attacks in cooperation with Internet service providers.  The statement added that the Foreign Affairs Ministry's Web site was inaccessible ''for a few seconds before returning to normal operations'' and that generally ''a slowdown or unavailability of service could be expected from time to time.'' The Web site of Yad Vashem, Israel's official Holocaust memorial, was also hit by a cyberattack as Israel was preparing to mark its annual Holocaust Remembrance Day. Guy Mizrahi of Cyberia, an Israeli cybersecurity firm, said in an interview that the damage was not significant and that most of the attacks were ''childish.'' The shadowy network of hackers who identified themselves as belonging to the Anonymous collective, along with various allied groups, announced last week that ''elite cybersquadrons from around the world'' had decided to unite to ''disrupt and erase Israel from cyberspace.'' Among other things, they blamed Israel for violating the November cease-fire in Gaza by carrying out airstrikes, a reference to the assaults on Tuesday on two open areas in northern Gaza that caused no damage or casualties. Israel said the strikes were in response to a renewal of rocket fire into southern Israel. Israel has been working to protect itself from cyberattacks, establishing a National Cyber Bureau in early 2012 to coordinate computer security efforts. Isaac Ben Israel of the National Cyber Bureau told Israel Radio on Sunday that Israel ''has always been more prepared than other places in the world.'' ''When we talk about cyberwar we are talking about attacks on water, electricity, infrastructure, but Anonymous does not have that kind of ability,'' he said. ''The fact that we don't have any big damage is not because there are no attacks. We see the attacks, and they are blocked.'' Pro-Israeli hackers, some working under the name Israeli Elite Force, said they had retaliated by posting pro-Israeli messages on Web sites in the Muslim world. The pro-Palestinian hackers called their campaign Operation Israel. Activists logged and tracked their progress through a Twitter account, #OpIsrael. But some of the sites in Israel that the hackers had claimed to have brought down -- like the ones hosted by Coca-Cola, the prime minister's office and Invest in Israel, an initiative of the Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry, appeared to be working on Sunday. The pro-Palestinian hackers seemed to have had more success in attacking small businesses and individual Facebook pages. At midday they announced on Twitter that they had defaced the Web site of an Israeli hair salon, Peter Hair, in Ramat Hasharon, near Tel Aviv. The salon site's home page showed a person with a masked face, an image associated with Anonymous, holding a sign saying ''Indonesian Security Down #OP ISRAHELL.'' The rest of the screen was filled with a message to the government, accusing Israel of having ''wronged humanity.'' The hackers signed off with the message, ''We are Muslims, Soldier of Allah.'' Reached by telephone on Sunday evening, the owner of the salon, Peter Imseis, said he had not been aware that the site had been hacked and added that it had not affected his business. Asked why he thought the salon had become a target, he said, ''I don't have a clue. It's very strange.'' "
Campuses Face Rising Threat From Hackers,"America's research universities, among the most open and robust centers of information exchange in the world, are increasingly coming under cyberattack, most of it thought to be from China, with millions of hacking attempts weekly. Campuses are being forced to tighten security, constrict their culture of openness and try to determine what has been stolen. University officials concede that some of the hacking attempts have succeeded. But they have declined to reveal specifics, other than those involving the theft of personal data like Social Security numbers. They acknowledge that they often do not learn of break-ins until much later, if ever, and that even after discovering the breaches they may not be able to tell what was taken. Universities and their professors are awarded thousands of patents each year, some with vast potential value, in fields as disparate as prescription drugs, computer chips, fuel cells, aircraft and medical devices.  ''The attacks are increasing exponentially, and so is the sophistication, and I think it's outpaced our ability to respond,'' said Rodney J. Petersen, who heads the cybersecurity program at Educause, a nonprofit alliance of schools and technology companies. ''So everyone's investing a lot more resources in detecting this, so we learn of even more incidents we wouldn't have known about before.'' Tracy B. Mitrano, the director of information technology policy at Cornell University, said that detection was ''probably our greatest area of concern, that the hackers' ability to detect vulnerabilities and penetrate them without being detected has increased sharply.'' Like many of her counterparts, she said that while the largest number of attacks appeared to have originated in China, hackers have become adept at bouncing their work around the world. Officials do not know whether the hackers are private or governmental. A request for comment from the Chinese Embassy in Washington was not immediately answered. Analysts can track where communications come from -- a region, a service provider, sometimes even a user's specific Internet address. But hackers often route their penetration attempts through multiple computers, even multiple countries, and the targeted organizations rarely go to the effort and expense -- often fruitless -- of trying to trace the origins. American government officials, security experts and university and corporate officials nonetheless say that China is clearly the leading source of efforts to steal information, but attributing individual attacks to specific people, groups or places is rare. The increased threat of hacking has forced many universities to rethink the basic structure of their computer networks and their open style, though officials say they are resisting the temptation to create a fortress with high digital walls. ''A university environment is very different from a corporation or a government agency, because of the kind of openness and free flow of information you're trying to promote,'' said David J. Shaw, the chief information security officer at Purdue University. ''The researchers want to collaborate with others, inside and outside the university, and to share their discoveries.'' Some universities no longer allow their professors to take laptops to certain countries, and that should be a standard practice, said James A. Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy group in Washington. ''There are some countries, including China, where the minute you connect to a network, everything will be copied, or something will be planted on your computer in hopes that you'll take that computer back home and connect to your home network, and then they're in there,'' he said. ''Academics aren't used to thinking that way.'' Bill Mellon of the University of Wisconsin said that when he set out to overhaul computer security recently, he was stunned by the sheer volume of hacking attempts. ''We get 90,000 to 100,000 attempts per day, from China alone, to penetrate our system,'' said Mr. Mellon, the associate dean for research policy. ''There are also a lot from Russia, and recently a lot from Vietnam, but it's primarily China.'' Other universities report a similar number of attacks and say the figure is doubling every few years. What worries them most is the growing sophistication of the assault. For corporations, cyberattacks have become a major concern, as they find evidence of persistent hacking by well-organized groups around the world -- often suspected of being state-sponsored -- that are looking to steal information that has commercial, political or national security value. The New York Times disclosed in January that hackers with possible links to the Chinese military had penetrated its computer systems, apparently looking for the sources of material embarrassing to China's leaders. This kind of industrial espionage has become a sticking point in United States-China relations, with the Obama administration complaining of organized cybertheft of trade secrets, and Chinese officials pointing to revelations of American spying. Like major corporations, universities develop intellectual property that can turn into valuable products like prescription drugs or computer chips. But university systems are harder to secure, with thousands of students and staff members logging in with their own computers. Mr. Shaw, of Purdue, said that he and many of his counterparts had accepted that the external shells of their systems must remain somewhat porous. The most sensitive data can be housed in the equivalent of smaller vaults that are harder to access and harder to move within, use data encryption, and sometimes are not even connected to the larger campus network, particularly when the work involves dangerous pathogens or research that could turn into weapons systems. ''It's sort of the opposite of the corporate structure,'' which is often tougher to enter but easier to navigate, said Paul Rivers, manager of system and network security at the University of California, Berkeley. ''We treat the overall Berkeley network as just as hostile as the Internet outside.'' Berkeley's cybersecurity budget, already in the millions of dollars, has doubled since last year, responding to what Larry Conrad, the associate vice chancellor and chief information officer, said were ''millions of attempted break-ins every single week.'' Mr. Shaw, who arrived at Purdue last year, said, ''I've had no resistance to any increased investment in security that I've advocated so far.'' Mr. Mellon, at Wisconsin, said his university was spending more than $1 million to upgrade computer security in just one program, which works with infectious diseases. Along with increased spending has come an array of policy changes, often after consultation with the F.B.I. Every research university contacted said it was in frequent contact with the bureau, which has programs specifically to advise universities on safeguarding data. The F.B.I. did not respond to requests to discuss those efforts. Not all of the potential threats are digital. In April, a researcher from China who was working at the Medical College of Wisconsin was arrested and charged with trying to steal a cancer-fighting compound and related data. Last year, Mr. Mellon said, Wisconsin began telling faculty members not to take their laptops and cellphones abroad, for fear of hacking. Most universities have not gone that far, but many say they have become more vigilant about urging professors to follow federal rules that prohibit taking some kinds of sensitive data out of the country, or have imposed their own restrictions, tighter than the government's. Still others require that employees returning from abroad have their computers scrubbed by professionals. That kind of precaution has been standard for some corporations and government agencies for a few years, but it is newer to academia. Information officers say they have also learned the hard way that when a software publisher like Oracle or Microsoft announces that it has discovered a security vulnerability and has developed a ''patch'' to correct it, systems need to apply the patch right away. As soon as such a hole is disclosed, hacker groups begin designing programs to take advantage of it, hoping to release new attacks before people and organizations get around to installing the patch. ''The time between when a vulnerability is announced and when we see attempts to exploit it has become extremely small,'' said Mr. Conrad, of Berkeley. ''It's days. Sometimes hours.'' "
Swartz Suicide Fuels Argument Over 1986 Computer Law,"The suicide of Aaron Swartz has drawn new scrutiny to a federal law that has been widely used to prosecute a variety of people accused of being trolls, bullies and cyberthieves.  The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, enacted in 1986, is the basis for much of the government's case against Mr. Swartz. It makes it illegal to gain access to a computer system without ""authorization."" The Department of Justice had argued that Mr. Swartz lacked ""authorization"" when he got into the computer network of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to download academic articles from its online archive, called JSTOR. The blogosphere buzzed with arguments on Monday over the scope and application of the law. A  went up Monday afternoon, pressing the Obama administration to reform the Fraud Act. ""The act is far too broad and is subject to prosecutorial abuse and inappropriate use,"" it read. The case for revamping the law was made most forcefully by Marcia Hoffman, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco, who described the law as ""vague and overbroad"" and its punishment disproportionately harsh. ""The CFAA's vague language, broad reach, and harsh punishments combine to create a powerful weapon for overeager prosecutors to unleash on people they don't like,"" she wrote. Acounterargument came from Orin Kerr, a George Washington University law professor, writing in the legal blog, the Volkh Conspiracy, that federal prosecutors had based their prosecution on ""a fair reading of the law."" Tim Wu, writing on the Web site of The New Yorker,  that a law meant for serious intrusions was misapplied to a ""reckless young man."" The  Justice Department dropped the charges on Monday. ""Just in time,""  Harper Reed, who served as the chief technology officer for President Obama's re-election campaign, on Twitter.  "
Biometric Technology Takes Off,"The use of biological markers like fingerprints, faces and irises to identify people is rapidly moving from science fiction to reality. Apple's latest iPhone, which went on sale this week, can be unlocked with a fingerprint. Users of Android smartphones can unlock their devices with a glance. And the Federal Bureau of Investigation is developing facial recognition technology that would allow it to pinpoint criminals and suspects in large crowds of people with closed-circuit cameras.  Once so expensive that it was used only by the military or high-tech companies, biometric technology has become so commonplace that even some schools and hospitals are using it. Its adoption could make sensitive information more secure than conventional identification cards or passwords, which can be easily forgotten, lost or hacked. But it also has the potential to undermine privacy, which has been greatly compromised by recent revelations about government surveillance of phone and Internet communications. In fact, biometrics are not as safe as is often thought. A 2010 report from the National Research Council concluded that such systems are ''inherently fallible'' because they identify people within certain degrees of certainty and because biological markers are relatively easy to copy. For example, people leave their fingerprints on everything they touch, which makes those fingerprints available to any determined spy or law enforcement agent. Experts have shown that fingerprints and other markers can be copied, giving hackers and thieves access to private information. And once compromised, fingerprints cannot be reset, like passwords, or replaced, like passports. If proper safeguards are not put in place, the use of some biometrics, like facial-recognition technology, can also be used to conduct intrusive surveillance of individuals or groups of people by governments and private companies. Using facial-recognition software to match databases of photos with images from security cameras in public spaces and private buildings can help law enforcement agencies spot and track dangerous criminals. But the same technology can just as easily be abused to target political activists or protesters. Retailers could use such systems to snoop on their customers' shopping behavior so that they could later target specific ads and offers to those customers. Facebook already uses software to determine whether photos that users upload to the site contain the images of their friends, though the company does let users opt out of the system. Even as the use of such technology has expanded rapidly, there has been little public debate about its use. Most federal and state laws do not directly address the collection and use of biological markers by businesses and the government. Some lawmakers, like Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, have asked the F.B.I. and companies like Apple and Facebook to explain how they use biometrics. But Congress must do more by enacting legislation that governs how this technology is used, to make sure it does not compromise privacy rights. "
Iran's View of Cyberwarfare,"To the Editor: Re ''Cyberattacks on the Rise Against U.S. Corporations'' (news article, May 13): Although Iran has been the recipient of protracted waves of state-sponsored cyberattacks attempting to target Iran's civilian nuclear facilities, power grids, oil terminals and other industrial sectors, it has never taken countermeasures against the perpetrators of cyberattacks. Nor, contrary to the article's assertion, has Iran ever engaged in such attacks against its Persian Gulf neighbors, with which Iran has maintained good neighborly relations.  Unfortunately, wrongful acts such as authorizing the 2010 Stuxnet attack against Iran have set a bad, and dangerous, precedent in breach of certain principles of international law. This also ignores the United Nations Charter's principle of refraining from threat or use of force in international relations, which definitely entails responsibility for its consequences. Iran, as the current head of the Non-Aligned Movement and a responsible member of the international community, has been at the forefront of calling for the strengthening of international legal instruments against cyberwarfare. Cybersecurity is a global issue, transcending national boundaries, and therefore it requires collective efforts of responsible states to reach a comprehensive international agreement similar to other arrangements on nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.

An Elizabethan Cyberwar,"Jordan Chandler Hirsch, a former staff editor at Foreign Affairs, and Sam Adelsberg, a fellow at the Yale Information Society Project, are students at Yale Law School. NEW HAVEN -- AS Barack Obama and China's president, Xi Jinping, prepare to meet in California next week, America's relations with China are feeling increasingly like the cold war -- especially when it comes to cybersecurity. With the two countries accusing each other of breaking the old rules of the game, a new breed of ''cyberhawks'' on both sides are arguing for cold-war-like escalation that could turn low-level cyberconflict into total war.  But treating today's Beijing like Brezhnev's Moscow distorts the nature of the threat and how Washington should respond to it. In confronting today's cyberbattles, the United States should think less about Soviets and more about pirates. Indeed, today's cybercompetition is less like the cold war than the battle for the New World. In the era after the discovery of the Americas, European states fought for mastery over the Atlantic. Much like the Internet today, the ocean then was a primary avenue for trade and communication that no country could cordon off. At that time, the Spanish empire boasted a fearsome navy, but it could not dominate the seas. Poorer and weaker England tested Spain's might by encouraging and equipping would-be pirates to act on its behalf without official sanction. These semi-state-sponsored privateers robbed Spain of gold and pride as they raided ships off the coasts of the New World and Spain itself, enriching the English crown while augmenting its naval power. Spain's inability to attribute the attacks directly to England allowed Queen Elizabeth I to level the playing field in an arena lacking laws or customs. Today's cyberbattles aren't so different. Next week's summit takes place amid reports of increasingly sophisticated Chinese cyberespionage. Earlier this week, evidence surfaced that Chinese hackers had gained access to several top-secret Pentagon programs. That followed news that cyberunits believed to be linked to the Chinese Army have resumed attacks on American businesses and government agencies. As tensions deepen, hawkish Chinese military leaders are paving the way for offensive war. A study by a RAND Corporation expert cited Chinese sources calling for pre-emptive cyberstrikes ''under the rubric of the rising Chinese strategy of xianfa zhiren, or 'gaining mastery before the enemy has struck.' '' And a recent paper found that Chinese military officials have contemplated using cyberweapons like Stuxnet, which the United States and Israel deployed against Iran's nuclear program, to target critical infrastructure. American policy makers are beginning to view their cyberstruggle with China through a cold war lens. One Pentagon official recently said that while during the cold war America focused ''on the nuclear command centers around Moscow,'' today American leaders ''worry as much about the computer servers in Shanghai.'' Another senior official declared that ''the Cold War enforced norms, and the Soviets and the United States didn't go outside a set of boundaries.'' But, he argued, ''China is going outside those boundaries now.'' Among those who view these hostilities as the cold war redux, some are proposing a more strident response. Earlier this year, the United States military announced the formation of 13 units dedicated to offensive cyberstrikes and endorsed pre-emptive cyberattacks. And late last month, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former ambassador to China, and Dennis C. Blair, the former director of national intelligence, suggested allowing American companies to retaliate against Chinese hackers on their own. This emergence of cyberhawks in both nations raises the odds of a hack's becoming a cyberwar. These voices could pressure both nations to treat any escalating cyberconflict as a latter-day Cuban missile crisis. But the cold war model of a struggle with calibrated boundaries, clear rules, and the threat of mutual assured destruction simply doesn't fit cyberspace. The first major difference is terrain. The United States and the Soviet Union fought for global influence, manning divisions here and infiltrating covert operatives there. The Internet is more fluid. Neither the United States nor China can slice cyberspace into the reassuring structure of spheres of influence. With no obvious borders for states to violate or defend, power in cyberspace is at once easier to exercise and harder to maintain, a battle of subtleties rather than hard-nosed deterrence. There are also more players today. The United States and the Soviet Union were the world's unmatched nuclear powers. But in the cyberrealm, the United States and China stand only just ahead of other nations, hacker groups and individuals in their ability to inflict damage. And all of these actors can hide behind layers of networks and third parties, making it difficult to discover not only who attacked but also how and when. There will, in most cases, be plausible deniability. Even if American and Chinese policy makers wanted to manage the Web as carefully as their predecessors did the cold war, no working group could tame this instability. With nations still navigating how to interact on the Web and arguments persisting about whether international law applies to the Internet, there are few established customs of cyberbehavior, legal or implicit. The United States should not expect China to follow the rules of a previous era. The norms of American-Soviet conflict, which themselves emerged out of years of gunpoint diplomacy, can't be grafted onto cyberspace. If American policy makers continue to define the cyberstruggle between Washington and Beijing as a new cold war, they will not meet the challenge. Viewing China's actions through an obsolete lens will give them a distorted sense of its intentions. And it will limit American retaliation to the outmoded rules of a bygone battle. If they must look to the past, they should heed the lessons of the 16th century, not the 20th. In 1588, the Spanish crown, in no small part due to its frustration with English piracy, resorted to massive retaliation, sending its armada to overthrow Queen Elizabeth. That move ended in disaster and an overwhelming English victory. Instead of trying to beat back the New World instability of the Internet with an old playbook, American officials should embrace it. With the conflict placed in its proper perspective, policy makers could ratchet down the rhetoric and experiment with a new range of responses that go beyond condemnation but stop short of all-out cyberwar -- giving them the room to maneuver without approaching cyberconflict as a path to Defcon 1. In these legally uncharted waters, only Elizabethan guile, not cold war brinkmanship, will steer Washington through the storm. "
N.S.A. Chief Says Phone Record Logs Halted Terror Threats,"WASHINGTON -- The director of the National Security Agency told Congress on Wednesday that ''dozens'' of terrorism threats had been halted by the agency's huge database of the logs of nearly every domestic phone call made by Americans, while a senator briefed on the program disclosed that the telephone records are destroyed after five years. The director, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, who heads both the N.S.A. and United States Cyber Command, which runs the military's offensive and defensive use of cyberweapons, told skeptical members of the Senate Appropriations Committee that his agency was doing exactly what Congress authorized after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. General Alexander said he welcomed debate over the legal justification for the program because ''what we're doing to protect American citizens here is the right thing.'' He said the agency ''takes great pride in protecting this nation and our civil liberties and privacy'' under the oversight of Congress and the courts.  ''We aren't trying to hide it,'' he said. ''We're trying to protect America. So we need your help in doing that. This isn't something that's just N.S.A. or the administration doing it on its own. This is what our nation expects our government to do for us.'' But in his spirited exchanges with committee members, notably Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, General Alexander said he was seeking to declassify many details about the program now that they have been leaked by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor who came forward to say he was the source of documents about the phone log program and other classified matters. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was the first to disclose that the records are eventually destroyed. She said that she planned to hold a classified hearing on Thursday on the program. But at the Wednesday hearing, where testimony about the government's planned $13 billion spending on cybersecurity was largely swept aside for a discussion of the surveillance program, Ms. Feinstein also revealed that investigators had used the database for purposes beyond countering terrorism, suggesting it might have also been employed in slowing Iran's nuclear program. Analysts can look at the domestic calling data only if there is a reason to suspect it is ''actually related to Al Qaeda or to Iran,'' she said, adding: ''The vast majority of the records in the database are never accessed and are deleted after a period of five years. To look at or use the content of a call, a court warrant must be obtained.'' In a robust defense of the phone program, General Alexander said that it had been critical in helping to prevent ''dozens of terrorist attacks'' both in the United States and abroad and that the intelligence community was considering declassifying examples to better explain the program. He did not clarify whether the records used in such investigations would have been available through individual subpoenas without the database. He also later walked back the assertion slightly, saying the phone log database was used in conjunction with other programs. In his testimony, General Alexander said he had ''grave concerns'' about how Mr. Snowden had access to such a wide range of top-secret information, from the details of a secret program called Prism to speed the government's search of Internet materials to a presidential document on cyberstrategy. He said the entire intelligence community was looking at the security of its networks -- something other government officials vowed to do after the WikiLeaks disclosures three years ago. Under the Prism program, the N.S.A. collects information from American Internet companies like Google without individual court orders if the request is targeted at noncitizens abroad. That program derives from a 2008 surveillance law that was openly debated in Congress. As part of the review from the fallout of leaks about Prism and the phone program, intelligence agencies will seek to determine whether terrorist suspects have increased their use of code words or couriers, have stopped using networks like Facebook or Skype, or have ''gone silent'' and can no longer be found, current and former senior American officials said separately from the hearing. The review, which will most likely last for months to determine the long-term impact of the disclosures by Mr. Snowden, will also include a ''cost benefit analysis'' of the programs. ''Now that it's out there, it will be looked at in a different way,'' one of the current officials said. ''Everyone's raising questions about whether they have been compromised and whether to continue with them at the same pace. They are wondering whether or not they are going to continue to yield good information.'' While senior intelligence officials -- including James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence -- have asserted that the disclosures have significantly damaged the government's intelligence capabilities, the current and former officials were far less sure of the lasting impact. Philip Mudd, a former F.B.I. deputy director for national security, said that there could be some short-term impact on the programs but that terrorists would find it very hard to function without using electronic communications. ''Good luck trying to communicate in this world without leaving a digital exhaust -- that's not going to happen,'' he said. Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, called for the prosecution of journalists who published the classified information in the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden. Mr. King told Fox News he was specifically talking about Glenn Greenwald, the columnist for The Guardian, whom he accused of threatening to release the names of covert C.I.A. agents. On Twitter, Mr. Greenwald said it was a ''lie'' that he had made such a threat, and shot back with a reference to Mr. King's past support for the Irish Republican Army: ''Only in America can a renowned and devoted terrorism supporter like Peter King be the arbiter of national security and treason,'' he wrote. Public opinion, judging by two polls with differently worded questions that yielded different results, is divided over the government's tracking of the communications of Americans. In a Pew Research Center/Washington Post poll conducted June 6-9, 56 percent of Americans said the N.S.A's program tracking the phone records of ''millions of Americans'' was an acceptable way to investigate terrorism, while 41 percent said it was unacceptable. But a CBS News poll conducted June 9-10, which instead asked about collecting phone records of ''ordinary Americans,'' found that just 38 percent supported it and 58 percent opposed it. "
Obama Discusses Computer Security With Corporate Chiefs,"WASHINGTON - President Obama met with an invited group of 13 chief executives at the White House on Wednesday to discuss growing concerns about cybersecurity and enlist them to get behind his proposed legislation to combat the threat of computer warfare and corporate espionage.  Among those present were Rex W. Tillerson of Exxon Mobil, Randall L. Stephenson of AT&T, Wesley G. Bush of Northrop Grumman, Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America, and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, which had been attacked by foreign hackers as recently as Tuesday.    White House officials said the meeting in the White House Situation Room was designed as a ""two way"" information exchange. Aides said Mr. Obama wanted to hear directly from industry leaders about how vulnerable their companies were to computer attacks. The president also wanted to discuss efforts the government was taking to address threats.  ""He has seen as various corporations and business leaders have gone public with their concerns about cybersecurity and the effects of breaches of cybersecurity on their operations,"" said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary.  In recent weeks, Apple, Twitter, Facebook, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have all stepped forward to say that their computer systems had been attacked. And since September, online banking sites of several American banks have been intermittently pulled offline by attacks that officials say originated in Iran. But the president is also looking to drum up public support as he makes a renewed push for legislation that would give the administration new technological tools and broader authority in the battle against computer attacks by foreign governments. The president's previous bill was killed by a Republican filibuster last year after intensive lobbying by the United States Chamber of Commerce and other business groups, which argued that the legislation would prove onerous.  ""He also wants to convey to them how seriously he takes this issue and what he believes the right steps are moving forward,"" Mr. Carney said. ""And he certainly hopes that out of this meeting and the many others he has on this topic, that we will build the kind of consensus necessary to compel Congress to take appropriate action."" The meeting Wednesday, which also included chief executives from American Electric Power, Xerox, Marathon Oil, Honeywell, United Parcel Service, ITT Exelis, Siemens and Frontier Communications, was just the latest step in the administration's campaign to persuade Congress to pass a computer security bill.  In recent months, several senior administration officials - including Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security; Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - have provided closed-door briefings to members of Congress about the threat. As a stopgap measure,the president signed an executive order last month that promotes increased the sharing of information between the government and private companies.   The president has also been making his case directly to the public in speeches and media appearances in recent months. In his State of the Union speech, Mr. Obama spent more time on the topic of computer attacks than he did on North Korea and Iran combined.  In an interview on ABC News broadcast on Wednesday, Mr. Obama was careful to avoid saying that the United States is engaged in a computer war with China. He said officials need to ""be careful with war analogies"" in discussions about the topics. But the president said that billions of dollars are lost when industrial secrets are stolen online. And he said that some of the attacks on the nation's private and public computer networks are sponsored by foreign governments. ""Our companies are put into competitive disadvantage. You know, there are disruptions to our systems that, you know, involve everything from our financial systems to some of our infrastructure,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And this is why I've taken some very aggressive executive actions. But we need Congress to act."" He said that the government is limited in what it can do to confront China and other sponsors of computer attacks. And he said the government needs the authority to require that critical infrastructure in the country is hardened against such attacks. ""There are ways that we can harden our critical infrastructure, our financial sector,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And the only thing that's holding us back from doing that right now is we haven't gotten the legislative authority out of Congress. They need to get this done.""  "
Tough Times at Homeland Security,"A new wave of cyberattacks is hitting American companies at a particularly vulnerable time for the Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency charged with fending them off. That is because the department has been grappling with the departures of its top cybersecurity officials. In the last four months, Jane Holl Lute, the agency's deputy secretary; Mark Weatherford, the top cybersecurity official; Michael Locatis, the assistant secretary for cybersecurity; and Richard Spires, the chief information officer, have all resigned.  Candidates currently being considered to fill their posts include Beltway officials and executives from the antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee, according to people briefed on their professional backgrounds who were not authorized to speak publicly about the department's hiring process. But these people said the leading candidates lacked critical ties to Silicon Valley and to the hacking community from which Homeland Security has said it so urgently needs to recruit. For the last four years, the department has said it needs to expand its cybersecurity force by as many as 600 skilled hackers if it is to keep pace with the influx of increasingly sophisticated threats. ""We need students,"" Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, told students at San Jose State University last year. ""We need young people who really understand this technology who are creative and innovative."" But in the last 10 years, most students who graduated from the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service program, a National Science Foundation program that awards scholarships to students with cyberskills in exchange for a federal service commitment, went to the National Security Agency, where they work on offensive missions. At Homeland Security, the emphasis is on keeping hackers out, or playing defense. Ms. Napolitano convened a 15-person task force last year to figure out how to attract more students. The task force included security experts from Facebook, the N.S.A. and the Idaho National Laboratory, the Energy Department's lead nuclear research center. Its co-chairman was Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a security training organization, and Jeff Moss, founder of the well-known Black Hat and Def Con annual hacking conventions in Las Vegas. Among their recommendations: Make Homeland Security cool again by partnering with the organizers of hacking competitions, whose participants would much prefer to ""move fast and break things"" at Facebook or Twitter or Google, than cut through red tape at the Department of Homeland Security. To make the department more than a bureaucratic afterthought, people inside the agency say they hope it will fill one of its top vacancies with a hacker ""rock star"" not unlike Mr. Moss, whose Las Vegas conferences annually draw the best minds in computer security, or Peiter Zatko, the hacker better known as Mudge, who recently left his position at the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, for Google. ""Where is cyber at D.H.S. right now?"" one person at the agency remarked. ""Who is minding the shop? And what have we been talking about for the past four years?""  "
Digital Tools To Curb Snooping,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Let's be clear. Your personal information online is not always yours to control. Thieves could grab a Social Security number stored unencrypted in a doctor's computer; the National Security Agency could order an e-mail provider to unlock correspondence; even the phone company could supply the police with a map of your whereabouts for the last several months. For now, short of living in a cave without a cellphone, there are no fail-proof technological tricks to avoid this exposure. But there are a variety of tools to minimize your digital footprint. Some of these tools cost money, making digital privacy something of a luxury for those who can afford it. Others are free. But all of them take effort and awareness.  ''A lot of people say, 'I don't have anything to hide,' '' said Mike Janke, chief executive of Silent Circle, a company outside Washington that markets a private communications tool to individuals and businesses. ''I say, 'Tell me the last time you had a private conversation -- or thought you did.' '' PROTECTING PASSWORDS Experts say never to use the same password on multiple sites. Reality says that following that advice is nearly impossible. But keeping strong and safe passwords, which means keeping multiple passwords, is crucial to protecting accounts. A relatively safe bet is to use a password manager. They generate random passwords and store them in an encrypted safe, to which only you have the key, usually in the form of a master password. Several are available, including Dashlane, LastPass and RoboForm; some work better than others on mobile devices. Apple's new operating system, iOS 7, includes a so-called Password Generator that can produce ''a unique, hard-to-guess password'' as well as ''remember it for you.'' Two-step authentication is another worthwhile safeguard. Many large Web companies, including Google and Yahoo, along with recently breached services like LinkedIn, now offer this option. If you turn on two-step authentication, entering a user name and password sends a code to your phone by voice mail or text message. The service then requires that you enter the sent code. It takes extra time to set up and use the system, but far less than it would take to clean up a thief's mess. TRICKING THE TRACKERS Whether it is to avoid peeping criminals or advertising networks, there are several options for keeping your browser history to yourself. Tracker blocking tools let you see the companies tracking your activities on the Web, and to block them if you wish. Some of the popular blocking tools include Ghostery, Disconnect and Abine. To the dismay of advertisers, some browser makers now offer consumers a way to block so-called third-party cookies, tiny pieces of code that track where you go on the Web. Forrester Research estimates that 27 percent of Web users have used an ad blocking tool, a sharp increase from recent years. It is possible to take much stronger steps, too, and Tor is one of the most popular options. Originally developed for the Navy, and used by agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tor's browser prevents Web sites from knowing who you are by rerouting Web traffic through a series of other points. Using Tor with your e-mail service, for instance, would most likely prevent a government agency from detecting your Internet Protocol address, though not from compelling a service provider to turn over your messages. Orbot offers an equivalent for the Android operating system; there is nothing for iOS. A virtual private network, or VPN, can also help blur your tracks. It creates an encrypted tunnel between your computer and the VPN's server, obscuring your Web browsing to others, including your Internet service provider. But some VPNs log your Internet traffic, compiling a rich history of your Web travels. HTTPS Everywhere, a browser extension, takes you to secure, encrypted versions of Web sites wherever possible, protecting you from eavesdroppers, for instance, when you are using public Wi-Fi. If you do not want Google or Bing (the two main search engines) to compile your search history data, there is the upstart search engine called DuckDuckGo. Its founder, Gabriel Weinberg, says his company has no interest in saving user search history. The company makes money by serving advertisements based on the keywords searched, right then and there, and discards the search history. So if the government asks for user information (that hasn't happened yet, he said), it will not get much. ''If the data doesn't exist, there's nothing to hand over,'' he said. TRUSTING THE CLOUD Lawyers sometimes like to say that the digital cloud has fundamentally changed the relationship between citizens and their governments. If the police wanted to inspect your work files in the past, a search warrant was required to enter your office. Now, the police can turn to the cloud service you use to store work files. But when SpiderOak, of San Francisco, receives these inquiries, it cannot offer anything legible. Its customers' files are not only encrypted, but users' plain text passwords are not transmitted to the company. ''Most companies ask you to trust them,'' said Ethan Oberman, its chief executive. ''Our theory is you don't have to trust us.'' The service costs $10 a month for 100 gigabytes of storage. KEEPING CONVERSATIONS PRIVATE An e-mail is like a postcard -- it can be easy for others to read. And an e-mail provider's promise of encryption provides little comfort. For starters, when a message is sent from a Gmail user to a Yahoo user, for example, it travels on the wide open highway of the Internet, vulnerable to theft. And a government can order an e-mail provider to unlock the correspondence -- whether through a search warrant from police agencies or a National Security Letter from an intelligence agency. Moxie Marlinspike, a security researcher, uses the analogy of an offline lock and key. ''Let's say the door to my house is locked, but I keep the key Scotch-taped next to it,'' he said. Anyone who can grab the key can get in. P.G.P., or Pretty Good Privacy, is one system to encrypt e-mail communications, but it is relatively complicated to use. The brains behind that tool have now come together to form Silent Circle, the company run by Mr. Janke. In addition to encrypted e-mail -- which Mr. Janke admits is the company's least secure product -- Silent Circle also offers encrypted phone, text messaging, file transfer and video chat services. The user gets a 10-digit phone number that works on Android or Apple devices. The company does not keep a log of phone calls, which means that a law enforcement request even for so-called metadata is likely to be futile. A decryption key is produced for a phone call, video chat or text message made using its service; once the message is received, the key is deleted. But there is a serious hitch: the extra protection works only if both parties are using Silent Circle. The service costs $10 a month. Mr. Marlinspike has also developed an encrypted text messaging app, TextSecure, now available on Android. Off the Record is another encrypted instant message service. RedPhone, built by Mr. Marlinspike, encrypts calls from end to end, and keeps no data itself, meaning that no telephone carrier can keep a record of those you talk to or comply with a wiretap order to monitor your phone calls. KoolSpan, a Bethesda, Md., company, offers its encrypted phone and data service to law firms, which are especially interested in safeguarding their client communications from hackers; former Attorney General John Ashcroft's firm, the Ashcroft Group, is a client. REMEMBERING THE BASICS Even the most advanced privacy tools might not work, though, if the basics are ignored. And perhaps the most basic safeguard of all -- the equivalent of hand-washing in digital hygiene -- is to keep software updated. A host of known security bugs are often fixed with each release, and ignoring those sometimes annoying calls to update are done at your peril. "
Preventing a U.S.-China Cyberwar,"When President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China have their first meeting next month in California, addressing the issue of China's cyberattacks on American institutions will be an important priority. Both nations need to take steps to avoid drifting into an all-out cyberwar.  Despite Beijing's denials, there is little doubt that Chinese hackers have taken aim at a range of government and private systems in the United States, including the power grid and telecommunications networks. In February, a report by the computer security firm Mandiant detailed how hackers working for the People's Liberation Army of China had gained access to data from American companies and government agencies. Earlier this month, a Pentagon report explicitly accused the Chinese military of the attacks. With the evidence of their activities mounting, Chinese hackers went silent for three months, but, they now seem to have resumed their attacks. A report last week by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, a private group led by two former Obama administration officials -- Dennis Blair, who was the director of intelligence, and Jon Huntsman Jr., an ambassador to China -- said that hacking costs the American economy more than $300 billion a year and that China was responsible for 70 percent of the theft of corporate intellectual property and trade secrets. While there are concerns about military-related incursions, the focus of most public discussion surrounds hacking into business and industry. The commission's report spoke of the risk of ''stifling innovation'' in America and elsewhere if hackers in China are able to steal blueprints and negotiation strategies. The Chinese complain that they, too, have suffered cyberattacks. That could offer some basis for cooperating with Washington on norms of behavior. China recently agreed to an Obama administration proposal to create a working group on cyberissues. The commission said the American response was ''utterly inadequate'' and proposed stronger ways to deter Chinese hacking, like possibly allowing companies to retaliate against attackers with their own counterstrikes. But before adopting punitive measures, the two nations need to try working together. For example, the EastWest Institute, an independent research group, is working with representatives of many governments, including China and the United States, to develop ground rules for protecting the digital infrastructure. The group's detailed proposal on fighting spam -- which carries malware used by hackers -- is worth considering by President Obama and President Xi. "
Closing the Door on Hackers,"Marc Maiffret is the chief technology officer of BeyondTrust, an enterprise security management company. IRVINE, Calif. FOR most of my teenage years, I made a hobby of hacking into some of the world's largest government and corporate computer systems. I was ''lucky'' enough to be raided by the F.B.I. when I was 17 years old. After that wake-up call, I eventually started a software security company and now find myself helping to plug security holes, not exploit them. The nature of hacking has changed, too, since I left it in the late 1990s -- from a game of curiosity and occasional activism into a central tool in cybercrime and nation-state attacks.  Alongside that shift has come a loud and often misguided conversation about what to do to stop this new breed of hacking. Too much of the debate begins and ends with the perpetrators and the victims of cyberattacks, and not enough is focused on the real problem: the insecure software or technology that allows such attacks to succeed. Instead of focusing solely on employees who accidentally open e-mails, we should also be pressuring software makers to make significant investments in their products' security. When you read headlines about the latest cyberattack, you typically do not hear about how attackers were able to put a virus or other malware on a system in the first place. In many cases, it begins with attackers exploiting a software vulnerability or weakness in order to install their malware. The unspoken truth is that for the most part, large software companies are not motivated to make software secure. It's a question of investment priorities: they care more about staying competitive with their products, and that means developing the latest features and functions that consumers and businesses are looking to buy. Security issues are often treated more as a marketing challenge than an engineering one. A result is an open door to hackers inside some of the world's most popular software systems. Perhaps most famously, during the early to middle parts of the last decade, hackers discovered a significant number of glaring security weaknesses in Microsoft products (some of which were discovered by my company). Several of these weaknesses were exploited in high-profile computer virus and worm attacks. To be fair, securing software is not a trivial task. Often it means building in multiple barriers to entry and keeping those defenses current with the latest developments in hacker techniques. Security has to be a central and significant investment in any software development project. Still, given the heightened impact of recent attacks on both corporate and government operations, we must begin to hold software companies accountable for such vulnerabilities. Fortunately, there is a lot a company can do to secure its code, should it choose to. After Microsoft's software vulnerabilities drew significant negative attention -- one of the few times the public has correctly affixed blame to a software company -- Bill Gates himself addressed the issue in 2002 in his now famous ''Trustworthy Computing'' memo. In that memo, sent to all Microsoft employees, Mr. Gates made it clear that the company's future depended on building software and a platform that could be reliably secure. It was more than talk: in the decade or so since, Microsoft fundamentally changed its software development process to make security a core part of the program. Too many other companies, though, seem to have missed the memo. Take Oracle, and specifically the security challenges surrounding its Java software, which the company inherited through its 2010 acquisition of Sun Microsystems. Java, one of the most ubiquitous pieces of software in the world, is so full of security holes -- including multiple avenues for hackers to take control of a computer remotely -- that the Department of Homeland Security recommends that its users completely disable the software in their browsers. Oracle is not alone. Adobe, which makes the popular Adobe Reader and Flash applications, has seen a significant number of security weaknesses over the years and also a sharp increase in its software's being a gateway for cyberattacks. The risks associated with Flash were one reason Apple decided not to allow it on iPhones. Like Microsoft, Adobe has made strides to increase the security of its technology over the last couple of years, and more recently some of those security improvements seem to be paying off. But it still has work to do. In his 2002 memo, Mr. Gates cast the security challenge as not just a Microsoft problem, but one for the overall industry. A computer or a network is only as secure as its weakest link -- no matter how secure one program might be, a poorly protected bit of software could compromise everything. That means that on top of investing in their own security, companies have to make efforts to coordinate with other developers to present a united front. Adobe and Microsoft have worked together in recent years to identify and close off mutual vulnerabilities, and other companies should follow suit. A lot of the talk around cybersecurity has centered on the role of government. But investing in software security and cooperating across the software industry shouldn't take an act of Congress. It will, however, take a new mind-set on the part of developers. They should no longer see security as an add-on feature, nor should they regard holes in their competitors' security efforts as merely a competitive advantage. As the world comes to depend more and more on their products, it should demand nothing less. "
Critical Infrastructure Systems Seen as Vulnerable to Attack,"The vast majority of targeted computer attacks now start with a malicious e-mail sent to a company employee. Now evidence suggests that the same technique could be used to attack watersheds, power grids, oil refineries and nuclear plants.  Attackers increasingly use so-called spearphishing attacks, in which they send employees targeted e-mails - often from an e-mail address that matches the name of a colleague, supervisor or chief executive-that contains malicious code. One click is all it takes for an attacker to steal an employee's administrative passwords, turn their machine into a recording device, and see everything they do.  Night Dragon, a series of computer attacks that hit oil, gas and chemical companies in the United States two years ago, used  spearphishing. So did Shady Rat, another extensive digital espionage campaign discovered in 2011 that went after 70 government agencies, corporations and nonprofits in 14 countries. Spearphishing is so easy to deploy and effective that 91 percent of targeted attacks start with malicious e-mails, according to TrendMicro, a computer security firm with headquarters in Tokyo. But that same method could be used to harm utilities, power plants, gas pipelines and watersheds. In a presentation at the S4 computer security conference in Miami on Thursday, Tyler Klingler, a security researcher at Critical Intelligence, an open-source intelligence firm, demonstrated just how susceptible these systems are to spearphishing attacks. Using Jigsaw, a Salesforce service that crowdsources contact information for sales teams, Mr. Klingler dug up the e-mail addresses for control room supervisors at power plants and the engineers that perform maintenance on oil pipelines. He was able to confirm those e-mail addresses using LinkedIn, and also see their contacts and those that had ""endorsed"" their work through the service.  Using that information, his team sent several targeted e-mails, ostensibly from colleagues and contacts, regarding job opportunities or software training for Wonderware and Totalflow, software used in industrial control systems.  Mr. Klingler described the e-mails as ""the trickle coming out of the dam before it breaks."" The hit rate was enough to make you shudder: Some 26 percent of employees who work closely with industrial control systems fell victim to the attack. Mr. Klingler did not disclose the names of the victims, but among their job titles were: a control room supervisor, a pipeline controller, an automation technician, a process controls engineer and a senior vice president for  operations and maintenance.  The sample size of the study was not  large - at one company of more than 300 people, Mr. Klingler's team identified 23 employees who worked with industrial control systems;  seven clicked the link. At another company with roughly 200 employees, they identified 49 employees who worked with critical systems. Eleven clicked the link.  But all it takes is one click for an attacker to get inside a system. In one case, Critical Intelligence could see an instant messaging exchange between two employees that discussed critical systems. And while it would be difficult for attackers to inflict catastrophic damage from one employee's machine, a patient attacker would simply wait for that employee to connect his or her  laptop to an electrical substation, or move around the network to an employee who connected to critical systems regularly.  ""These are the people that have 24-7 access,"" to control rooms, said Dale Peterson, the chief executive of Digital Bond, the security firm that presents the annual S4 conference. ""This is about as real as it gets."" An earlier version of this blog post misspelled the surname of a security researcher at Critical Intelligence. It is Tyler Klingler, not Klinger.  "
Daily Report: Online Attacks on European Diplomats Are Tied to China,"Computer breaches at the foreign ministries of the Czech Republic, Portugal, Bulgaria, Latvia and Hungary have been traced to Chinese hackers, Nicole Perlroth reports.  The attacks, which began in 2010, are continuing, according to a report to be released on Tuesday by FireEye, a computer security company in Milpitas, Calif. Though researchers do not name the hackers' targets in the report, The New York Times identified the foreign ministries through email addresses listed on the attackers' web page. A person with knowledge of the investigation, who was not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed that the foreign ministries of the five countries had been breached. Even as revelations by Edward J. Snowden about surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency and its intelligence partners dominate attention, the FireEye report is a reminder that Chinese hackers continue to break into the computer systems of governments and firms using simple, email-based attacks.

A Fuzzy Line Separates Hacker and Criminal,"In January 2011, I was assigned to cover a hearing in Newark, where Daniel Spitler, then 26, stood accused of breaching AT&T's servers and stealing 114,000 e-mail addresses. Mr. Spitler stood nervously next to armed United States marshals while listening to the judge and prosecutors. I couldn't help thinking that I could have been the one in front of that judge, labeled a hacker by the Justice Department. Am I a hacker? No. Not even close. Yet years ago, when I first started learning how to write software code, I dabbled in things that could have been labeled as such by our outdated justice system: downloading free online scripts that could trace people's whereabouts or scraping Web sites in search of music that didn't belong to me.  A hacker can be a vandal who renders a Web site inoperable or a thief who profits from stolen passwords and credit card numbers. Mr. Spitler was neither kind. But he was being paraded in front of the world, charged with fraud and conspiracy, and likened, by Paul J. Fishman, the United States attorney for New Jersey, to hackers from LulzSec and Anonymous. Mr. Spitler told prosecutors that he had tried to notify AT&T about the security hole on its site, but after the company did not respond, the e-mail addresses were given to Gawker and other media outlets. He said he did not sell them, or post them online. ""Forty years ago, a hacker was someone who took great joy in knowing everything about computers,"" said Susan P. Crawford, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University. ""The word was really used in admiration. Now it is used to describe and condemn both professional cyberattackers and amateurs who are swept together within the broad description of the word."" The same label of hacker was also applied by the Justice Department to Aaron Swartz. Mr. Swartz, a 26-year-old entrepreneur and activist, was set to be charged with wire fraud and computer fraud after he downloaded 4.8 million articles and documents from Jstor, a subscription-only service for distributing scientific and literary journals, because he felt that information should be available to everyone at no cost. Mr. Swartz could have faced up to 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines, but before the case went to trial, he hanged himself in his Brooklyn apartment. His family issued a statement saying that his death ""is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach."" The United States attorney who was overseeing the case, Carmen Ortiz, said her office's ""conduct was appropriate in bringing and handling this case."" Both cases are perfect examples of the justice system's misunderstanding of what a hacker actually is. To many people who understand computers and the law, there is a danger in lumping people who have not sought financial gain with armed robbers. Where people should receive slaps on the wrist, they face decades in prison. ""There's still uncertainty as to what should be criminal online, and the statutes are pretty vague,"" said Orin S. Kerr, a professor of law at George Washington University. ""It's hard because you've got conduct that looks bad, and maybe leads to some harm, coupled with vague laws that haven't properly been clarified by Congress."" The lack of clarity is something that became all too apparent in Mr. Spitler's case. When asked by prosecutors why he had hacked the servers, he said he didn't think he was doing anything illegal. When asked why, he replied, "" 'cause I didn't hack anything."" E-mail:bilton@nytimes.com This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Broad Powers Seen for Obama in Cyberstrikes,"WASHINGTON -- A secret legal review on the use of America's growing arsenal of cyberweapons has concluded that President Obama has the broad power to order a pre-emptive strike if the United States detects credible evidence of a major digital attack looming from abroad, according to officials involved in the review. That decision is among several reached in recent months as the administration moves, in the next few weeks, to approve the nation's first rules for how the military can defend, or retaliate, against a major cyberattack. New policies will also govern how the intelligence agencies can carry out searches of faraway computer networks for signs of potential attacks on the United States and, if the president approves, attack adversaries by injecting them with destructive code -- even if there is no declared war. The rules will be highly classified, just as those governing drone strikes have been closely held. John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser and his nominee to run the Central Intelligence Agency, played a central role in developing the administration's policies regarding both drones and cyberwarfare, the two newest and most politically sensitive weapons in the American arsenal.  Cyberweaponry is the newest and perhaps most complex arms race under way. The Pentagon has created a new Cyber Command, and computer network warfare is one of the few parts of the military budget that is expected to grow. Officials said that the new cyberpolicies had been guided by a decade of evolution in counterterrorism policy, particularly on the division of authority between the military and the intelligence agencies in deploying cyberweapons. Officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk on the record. Under current rules, the military can openly carry out counterterrorism missions in nations where the United States operates under the rules of war, like Afghanistan. But the intelligence agencies have the authority to carry out clandestine drone strikes and commando raids in places like Pakistan and Yemen, which are not declared war zones. The results have provoked wide protests. Mr. Obama is known to have approved the use of cyberweapons only once, early in his presidency, when he ordered an escalating series of cyberattacks against Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. The operation was code-named Olympic Games, and while it began inside the Pentagon under President George W. Bush, it was quickly taken over by the National Security Agency, the largest of the intelligence agencies, under the president's authority to conduct covert action. As the process of defining the rules of engagement began more than a year ago, one senior administration official emphasized that the United States had restrained its use of cyberweapons. ''There are levels of cyberwarfare that are far more aggressive than anything that has been used or recommended to be done,'' the official said. The attacks on Iran illustrated that a nation's infrastructure can be destroyed without bombing it or sending in saboteurs. While many potential targets are military, a country's power grids, financial systems and communications networks can also be crippled. Even more complex, nonstate actors, like terrorists or criminal groups, can mount attacks, and it is often difficult to tell who is responsible. Some critics have said the cyberthreat is being exaggerated by contractors and consultants who see billions in potential earnings. One senior American official said that officials quickly determined that the cyberweapons were so powerful that -- like nuclear weapons -- they should be unleashed only on the direct orders of the commander in chief. A possible exception would be in cases of narrowly targeted tactical strikes by the military, like turning off an air defense system during a conventional strike against an adversary. ''There are very, very few instances in cyberoperations in which the decision will be made at a level below the president,'' the official said. That means the administration has ruled out the use of ''automatic'' retaliation if a cyberattack on America's infrastructure is detected, even if the virus is traveling at network speeds. While the rules have been in development for more than two years, they are coming out at a time of greatly increased cyberattacks on American companies and critical infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security recently announced that an American power station, which it did not name, was crippled for weeks by cyberattacks. The New York Times reported last week that it had been struck, for more than four months, by a cyberattack emanating from China. The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post have reported similar attacks on their systems. ''While this is all described in neutral terms -- what are we going to do about cyberattacks -- the underlying question is, 'What are we going to do about China?' '' said Richard Falkenrath, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''There's a lot of signaling going on between the two countries on this subject.'' International law allows any nation to defend itself from threats, and the United States has applied that concept to conduct pre-emptive attacks. Pre-emption always has been a disputed legal concept. Most recently former Mr. Bush made it a central justification for the invasion of Iraq in 2003, based on faulty intelligence about that country's weapons of mass destruction. Pre-emption in the context of cyberwar raises a potentially bigger quandary, because a country hit by a pre-emptive cyberstrike could easily claim that it was innocent, undermining the justification for the attack. ''It would be very hard to provide evidence to the world that you hit some deadly dangerous computer code,'' one senior official said. The implications of pre-emption in cyberwar were specifically analyzed at length in writing the new rules. One major issue involved in the administration's review, according to one official involved, was defining ''what constitutes reasonable and proportionate force'' in halting or retaliating against a cyberattack. During the attacks on Iran's facilities, which the United States never acknowledged, Mr. Obama insisted that cyberweapons be targeted narrowly, so that they did not affect hospitals or power supplies. Mr. Obama frequently voiced concerns that America's use of cyberweapons could be used by others as justification for attacks on the United States. The American effort was exposed when the cyberweapon leaked out of the Iranian enrichment center that was attacked, and the ''Stuxnet'' code replicated millions of times on the Internet. Under the new guidelines, the Pentagon would not be involved in defending against ordinary cyberattacks on American companies or individuals, even though it has the largest array of cybertools. Domestically, that responsibility falls to the Department of Homeland Security, and investigations of cyberattacks or theft are carried out by the F.B.I. But the military, barred from actions within the United States without a presidential order, would become involved in cases of a major cyberattack within the United States. To maintain ambiguity in an adversary's mind, officials have kept secret what that threshold would be; so far, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta has only described the ''red line'' in the vaguest of terms -- as a ''cyber 9/11.'' The Obama administration has urged stronger firewalls and other systems to provide a first line of defense, and then ''resiliency'' in the face of cyberattacks. It failed to get Congress to pass cybersecurity legislation that would have allowed the government to mandate standards. "
China's Army Seen as Tied To Hacking Against U.S.,"On the outskirts of Shanghai, in a run-down neighborhood dominated by a 12-story white office tower, sits a People's Liberation Army base for China's growing corps of cyberwarriors. The building off Datong Road, surrounded by restaurants, massage parlors and a wine importer, is the headquarters of P.L.A. Unit 61398. A growing body of digital forensic evidence -- confirmed by American intelligence officials who say they have tapped into the activity of the army unit for years -- leaves little doubt that an overwhelming percentage of the attacks on American corporations, organizations and government agencies originate in and around the white tower. An unusually detailed 60-page study, to be released Tuesday by Mandiant, an American computer security firm, tracks for the first time individual members of the most sophisticated of the Chinese hacking groups -- known to many of its victims in the United States as ''Comment Crew'' or ''Shanghai Group'' -- to the doorstep of the military unit's headquarters. The firm was not able to place the hackers inside the 12-story building, but makes a case there is no other plausible explanation for why so many attacks come out of one comparatively small area.  ''Either they are coming from inside Unit 61398,'' said Kevin Mandia, the founder and chief executive of Mandiant, in an interview last week, ''or the people who run the most-controlled, most-monitored Internet networks in the world are clueless about thousands of people generating attacks from this one neighborhood.'' Other security firms that have tracked ''Comment Crew'' say they also believe the group is state-sponsored, and a recent classified National Intelligence Estimate, issued as a consensus document for all 16 of the United States intelligence agencies, makes a strong case that many of these hacking groups are either run by army officers or are contractors working for commands like Unit 61398, according to officials with knowledge of its classified content. Mandiant provided an advance copy of its report to The New York Times, saying it hoped to ''bring visibility to the issues addressed in the report.'' Times reporters then tested the conclusions with other experts, both inside and outside government, who have examined links between the hacking groups and the army (Mandiant was hired by The New York Times Company to investigate a sophisticated Chinese-origin attack on its news operations, but concluded it was not the work of Comment Crew, but another Chinese group. The firm is not currently working for the Times Company but it is in discussions about a business relationship.) While Comment Crew has drained terabytes of data from companies like Coca-Cola, increasingly its focus is on companies involved in the critical infrastructure of the United States -- its electrical power grid, gas lines and waterworks. According to the security researchers, one target was a company with remote access to more than 60 percent of oil and gas pipelines in North America. The unit was also among those that attacked the computer security firm RSA, whose computer codes protect confidential corporate and government databases. Contacted Monday, officials at the Chinese embassy in Washington again insisted that their government does not engage in computer hacking, and that such activity is illegal. They describe China itself as a victim of computer hacking, and point out, accurately, that there are many hacking groups inside the United States. But in recent years the Chinese attacks have grown significantly, security researchers say. Mandiant has detected more than 140 Comment Crew intrusions since 2006. American intelligence agencies and private security firms that track many of the 20 or so other Chinese groups every day say those groups appear to be contractors with links to the unit. While the unit's existence and operations are considered a Chinese state secret, Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview that the Mandiant report was ''completely consistent with the type of activity the Intelligence Committee has been seeing for some time.'' The White House said it was ''aware'' of the Mandiant report, and Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said, ''We have repeatedly raised our concerns at the highest levels about cybertheft with senior Chinese officials, including in the military, and we will continue to do so.'' The United States government is planning to begin a more aggressive defense against Chinese hacking groups, starting on Tuesday. Under a directive signed by President Obama last week, the government plans to share with American Internet providers information it has gathered about the unique digital signatures of the largest of the groups, including Comment Crew and others emanating from near where Unit 61398 is based. But the government warnings will not explicitly link those groups, or the giant computer servers they use, to the Chinese army. The question of whether to publicly name the unit and accuse it of widespread theft is the subject of ongoing debate. ''There are huge diplomatic sensitivities here,'' said one intelligence official, with frustration in his voice. But Obama administration officials say they are planning to tell China's new leaders in coming weeks that the volume and sophistication of the attacks have become so intense that they threaten the fundamental relationship between Washington and Beijing. The United States government also has cyberwarriors. Working with Israel, the United States has used malicious software called Stuxnet to disrupt Iran's uranium enrichment program. But government officials insist they operate under strict, if classified, rules that bar using offensive weapons for nonmilitary purposes or stealing corporate data. The United States finds itself in something of an asymmetrical digital war with China. ''In the cold war, we were focused every day on the nuclear command centers around Moscow,'' one senior defense official said recently. ''Today, it's fair to say that we worry as much about the computer servers in Shanghai.'' A Shadowy Unit Unit 61398 -- formally, the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army's General Staff Department's 3rd Department -- exists almost nowhere in official Chinese military descriptions. Yet intelligence analysts who have studied the group say it is the central element of Chinese computer espionage. The unit was described in 2011 as the ''premier entity targeting the United States and Canada, most likely focusing on political, economic, and military-related intelligence'' by the Project 2049 Institute, a nongovernmental organization in Virginia that studies security and policy issues in Asia. While the Obama administration has never publicly discussed the Chinese unit's activities, a secret State Department cable written the day before Barack Obama was elected president in November 2008 described at length American concerns about the group's attacks on government sites. (At the time American intelligence agencies called the unit ''Byzantine Candor,'' a code word dropped after the cable was published by WikiLeaks.) The Defense Department and the State Department were particular targets, the cable said, describing how the group's intruders send e-mails, called ''spearphishing'' attacks, that placed malware on target computers once the recipient clicked on them. From there, they were inside the systems. American officials say that a combination of diplomatic concerns and the desire to follow the unit's activities have kept the government from going public. But Mandiant's report is forcing the issue into public view. For more than six years, Mandiant tracked the actions of Comment Crew, so named for the attackers' penchant for embedding hidden code or comments into Web pages. Based on the digital crumbs the group left behind -- its attackers have been known to use the same malware, Web domains, Internet protocol addresses, hacking tools and techniques across attacks -- Mandiant followed 141 attacks by the group, which it called ''A.P.T. 1'' for Advanced Persistent Threat 1. ''But those are only the ones we could easily identify,'' said Mr. Mandia. Other security experts estimate that the group is responsible for thousands of attacks. As Mandiant mapped the Internet protocol addresses and other bits of digital evidence, it all led back to the edges of Pudong district of Shanghai, right around the Unit 61398 headquarters. The group's report, along with 3,000 addresses and other indicators that can be used to identify the source of attacks, concludes ''the totality of the evidence'' leads to the conclusion that ''A.P.T. 1 is Unit 61398.'' Mandiant discovered that two sets of I.P. addresses used in the attacks were registered in the same neighborhood as Unit 61398's building. ''It's where more than 90 percent of the attacks we followed come from,'' said Mr. Mandia. The only other possibility, the report concludes with a touch of sarcasm, is that ''a secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multiyear enterprise-scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398's gates.'' The most fascinating elements of the Mandiant report follow the keystroke-by-keystroke actions of several of the hackers who the firm believes work for the P.L.A. Mandiant tracked their activities from inside the computer systems of American companies they were invading. The companies had given Mandiant investigators full access to rid them of the Chinese spies. One of the most visible hackers it followed is UglyGorilla, who first appeared on a Chinese military forum in January 2004, asking whether China has a ''similar force'' to the ''cyber army'' being set up by the American military. By 2007 UglyGorilla was turning out a suite of malware with what the report called a ''clearly identifiable signature.'' Another hacker, called ''DOTA'' by Mandiant, created e-mail accounts that were used to plant malware. That hacker was tracked frequently using a password that appeared to be based on his military unit's designation. DOTA and UglyGorilla both used the same I.P. addresses linked back to Unit 61398's neighborhood. Mandiant discovered several cases in which attackers logged into their Facebook and Twitter accounts to get around China's firewall that blocks ordinary citizen's access, making it easier to track down their real identities. Mandiant also discovered an internal China Telecom memo discussing the state-owned telecom company's decision to install high-speed fiber-optic lines for Unit 61398's headquarters. China's defense ministry has denied that it is responsible for initiating attacks. ''It is unprofessional and groundless to accuse the Chinese military of launching cyberattacks without any conclusive evidence,'' it said last month, one of the statements that prompted Mandiant to make public its evidence. Escalating Attacks Mandiant believes Unit 61398 conducted sporadic attacks on American corporate and government computer networks; the earliest it found was in 2006. Two years ago the numbers spiked. Mandiant discovered some of the intrusions were long-running. On average the group would stay inside a network, stealing data and passwords, for a year; in one case it had access for four years and 10 months. Mandiant has watched the group as it has stolen technology blueprints, manufacturing processes, clinical trial results, pricing documents, negotiation strategies and other proprietary information from more than 100 of its clients, mostly in the United States. Mandiant identified attacks on 20 industries, from military contractors to chemical plants, mining companies and satellite and telecommunications corporations. Mandiant's report does not name the victims, who usually insist on anonymity. A 2009 attack on Coca-Cola coincided with the beverage giant's failed attempt to acquire the China Huiyuan Juice Group for $2.4 billion, according to people with knowledge of the results of the company's investigation. As Coca-Cola executives were negotiating what would have been the largest foreign purchase of a Chinese company, Comment Crew was busy rummaging through their computers in an apparent effort to learn more about Coca-Cola's negotiation strategy. The attack on Coca-Cola began, like hundreds before it, with a seemingly innocuous e-mail to an executive that was, in fact, a spearphishing attack. When the executive clicked on a malicious link in the e-mail, it gave the attackers a foothold inside Coca-Cola's network. From inside, they sent confidential company files through a maze of computers back to Shanghai, on a weekly basis, unnoticed. Two years later, Comment Crew was one of at least three Chinese-based groups to mount a similar attack on RSA, the computer security company owned by EMC, a large technology company. It is best known for its SecurID token, carried by employees at United States intelligence agencies, military contractors and many major companies. (The New York Times also uses the firm's tokens to allow access to its e-mail and production systems remotely.) RSA has offered to replace SecurID tokens for customers and said it had added new layers of security to its products. As in the Coca-Cola case, the attack began with a targeted, cleverly fashioned poisoned e-mail to an RSA employee. Two months later, hackers breached Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest defense contractor, partly by using the information they gleaned from the RSA attack. Mandiant is not the only private firm tracking Comment Crew. In 2011, Joe Stewart, a Dell SecureWorks researcher, was analyzing malware used in the RSA attack when he discovered that the attackers had used a hacker tool to mask their true location. When he reverse-engineered the tool, he found that the vast majority of stolen data had been transferred to the same range of I.P. addresses that Mandiant later identified in Shanghai. Dell SecureWorks says it believed Comment Crew includes the same group of attackers behind Operation Shady RAT, an extensive computer espionage campaign uncovered in 2011 in which more than 70 organizations over a five-year period, including the United Nations, government agencies in the United States, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam were targeted. Infrastructure at Risk What most worries American investigators is that the latest set of attacks believed coming from Unit 61398 focus not just on stealing information, but obtaining the ability to manipulate American critical infrastructure: the power grids and other utilities. Staff at Digital Bond, a small security firm that specializes in those industrial-control computers, said that last June Comment Crew unsuccessfully attacked it. A part-time employee at Digital Bond received an e-mail that appeared to come from his boss, Dale Peterson. The e-mail, in perfect English, discussed security weaknesses in critical infrastructure systems, and asked the employee to click a link to a document for more information. Mr. Peterson caught the e-mail and shared it with other researchers, who found the link contained a remote-access tool that would have given the attackers control over the employee's computer and potentially given them a front-row seat to confidential information about Digital Bond's clients, which include a major water project, a power plant and a mining company. Jaime Blasco, a security researcher at AlienVault, analyzed the computer servers used in the attack, which led him to other victims, including the Chertoff Group. That firm, headed by the former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, has run simulations of an extensive digital attack on the United States. Other attacks were made on a contractor for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, a lobbying group that represents companies that make components for power grids. Those organizations confirmed they were attacked but have said they prevented attackers from gaining access to their network. Mr. Blasco said that, based on the forensics, all the victims had been hit by Comment Crew. But the most troubling attack to date, security experts say, was a successful invasion of the Canadian arm of Telvent. The company, now owned by Schneider Electric, designs software that gives oil and gas pipeline companies and power grid operators remote access to valves, switches and security systems. Telvent keeps detailed blueprints on more than half of all the oil and gas pipelines in North and South America, and has access to their systems. In September, Telvent Canada told customers that attackers had broken into its systems and taken project files. That access was immediately cut, so that the intruders could not take command of the systems. Martin Hanna, a Schneider Electric spokesman, did not return requests for comment, but security researchers who studied the malware used in the attack, including Mr. Stewart at Dell SecureWorks and Mr. Blasco at AlienVault, confirmed that the perpetrators were the Comment Crew. ''This is terrifying because -- forget about the country -- if someone hired me and told me they wanted to have the offensive capability to take out as many critical systems as possible, I would be going after the vendors and do things like what happened to Telvent,'' Mr. Peterson of Digital Bond said. ''It's the holy grail.'' Mr. Obama alluded to this concern in the State of the Union speech, without mentioning China or any other nation. ''We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets,'' he said. ''Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air-traffic control systems. We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing.'' Mr. Obama faces a vexing choice: In a sprawling, vital relationship with China, is it worth a major confrontation between the world's largest and second largest economy over computer hacking? A few years ago, administration officials say, the theft of intellectual property was an annoyance, resulting in the loss of billions of dollars of revenue. But clearly something has changed. The mounting evidence of state sponsorship, the increasing boldness of Unit 61398, and the growing threat to American infrastructure are leading officials to conclude that a far stronger response is necessary. ''Right now there is no incentive for the Chinese to stop doing this,'' said Mr. Rogers, the House intelligence chairman. ''If we don't create a high price, it's only going to keep accelerating.'' "
Daily Report: Broad Powers Seen for Obama in Cyberstrike,"A secret legal review on the use of America's growing arsenal of cyberweapons has concluded that President Obama has the broad power to order a pre-emptive strike if the United States detects credible evidence of a major digital attack looming from abroad, according to officials involved in the review, report David E. Sanger and Thom Shanker in Monday's New York Times.  That decision is among several reached in recent months as the administration moves, in the next few weeks, to approve the nation's first rules for how the military can defend, or retaliate, against a major cyberattack. New policies will also govern how the intelligence agencies can carry out searches of faraway computer networks for signs of potential attacks on the United States and, if the president approves, attack adversaries by injecting them with destructive code - even if there is no declared war. The rules will be highly classified, just as those governing drone strikes have been closely held. John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser and his nominee to run the Central Intelligence Agency, played a central role in developing the administration's policies regarding both drones and cyberwarfare, the two newest and most politically sensitive weapons in the American arsenal. Cyberweaponry is the newest and perhaps most complex arms race under way among large and small powers. The Pentagon has created a new Cyber Command, and computer network warfare is one of the few parts of the military budget that is expected to grow despite looming spending cuts. Officials said that the new cyberpolicies had been guided by a decade of evolution in counterterrorism policy, particularly on the division of authority between the military and the intelligence agencies in deploying cyberweapons. Officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk on the record.  "
Accusations of Chinese Hacking in Coke's Failed Big Deal,"A new report on Chinese hackers depicts a wide-ranging cyberwar campaign against an array of American targets, from computer security providers to power plant suppliers. But according to The New York Times, a big deal by the Coca-Cola Company that ultimately failed was also in the sights of the Chinese army's hacker corps.  In 2008, Coca-Cola bid about $2.4 billion for the China Huiyuan Juice Group, a beverage company based in Beijing, in what would have been one of the biggest foreign acquisitions ever in that country. Six months later, Chinese regulators blocked the proposed transaction on antitrust grounds, contending that it would have given a foreign company too much power over the domestic juice market. While China Huiyuan's investors largely supported the deal, the transaction raised nationalist hackles within the general public. But something else may have been at work. From Monday's article in The Times: As Coca-Cola executives were negotiating what would have been the largest foreign purchase of a Chinese company, Comment Crew was busy rummaging through their computers in an apparent effort to learn more about Coca-Cola's negotiation strategy. The attack on Coca-Cola began, like hundreds before it, with a seemingly innocuous e-mail to an executive that was, in fact, a spearphishing attack. When the executive clicked on a malicious link in the e-mail, it gave the attackers a foothold inside Coca-Cola's network. From inside, they sent confidential company files through a maze of computers back to Shanghai, on a weekly basis, unnoticed. An earlier version of this article misspelled a company name. It is China Huiyuan Juice Group, not Huiyan.  "

"Problems at Health Care Web Site Not From Online Attack, Experts Say","As the federal government struggled on Wednesday to explain the technical problems experienced by would-be users of the health exchange Web site, www.healthcare.gov, computer security specialists say they had ruled out a cyberattack known as a denial of service, or DDoS, attack. Those occur when attackers fire huge amounts of traffic at a Web site until it collapses under the load.  Such attacks typically entail hundreds of millions of data requests to a site per second. The federal health care site experienced 4.7 million unique visitors in the first 24 hours. New York State's site experienced 30 million Web requests, which could have been fueled at least in part by a New York advertising blitz on sites like CNN.com, media coverage, and links from news sharing sites like Reddit. By comparison, Connecticut reported just under 80,000 Web site visits by the end of Tuesday. The more likely source of the problems, security specialists say, was growing pains. Some questioned whether the government had enough database resources to accommodate the huge spike in first- and second-day Web site traffic from insurance shoppers. Federal officials have yet to respond to questions about the problems. Planning for that kind of capacity can be tricky, experts say, because if the government spends vast amounts of resources accommodating first-day traffic, its databases could sit idle a week later. If the government underinvests, computer specialists say, they could encounter the problems that cropped up Monday. ""It's a cost-benefit trade-off,"" said Matthew Prince, the founder of Cloudflare, a San Francisco start-up that distributes vast amounts of Web traffic across the Internet. ""At the end of the day, you can solve these problems by throwing more money at them. In this case, they could have built an entire data center to accommodate first- and second-day traffic, but at some point, it would have sat empty."" Both the federal and New York State health exchanges rely on Akamai, which helps distribute Web traffic across the Internet, and was able to keep the Web sites online even as millions flocked to them.   The real issue, security experts said, was not that users couldn't access the site, but that databases could not keep up with the influx of requests. When users tried to register their accounts, they would encounter annoying error messages, such as one many users encountered informing them that the answers to their security questions were not sufficient.  Services like Cloudflare, Akamai and Amazon Web Services help spread traffic from one site to Web servers all over the world, so that an unexpected peak in traffic does not bring down a site. But scaling databases, where a company's actual data is stored, can be much harder.  ""These are systems that have finite resources,"" Mr. Prince said. ""If too many requests go to them, they stop working.""  New York State officials said on Tuesday that they were doubling capacity to address application processing delays.  "
Snowden's People,"This past January, Laura Poitras received a curious e-mail from an anonymous stranger requesting her public encryption key. For almost two years, Poitras had been working on a documentary about surveillance, and she occasionally received queries from strangers. She replied to this one and sent her public key -- allowing him or her to send an encrypted e-mail that only Poitras could open, with her private key -- but she didn't think much would come of it. The stranger responded with instructions for creating an even more secure system to protect their exchanges. Promising sensitive information, the stranger told Poitras to select long pass phrases that could withstand a brute-force attack by networked computers. ''Assume that your adversary is capable of a trillion guesses per second,'' the stranger wrote. Before long, Poitras received an encrypted message that outlined a number of secret surveillance programs run by the government. She had heard of one of them but not the others. After describing each program, the stranger wrote some version of the phrase, ''This I can prove.''  Seconds after she decrypted and read the e-mail, Poitras disconnected from the Internet and removed the message from her computer. ''I thought, O.K., if this is true, my life just changed,'' she told me last month. ''It was staggering, what he claimed to know and be able to provide. I just knew that I had to change everything.'' Poitras remained wary of whoever it was she was communicating with. She worried especially that a government agent might be trying to trick her into disclosing information about the people she interviewed for her documentary, including Julian Assange, the editor of WikiLeaks. ''I called him out,'' Poitras recalled. ''I said either you have this information and you are taking huge risks or you are trying to entrap me and the people I know, or you're crazy.'' The answers were reassuring but not definitive. Poitras did not know the stranger's name, sex, age or employer (C.I.A.? N.S.A.? Pentagon?). In early June, she finally got the answers. Along with her reporting partner, Glenn Greenwald, a former lawyer and a columnist for The Guardian, Poitras flew to Hong Kong and met the N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden, who gave them thousands of classified documents, setting off a major controversy over the extent and legality of government surveillance. Poitras was right that, among other things, her life would never be the same. Greenwald lives and works in a house surrounded by tropical foliage in a remote area of Rio de Janeiro. He shares the home with his Brazilian partner and their 10 dogs and one cat, and the place has the feel of a low-key fraternity that has been dropped down in the jungle. The kitchen clock is off by hours, but no one notices; dishes tend to pile up in the sink; the living room contains a table and a couch and a large TV, an Xbox console and a box of poker chips and not much else. The refrigerator is not always filled with fresh vegetables. A family of monkeys occasionally raids the banana trees in the backyard and engages in shrieking battles with the dogs. Greenwald does most of his work on a shaded porch, usually dressed in a T-shirt, surfer shorts and flip-flops. Over the four days I spent there, he was in perpetual motion, speaking on the phone in Portuguese and English, rushing out the door to be interviewed in the city below, answering calls and e-mails from people seeking information about Snowden, tweeting to his 225,000 followers (and conducting intense arguments with a number of them), then sitting down to write more N.S.A. articles for The Guardian, all while pleading with his dogs to stay quiet. During one especially fever-pitched moment, he hollered, ''Shut up, everyone,'' but they didn't seem to care. Amid the chaos, Poitras, an intense-looking woman of 49, sat in a spare bedroom or at the table in the living room, working in concentrated silence in front of her multiple computers. Once in a while she would walk over to the porch to talk with Greenwald about the article he was working on, or he would sometimes stop what he was doing to look at the latest version of a new video she was editing about Snowden. They would talk intensely -- Greenwald far louder and more rapid-fire than Poitras -- and occasionally break out laughing at some shared joke or absurd memory. The Snowden story, they both said, was a battle they were waging together, a fight against powers of surveillance that they both believe are a threat to fundamental American liberties. Two reporters for The Guardian were in town to assist Greenwald, so some of our time was spent in the hotel where they were staying along Copacabana Beach, the toned Brazilians playing volleyball in the sand below lending the whole thing an added layer of surreality. Poitras has shared the byline on some of Greenwald's articles, but for the most part she has preferred to stay in the background, letting him do the writing and talking. As a result, Greenwald is the one hailed as either a fearless defender of individual rights or a nefarious traitor, depending on your perspective. ''I keep calling her the Keyser Soze of the story, because she's at once completely invisible and yet ubiquitous,'' Greenwald said, referring to the character in ''The Usual Suspects'' played by Kevin Spacey, a mastermind masquerading as a nobody. ''She's been at the center of all of this, and yet no one knows anything about her.'' As dusk fell one evening, I followed Poitras and Greenwald to the newsroom of O Globo, one of the largest newspapers in Brazil. Greenwald had just published an article there detailing how the N.S.A. was spying on Brazilian phone calls and e-mails. The article caused a huge scandal in Brazil, as similar articles have done in other countries around the world, and Greenwald was a celebrity in the newsroom. The editor in chief pumped his hand and asked him to write a regular column; reporters took souvenir pictures with their cellphones. Poitras filmed some of this, then put her camera down and looked on. I noted that nobody was paying attention to her, that all eyes were on Greenwald, and she smiled. ''That's right,'' she said. ''That's perfect.'' Poitras seems to work at blending in, a function more of strategy than of shyness. She can actually be remarkably forceful when it comes to managing information. During a conversation in which I began to ask her a few questions about her personal life, she remarked, ''This is like visiting the dentist.'' The thumbnail portrait is this: She was raised in a well-off family outside Boston, and after high school, she moved to San Francisco to work as a chef in upscale restaurants. She also took classes at the San Francisco Art Institute, where she studied under the experimental filmmaker Ernie Gehr. In 1992, she moved to New York and began to make her way in the film world, while also enrolling in graduate classes in social and political theory at the New School. Since then she has made five films, most recently ''The Oath,'' about the Guantánamo prisoner Salim Hamdan and his brother-in-law back in Yemen, and has been the recipient of a Peabody Award and a MacArthur award. On Sept. 11, 2001, Poitras was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan when the towers were attacked. Like most New Yorkers, in the weeks that followed she was swept up in both mourning and a feeling of unity. It was a moment, she said, when ''people could have done anything, in a positive sense.'' When that moment led to the pre-emptive invasion of Iraq, she felt that her country had lost its way. ''We always wonder how countries can veer off course,'' she said. ''How do people let it happen, how do people sit by during this slipping of boundaries?'' Poitras had no experience in conflict zones, but in June 2004, she went to Iraq and began documenting the occupation. Shortly after arriving in Baghdad, she received permission to go to Abu Ghraib prison to film a visit by members of Baghdad's City Council. This was just a few months after photos were published of American soldiers abusing prisoners there. A prominent Sunni doctor was part of the visiting delegation, and Poitras shot a remarkable scene of his interaction with prisoners there, shouting that they were locked up for no good reason. The doctor, Riyadh al-Adhadh, invited Poitras to his clinic and later allowed her to report on his life in Baghdad. Her documentary, ''My Country, My Country,'' is centered on his family's travails -- the shootings and blackouts in their neighborhood, the kidnapping of a nephew. The film premiered in early 2006 and received widespread acclaim, including an Oscar nomination for best documentary. Attempting to tell the story of the war's effect on Iraqi citizens made Poitras the target of serious -- and apparently false -- accusations. On Nov. 19, 2004, Iraqi troops, supported by American forces, raided a mosque in the doctor's neighborhood of Adhamiya, killing several people inside. The next day, the neighborhood erupted in violence. Poitras was with the doctor's family, and occasionally they would go to the roof of the home to get a sense of what was going on. On one of those rooftop visits, she was seen by soldiers from an Oregon National Guard battalion. Shortly after, a group of insurgents launched an attack that killed one of the Americans. Some soldiers speculated that Poitras was on the roof because she had advance notice of the attack and wanted to film it. Their battalion commander, Lt. Col. Daniel Hendrickson, retired, told me last month that he filed a report about her to brigade headquarters. There is no evidence to support this claim. Fighting occurred throughout the neighborhood that day, so it would have been difficult for any journalist to not be near the site of an attack. The soldiers who made the allegation told me that they have no evidence to prove it. Hendrickson told me his brigade headquarters never got back to him. For several months after the attack in Adhamiya, Poitras continued to live in the Green Zone and work as an embedded journalist with the U.S. military. She has screened her film to a number of military audiences, including at the U.S. Army War College. An officer who interacted with Poitras in Baghdad, Maj. Tom Mowle, retired, said Poitras was always filming and it ''completely makes sense'' she would film on a violent day. ''I think it's a pretty ridiculous allegation,'' he said. Although the allegations were without evidence, they may be related to Poitras's many detentions and searches. Hendrickson and another soldier told me that in 2007 -- months after she was first detained -- investigators from the Department of Justice's Joint Terrorism Task Force interviewed them, inquiring about Poitras's activities in Baghdad that day. Poitras was never contacted by those or any other investigators, however. ''Iraq forces and the U.S. military raided a mosque during Friday prayers and killed several people,'' Poitras said. ''Violence broke out the next day. I am a documentary filmmaker and was filming in the neighborhood. Any suggestion I knew about an attack is false. The U.S. government should investigate who ordered the raid, not journalists covering the war.'' In June 2006, her tickets on domestic flights were marked ''SSSS'' -- Secondary Security Screening Selection -- which means the bearer faces extra scrutiny beyond the usual measures. She was detained for the first time at Newark International Airport before boarding a flight to Israel, where she was showing her film. On her return flight, she was held for two hours before being allowed to re-enter the country. The next month, she traveled to Bosnia to show the film at a festival there. When she flew out of Sarajevo and landed in Vienna, she was paged on the airport loudspeaker and told to go to a security desk; from there she was led to a van and driven to another part of the airport, then taken into a room where luggage was examined. ''They took my bags and checked them,'' Poitras said. ''They asked me what I was doing, and I said I was showing a movie in Sarajevo about the Iraq war. And then I sort of befriended the security guy. I asked what was going on. He said: 'You're flagged. You have a threat score that is off the Richter scale. You are at 400 out of 400.' I said, 'Is this a scoring system that works throughout all of Europe, or is this an American scoring system?' He said. 'No, this is your government that has this and has told us to stop you.' '' After 9/11, the U.S. government began compiling a terrorist watch list that was at one point estimated to contain nearly a million names. There are at least two subsidiary lists that relate to air travel. The no-fly list contains the names of tens of thousands of people who are not allowed to fly into or out of the country. The selectee list, which is larger than the no-fly list, subjects people to extra airport inspections and questioning. These lists have been criticized by civil rights groups for being too broad and arbitrary and for violating the rights of Americans who are on them. In Vienna, Poitras was eventually cleared to board her connecting flight to New York, but when she landed at J.F.K., she was met at the gate by two armed law-enforcement agents and taken to a room for questioning. It is a routine that has happened so many times since then -- on more than 40 occasions -- that she has lost precise count. Initially, she said, the authorities were interested in the paper she carried, copying her receipts and, once, her notebook. After she stopped carrying her notes, they focused on her electronics instead, telling her that if she didn't answer their questions, they would confiscate her gear and get their answers that way. On one occasion, Poitras says, they did seize her computers and cellphones and kept them for weeks. She was also told that her refusal to answer questions was itself a suspicious act. Because the interrogations took place at international boarding crossings, where the government contends that ordinary constitutional rights do not apply, she was not permitted to have a lawyer present. ''It's a total violation,'' Poitras said. ''That's how it feels. They are interested in information that pertains to the work I am doing that's clearly private and privileged. It's an intimidating situation when people with guns meet you when you get off an airplane.'' Though she has written to members of Congress and has submitted Freedom of Information Act requests, Poitras has never received any explanation for why she was put on a watch list. ''It's infuriating that I have to speculate why,'' she said. ''When did that universe begin, that people are put on a list and are never told and are stopped for six years? I have no idea why they did it. It's the complete suspension of due process.'' She added: ''I've been told nothing, I've been asked nothing, and I've done nothing. It's like Kafka. Nobody ever tells you what the accusation is.'' After being detained repeatedly, Poitras began taking steps to protect her data, asking a traveling companion to carry her laptop, leaving her notebooks overseas with friends or in safe deposit boxes. She would wipe her computers and cellphones clean so that there would be nothing for the authorities to see. Or she encrypted her data, so that law enforcement could not read any files they might get hold of. These security preparations could take a day or more before her travels. It wasn't just border searches that she had to worry about. Poitras said she felt that if the government was suspicious enough to interrogate her at airports, it was also most likely surveilling her e-mail, phone calls and Web browsing. ''I assume that there are National Security Letters on my e-mails,'' she told me, referring to one of the secretive surveillance tools used by the Department of Justice. A National Security Letter requires its recipients -- in most cases, Internet service providers and phone companies -- to provide customer data without notifying the customers or any other parties. Poitras suspected (but could not confirm, because her phone company and I.S.P. would be prohibited from telling her) that the F.B.I. had issued National Security Letters for her electronic communications. Once she began working on her surveillance film in 2011, she raised her digital security to an even higher level. She cut down her use of a cellphone, which betrays not only who you are calling and when, but your location at any given point in time. She was careful about e-mailing sensitive documents or having sensitive conversations on the phone. She began using software that masked the Web sites she visited. After she was contacted by Snowden in 2013, she tightened her security yet another notch. In addition to encrypting any sensitive e-mails, she began using different computers for editing film, for communicating and for reading sensitive documents (the one for sensitive documents is air-gapped, meaning it has never been connected to the Internet). These precautions might seem paranoid -- Poitras describes them as ''pretty extreme'' -- but the people she has interviewed for her film were targets of the sort of surveillance and seizure that she fears. William Binney, a former top N.S.A. official who publicly accused the agency of illegal surveillance, was at home one morning in 2007 when F.B.I. agents burst in and aimed their weapons at his wife, his son and himself. Binney was, at the moment the agent entered his bathroom and pointed a gun at his head, naked in the shower. His computers, disks and personal records were confiscated and have not yet been returned. Binney has not been charged with any crime. Jacob Appelbaum, a privacy activist who was a volunteer with WikiLeaks, has also been filmed by Poitras. The government issued a secret order to Twitter for access to Appelbaum's account data, which became public when Twitter fought the order. Though the company was forced to hand over the data, it was allowed to tell Appelbaum. Google and a small I.S.P. that Appelbaum used were also served with secret orders and fought to alert him. Like Binney, Appelbaum has not been charged with any crime. Poitras endured the airport searches for years with little public complaint, lest her protests generate more suspicion and hostility from the government, but last year she reached a breaking point. While being interrogated at Newark after a flight from Britain, she was told she could not take notes. On the advice of lawyers, Poitras always recorded the names of border agents and the questions they asked and the material they copied or seized. But at Newark, an agent threatened to handcuff her if she continued writing. She was told that she was being barred from writing anything down because she might use her pen as a weapon. ''Then I asked for crayons,'' Poitras recalled, ''and he said no to crayons.'' She was taken into another room and interrogated by three agents -- one was behind her, another asked the questions, the third was a supervisor. ''It went on for maybe an hour and a half,'' she said. ''I was taking notes of their questions, or trying to, and they yelled at me. I said, 'Show me the law where it says I can't take notes.' We were in a sense debating what they were trying to forbid me from doing. They said, 'We are the ones asking the questions.' It was a pretty aggressive, antagonistic encounter.'' Poitras met Greenwald in 2010, when she became interested in his work on WikiLeaks. In 2011, she went to Rio to film him for her documentary. He was aware of the searches and asked several times for permission to write about them. After Newark, she gave him a green light. ''She said, 'I've had it,' '' Greenwald told me. ''Her ability to take notes and document what was happening was her one sense of agency, to maintain some degree of control. Documenting is what she does. I think she was feeling that the one vestige of security and control in this situation had been taken away from her, without any explanation, just as an arbitrary exercise of power.'' At the time, Greenwald was a writer for Salon. His article, ''U.S. Filmmaker Repeatedly Detained at Border,'' was published in April 2012. Shortly after it was posted, the detentions ceased. Six years of surveillance and harassment, Poitras hoped, might be coming to an end. Poitras was not Snowden's first choice as the person to whom he wanted to leak thousands of N.S.A. documents. In fact, a month before contacting her, he reached out to Greenwald, who had written extensively and critically about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the erosion of civil liberties in the wake of 9/11. Snowden anonymously sent him an e-mail saying he had documents he wanted to share, and followed that up with a step-by-step guide on how to encrypt communications, which Greenwald ignored. Snowden then sent a link to an encryption video, also to no avail. ''It's really annoying and complicated, the encryption software,'' Greenwald said as we sat on his porch during a tropical drizzle. ''He kept harassing me, but at some point he just got frustrated, so he went to Laura.'' Snowden had read Greenwald's article about Poitras's troubles at U.S. airports and knew she was making a film about the government's surveillance programs; he had also seen a short documentary about the N.S.A. that she made for The New York Times Op-Docs. He figured that she would understand the programs he wanted to leak about and would know how to communicate in a secure way. By late winter, Poitras decided that the stranger with whom she was communicating was credible. There were none of the provocations that she would expect from a government agent -- no requests for information about the people she was in touch with, no questions about what she was working on. Snowden told her early on that she would need to work with someone else, and that she should reach out to Greenwald. She was unaware that Snowden had already tried to contact Greenwald, and Greenwald would not realize until he met Snowden in Hong Kong that this was the person who had contacted him more than six months earlier. There were surprises for everyone in these exchanges -- including Snowden, who answered questions that I submitted to him through Poitras. In response to a question about when he realized he could trust Poitras, he wrote: ''We came to a point in the verification and vetting process where I discovered Laura was more suspicious of me than I was of her, and I'm famously paranoid.'' When I asked him about Greenwald's initial silence in response to his requests and instructions for encrypted communications, Snowden replied: ''I know journalists are busy and had assumed being taken seriously would be a challenge, especially given the paucity of detail I could initially offer. At the same time, this is 2013, and [he is] a journalist who regularly reported on the concentration and excess of state power. I was surprised to realize that there were people in news organizations who didn't recognize any unencrypted message sent over the Internet is being delivered to every intelligence service in the world.'' In April, Poitras e-mailed Greenwald to say they needed to speak face to face. Greenwald happened to be in the United States, speaking at a conference in a suburb of New York City, and the two met in the lobby of his hotel. ''She was very cautious,'' Greenwald recalled. ''She insisted that I not take my cellphone, because of this ability the government has to remotely listen to cellphones even when they are turned off. She had printed off the e-mails, and I remember reading the e-mails and felt intuitively that this was real. The passion and thought behind what Snowden -- who we didn't know was Snowden at the time -- was saying was palpable.'' Greenwald installed encryption software and began communicating with the stranger. Their work was organized like an intelligence operation, with Poitras as the mastermind. ''Operational security -- she dictated all of that,'' Greenwald said. ''Which computers I used, how I communicated, how I safeguarded the information, where copies were kept, with whom they were kept, in which places. She has this complete expert level of understanding of how to do a story like this with total technical and operational safety. None of this would have happened with anything near the efficacy and impact it did, had she not been working with me in every sense and really taking the lead in coordinating most of it.'' Snowden began to provide documents to the two of them. Poitras wouldn't tell me when he began sending her documents; she does not want to provide the government with information that could be used in a trial against Snowden or herself. He also said he would soon be ready to meet them. When Poitras asked if she should plan on driving to their meeting or taking a train, Snowden told her to be ready to get on a plane. In May, he sent encrypted messages telling the two of them to go to Hong Kong. Greenwald flew to New York from Rio, and Poitras joined him for meetings with the editor of The Guardian's American edition. With the paper's reputation on the line, the editor asked them to bring along a veteran Guardian reporter, Ewen MacAskill, and on June 1, the trio boarded a 16-hour flight from J.F.K. to Hong Kong. Snowden had sent a small number of documents to Greenwald, about 20 in all, but Poitras had received a larger trove, which she hadn't yet had the opportunity to read closely. On the plane, Greenwald began going through its contents, eventually coming across a secret court order requiring Verizon to give its customer phone records to the N.S.A. The four-page order was from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a panel whose decisions are highly classified. Although it was rumored that the N.S.A. was collecting large numbers of American phone records, the government always denied it. Poitras, sitting 20 rows behind Greenwald, occasionally went forward to talk about what he was reading. As the man sitting next to him slept, Greenwald pointed to the FISA order on his screen and asked Poitras: ''Have you seen this? Is this saying what I'm thinking it's saying?'' At times, they talked so animatedly that they disturbed passengers who were trying to sleep; they quieted down. ''We couldn't believe just how momentous this occasion was,'' Greenwald said. ''When you read these documents, you get a sense of the breadth of them. It was a rush of adrenaline and ecstasy and elation. You feel you are empowered for the first time because there's this mammoth system that you try and undermine and subvert and shine a light on -- but you usually can't make any headway, because you don't have any instruments to do it -- [and now] the instruments were suddenly in our lap.'' Snowden had instructed them that once they were in Hong Kong, they were to go at an appointed time to the Kowloon district and stand outside a restaurant that was in a mall connected to the Mira Hotel. There, they were to wait until they saw a man carrying a Rubik's Cube, then ask him when the restaurant would open. The man would answer their question, but then warn that the food was bad. When the man with the Rubik's Cube arrived, it was Edward Snowden, who was 29 at the time but looked even younger. ''Both of us almost fell over when we saw how young he was,'' Poitras said, still sounding surprised. ''I had no idea. I assumed I was dealing with somebody who was really high-level and therefore older. But I also knew from our back and forth that he was incredibly knowledgeable about computer systems, which put him younger in my mind. So I was thinking like 40s, somebody who really grew up on computers but who had to be at a higher level.'' In our encrypted chat, Snowden also remarked on this moment: ''I think they were annoyed that I was younger than they expected, and I was annoyed that they had arrived too early, which complicated the initial verification. As soon as we were behind closed doors, however, I think everyone was reassured by the obsessive attention to precaution and bona fides.'' They followed Snowden to his room, where Poitras immediately shifted into documentarian mode, taking her camera out. ''It was a little bit tense, a little uncomfortable,'' Greenwald said of those initial minutes. ''We sat down, and we just started chatting, and Laura was immediately unpacking her camera. The instant that she turned on the camera, I very vividly recall that both he and I completely stiffened up.'' Greenwald began the questioning. ''I wanted to test the consistency of his claims, and I just wanted all the information I could get, given how much I knew this was going to be affecting my credibility and everything else. We weren't really able to establish a human bond until after that five or six hours was over.'' For Poitras, the camera certainly alters the human dynamic, but not in a bad way. When someone consents to being filmed -- even if the consent is indirectly gained when she turns on the camera -- this is an act of trust that raises the emotional stakes of the moment. What Greenwald saw as stilted, Poitras saw as a kind of bonding, the sharing of an immense risk. ''There is something really palpable and emotional in being trusted like that,'' she said. Snowden, though taken by surprise, got used to it. ''As one might imagine, normally spies allergically avoid contact with reporters or media, so I was a virgin source -- everything was a surprise. . . . But we all knew what was at stake. The weight of the situation actually made it easier to focus on what was in the public interest rather than our own. I think we all knew there was no going back once she turned the camera on.'' For the next week, their preparations followed a similar pattern -- when they entered Snowden's room, they would remove their cellphone batteries and place them in the refrigerator of Snowden's minibar. They lined pillows against the door, to discourage eavesdropping from outside, then Poitras set up her camera and filmed. It was important to Snowden to explain to them how the government's intelligence machinery worked because he feared that he could be arrested at any time. Greenwald's first articles -- including the initial one detailing the Verizon order he read about on the flight to Hong Kong -- appeared while they were still in the process of interviewing Snowden. It made for a strange experience, creating the news together, then watching it spread. ''We could see it being covered,'' Poitras said. ''We were all surprised at how much attention it was getting. Our work was very focused, and we were paying attention to that, but we could see on TV that it was taking off. We were in this closed circle, and around us we knew that reverberations were happening, and they could be seen and they could be felt.'' Snowden told them before they arrived in Hong Kong that he wanted to go public. He wanted to take responsibility for what he was doing, Poitras said, and he didn't want others to be unfairly targeted, and he assumed he would be identified at some point. She made a 12½-minute video of him that was posted online June 9, a few days after Greenwald's first articles. It triggered a media circus in Hong Kong, as reporters scrambled to learn their whereabouts. There were a number of subjects that Poitras declined to discuss with me on the record and others she wouldn't discuss at all -- some for security and legal reasons, others because she wants to be the first to tell crucial parts of her story in her own documentary. Of her parting with Snowden once the video was posted, she would only say, ''We knew that once it went public, it was the end of that period of working.'' Snowden checked out of his hotel and went into hiding. Reporters found out where Poitras was staying -- she and Greenwald were at different hotels -- and phone calls started coming to her room. At one point, someone knocked on her door and asked for her by name. She knew by then that reporters had discovered Greenwald, so she called hotel security and arranged to be escorted out a back exit. She tried to stay in Hong Kong, thinking Snowden might want to see her again, and because she wanted to film the Chinese reaction to his disclosures. But she had now become a figure of interest herself, not just a reporter behind the camera. On June 15, as she was filming a pro-Snowden rally outside the U.S. consulate, a CNN reporter spotted her and began asking questions. Poitras declined to answer and slipped away. That evening, she left Hong Kong. Poitras flew directly to Berlin, where the previous fall she rented an apartment where she could edit her documentary without worrying that the F.B.I. would show up with a search warrant for her hard drives. ''There is a filter constantly between the places where I feel I have privacy and don't,'' she said, ''and that line is becoming increasingly narrow.'' She added: ''I'm not stopping what I'm doing, but I have left the country. I literally didn't feel like I could protect my material in the United States, and this was before I was contacted by Snowden. If you promise someone you're going to protect them as a source and you know the government is monitoring you or seizing your laptop, you can't actually physically do it.'' After two weeks in Berlin, Poitras traveled to Rio, where I then met her and Greenwald a few days later. My first stop was the Copacabana hotel, where they were working that day with MacAskill and another visiting reporter from The Guardian, James Ball. Poitras was putting together a new video about Snowden that would be posted in a few days on The Guardian's Web site. Greenwald, with several Guardian reporters, was working on yet another blockbuster article, this one about Microsoft's close collaboration with the N.S.A. The room was crowded -- there weren't enough chairs for everyone, so someone was always sitting on the bed or floor. A number of thumb drives were passed back and forth, though I was not told what was on them. Poitras and Greenwald were worried about Snowden. They hadn't heard from him since Hong Kong. At the moment, he was stuck in diplomatic limbo in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, the most-wanted man on the planet, sought by the U.S. government for espionage. (He would later be granted temporary asylum in Russia.) The video that Poitras was working on, using footage she shot in Hong Kong, would be the first the world had seen of Snowden in a month. ''Now that he's incommunicado, we don't know if we'll even hear from him again,'' she said. ''Is he O.K.?'' MacAskill asked. ''His lawyer said he's O.K.,'' Greenwald responded. ''But he's not in direct contact with Snowden,'' Poitras said When Greenwald got home that evening, Snowden contacted him online. Two days later, while she was working at Greenwald's house, Poitras also heard from him. It was dusk, and there was loud cawing and hooting coming from the jungle all around. This was mixed with the yapping of five or six dogs as I let myself in the front gate. Through a window, I saw Poitras in the living room, intently working at one of her computers. I let myself in through a screen door, and she glanced up for just a second, then went back to work, completely unperturbed by the cacophony around her. After 10 minutes, she closed the lid of her computer and mumbled an apology about needing to take care of some things. She showed no emotion and did not mention that she had been in the middle of an encrypted chat with Snowden. At the time, I didn't press her, but a few days later, after I returned to New York and she returned to Berlin, I asked if that's what she was doing that evening. She confirmed it, but said she didn't want to talk about it at the time, because the more she talks about her interactions with Snowden, the more removed she feels from them. ''It's an incredible emotional experience,'' she said, ''to be contacted by a complete stranger saying that he was going to risk his life to expose things the public should know. He was putting his life on the line and trusting me with that burden. My experience and relationship to that is something that I want to retain an emotional relation to.'' Her connection to him and the material, she said, is what will guide her work. ''I am sympathetic to what he sees as the horror of the world [and] what he imagines could come. I want to communicate that with as much resonance as possible. If I were to sit and do endless cable interviews -- all those things alienate me from what I need to stay connected to. It's not just a scoop. It's someone's life.'' Poitras and Greenwald are an especially dramatic example of what outsider reporting looks like in 2013. They do not work in a newsroom, and they personally want to be in control of what gets published and when. When The Guardian didn't move as quickly as they wanted with the first article on Verizon, Greenwald discussed taking it elsewhere, sending an encrypted draft to a colleague at another publication. He also considered creating a Web site on which they would publish everything, which he planned to call NSADisclosures. In the end, The Guardian moved ahead with their articles. But Poitras and Greenwald have created their own publishing network as well, placing articles with other outlets in Germany and Brazil and planning more for the future. They have not shared the full set of documents with anyone. ''We are in partnership with news organizations, but we feel our primary responsibility is to the risk the source took and to the public interest of the information he has provided,'' Poitras said. ''Further down on the list would be any particular news organization.'' Unlike many reporters at major news outlets, they do not attempt to maintain a facade of political indifference. Greenwald has been outspoken for years; on Twitter, he recently replied to one critic by writing: ''You are a complete idiot. You know that, right?'' His left political views, combined with his cutting style, have made him unloved among many in the political establishment. His work with Poitras has been castigated as advocacy that harms national security. ''I read intelligence carefully,'' said Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, shortly after the first Snowden articles appeared. ''I know that people are trying to get us. . . . This is the reason the F.B.I. now has 10,000 people doing intelligence on counterterrorism. . . . It's to ferret this out before it happens. It's called protecting America.'' Poitras, while not nearly as confrontational as Greenwald, disagrees with the suggestion that their work amounts to advocacy by partisan reporters. ''Yes, I have opinions,'' she told me. ''Do I think the surveillance state is out of control? Yes, I do. This is scary, and people should be scared. A shadow and secret government has grown and grown, all in the name of national security and without the oversight or national debate that one would think a democracy would have. It's not advocacy. We have documents that substantiate it.'' Poitras possesses a new skill set that is particularly vital -- and far from the journalistic norm -- in an era of pervasive government spying: she knows, as well as any computer-security expert, how to protect against surveillance. As Snowden mentioned, ''In the wake of this year's disclosure, it should be clear that unencrypted journalist-source communication is unforgivably reckless.'' A new generation of sources, like Snowden or Pfc. Bradley Manning, has access to not just a few secrets but thousands of them, because of their ability to scrape classified networks. They do not necessarily live in and operate through the established Washington networks -- Snowden was in Hawaii, and Manning sent hundreds of thousands of documents to WikiLeaks from a base in Iraq. And they share their secrets not with the largest media outlets or reporters but with the ones who share their political outlook and have the know-how to receive the leaks undetected. In our encrypted chat, Snowden explained why he went to Poitras with his secrets: ''Laura and Glenn are among the few who reported fearlessly on controversial topics throughout this period, even in the face of withering personal criticism, [which] resulted in Laura specifically becoming targeted by the very programs involved in the recent disclosures. She had demonstrated the courage, personal experience and skill needed to handle what is probably the most dangerous assignment any journalist can be given -- reporting on the secret misdeeds of the most powerful government in the world -- making her an obvious choice.'' Snowden's revelations are now the center of Poitras's surveillance documentary, but Poitras also finds herself in a strange, looking-glass dynamic, because she cannot avoid being a character in her own film. She did not appear in or narrate her previous films, and she says that probably won't change with this one, but she realizes that she has to be represented in some way, and is struggling with how to do that. She is also assessing her legal vulnerability. Poitras and Greenwald are not facing any charges, at least not yet. They do not plan to stay away from America forever, but they have no immediate plans to return. One member of Congress has already likened what they've done to a form of treason, and they are well aware of the Obama administration's unprecedented pursuit of not just leakers but of journalists who receive the leaks. While I was with them, they talked about the possibility of returning. Greenwald said that the government would be unwise to arrest them, because of the bad publicity it would create. It also wouldn't stop the flow of information. He mentioned this while we were in a taxi heading back to his house. It was dark outside, the end of a long day. Greenwald asked Poitras, ''Since it all began, have you had a non-N.S.A. day?'' ''What's that?'' she replied. ''I think we need one,'' Greenwald said. ''Not that we're going to take one.'' Poitras talked about getting back to yoga again. Greenwald said he was going to resume playing tennis regularly. ''I'm willing to get old for this thing,'' he said, ''but I'm not willing to get fat.'' Their discussion turned to the question of coming back to the United States. Greenwald said, half-jokingly, that if he was arrested, WikiLeaks would become the new traffic cop for publishing N.S.A. documents. ''I would just say: 'O.K., let me introduce you to my friend Julian Assange, who's going to take my place. Have fun dealing with him.' '' Poitras prodded him: ''So you're going back to the States?'' He laughed and pointed out that unfortunately, the government does not always take the smartest course of action. ''If they were smart,'' he said, ''I would do it.'' Poitras smiled, even though it's a difficult subject for her. She is not as expansive or carefree as Greenwald, which adds to their odd-couple chemistry. She is concerned about their physical safety. She is also, of course, worried about surveillance. ''Geolocation is the thing,'' she said. ''I want to keep as much off the grid as I can. I'm not going to make it easy for them. If they want to follow me, they are going to have to do that. I am not going to ping into any G.P.S. My location matters to me. It matters to me in a new way that I didn't feel before.'' There are lots of people angry with them and lots of governments, as well as private entities, that would not mind taking possession of the thousands of N.S.A. documents they still control. They have published only a handful -- a top-secret, headline-grabbing, Congressional-hearing-inciting handful -- and seem unlikely to publish everything, in the style of WikiLeaks. They are holding onto more secrets than they are exposing, at least for now. ''We have this window into this world, and we're still trying to understand it,'' Poitras said in one of our last conversations. ''We're not trying to keep it a secret, but piece the puzzle together. That's a project that is going to take time. Our intention is to release what's in the public interest but also to try to get a handle on what this world is, and then try to communicate that.'' The deepest paradox, of course, is that their effort to understand and expose government surveillance may have condemned them to a lifetime of it. ''Our lives will never be the same,'' Poitras said. ''I don't know if I'll ever be able to live someplace and feel like I have my privacy. That might be just completely gone.'' "
Twitter Toughening Its Security to Thwart Government Snoops,"A year ago, hardly anyone, save for cryptographers, had heard of Perfect Forward Secrecy. Now, some customers are demanding it, and technology companies are adding it, one by one, in large part to make government eavesdropping more difficult. On Friday, Twitter will announce that it has added Perfect Forward Secrecy, after similar announcements by Google, Mozilla and Facebook. The technology adds an extra layer of security to Web encryption to thwart eavesdropping, or at least make the National Security Agency's job much, much harder.  Until Edward J. Snowden began leaking classified documents last summer, billions of people relied on a more common type of security called Transport Layer Security or Secure Sockets Layer (S.S.L.) technology to protect the transmission of sensitive data like passwords, financial details, intellectual property and personal information. That technology is familiar to many Web users through the ""https"" and padlock symbol at the beginning of Web addresses that are encrypted.   But leaked N.S.A. documents make clear that the agency is recording high volumes of encrypted Internet traffic and retaining it for later cryptanalysis. And it's hardly the only one: Iran, North Korea, and China all store vast amounts of Internet traffic. More recently, Saudi Arabia has been actively trying to intercept mobile data for Twitter and other communication tools. The reason governments go to great lengths to store scrambled data is that if they later get the private S.S.L. keys to decrypt that data - via court order, hacking into a company's servers where they are stored or through cryptanalysis - they can go back and decrypt past communications for millions of users. Perfect Forward Secrecy ensures that even if an organization recording web traffic gets access to a company's private keys, it cannot go back and unscramble past communications all at once. Perfect Forward Secrecy encrypts each web session with an ephemeral key that is discarded once the session is over. A determined adversary could still decrypt past communications, but with Perfect Forward Secrecy the keys for each individual session would have to be cracked to read the sessions' contents. Perfect Forward Secrecy was invented more than 20 years ago, and Paul Kocher, a leading cryptographer, put support for Perfect Forward Secrecy into the S.S.L .protocol. But companies have been reluctant to use it because it slows website and browser performance, uses resources and because - until Snowden - most consumers did not even know it existed. Unlike S.S.L. technology, there is no indication to a user that Perfect Forward Secrecy is enabled. This tougher security is quickly becoming a must-have for Internet companies. Earlier this week, Marissa Mayer, the chief executive of Yahoo, announced that Yahoo would introduce new security features in 2014. But, on Twitter, some consumers were quick to point out that Perfect Forward Secrecy was conspicuously absent from her blog post. ""With security, there are always the things you know you ought to do,"" Mr. Kocher said in an interview. ""But it's not until you have a clear adversary that it's much easier to justify the resources to go fix the problem."" At Twitter, Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, a security engineer, had been pushing the company to adopt forward secrecy for some time, but did not get much support for the project until the Snowden leaks. That showed ""there really were organizations out there in the world that were scooping up encrypted data just so they could try to attack it at a large scale,"" said Jeff Hodges, another Twitter software engineer. ""We were like, oh, we need to actually spend some more time and really do this right."" Actually installing and turning on the technology took only a few months, once Twitter decided to do it, both men said in an interview. That was in part because Google, an early pioneer in the technology, had worked out many of the kinks in Perfect Forward Secrecy and shared its knowledge with the security community. Perfect Forward Secrecy does add a slight delay to a user's initial connection to Twitter - about 150 milliseconds in the United States and up to a second in countries like Brazil that are farther away from Twitter's servers. But the company said the extra protection was worth the delay. Twitter said it turned on Perfect Forward Secrecy on Oct. 21, although it refrained from publicizing the change immediately to make sure there were no problems. Twitter said it hoped that its example would prompt other companies to adopt the technology.  ""A lot of services that don't think they need it actually do,"" Mr. Hodges said.  "
Investigation Expands,"LONDON -- Four men arrested in Britain on drug charges are being investigated over their suspected ties to Silk Road, an online marketplace that has been linked to narcotics sales and other illegal activity, British officials said on Tuesday.  The National Crime Agency of Britain said it took four men into custody last week, hours after the arrest in San Francisco of Ross Ulbricht, who American authorities say was the owner of Silk Road. Mr. Ulbricht, 29, was charged last week with conspiracy to commit narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and other charges. The arrests represent the first major initiative by the N.C.A., a newly formed national police agency that the British government hopes will serve as the equivalent of the F.B.I. in the United States. N.C.A. officials say they are planning a wider campaign to fight crime in the dark corners of the Internet. ''These arrests send a clear message to criminals; the hidden Internet isn't hidden and your anonymous activity isn't anonymous,'' said Keith Bristow, the N.C.A.'s director general. ''We know where you are, what you are doing and we will catch you.'' The four men were taken into custody after N.C.A. officers, working closely with American law enforcement, identified several people they believed to be ''significant users'' of Silk Road, the British police said. Their identities of the men were not released on Tuesday. In documents last week, American prosecutors in New York said Silk Road was used to sell a variety of illegal drugs, including ecstasy, marijuana and heroin. Users also anonymously offered computer hacking services, forged documents and pirated movies, authorities in the United States said. The only form of payment accepted on the Web site was bitcoins, a virtual currency. American officials seized about 26,000 bitcoins valued at about $3.6 million last week and shut down the online marketplace. A public defender who represented Mr. Ulbricht at a hearing in San Francisco last week after his arrest has declined to comment on the case. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
The Bitcoin Ideology,"A metropolitan reporter for The New York Times. IF you've only recently tuned in to the seemingly endless conversation about bitcoin, you could be forgiven for thinking that the digital currency is little more than the latest Wall Street fetish or a juiced-up version of PayPal. After all, so many headlines in the last few weeks have focused on its market price and the cool stuff you can get with it: Bitcoin breaks $1,000! Bitcoin plunges by a half! Bitcoin has a banner Black Friday! Use bitcoin to buy a ride on Richard Branson's starship! But all the talk about bitcoin's value (or lack thereof) obscures the fact that it was never really meant as an investment nor primarily as a way to purchase sex toys or alpaca socks -- let alone a brand-new Lamborghini. One could argue that bitcoin isn't chiefly a commercial venture at all, a funny thing to say about a kind of online cash. To its creators and numerous disciples, bitcoin is -- and always has been -- a mostly ideological undertaking, more philosophy than finance.  ''The ideas behind it -- that's what attracted me,'' said Elizabeth Ploshay, a regular writer for Bitcoin magazine, which describes its mission as being ''the most accurate and up-to-date source of information, news and commentary about bitcoin.'' And if the magazine has a mission, so, too, does the subject that it covers. As Ms. Ploshay explained it, bitcoin isn't merely money; it's ''a movement'' -- a crusade in the costume of a currency. Depending on whom you talk to, the goal is to unleash repressed economies, to take down global banking or to wage a war against the Federal Reserve. For those with an uncertain understanding of its history, bitcoin entered the world on Jan. 3, 2009, when a shadowy hacker -- or team of hackers -- working under the name Satoshi Nakamoto released an ingenious string of computer code that established a system permitting people to transfer money to one another online, directly, anonymously and outside government control, in much the way that Napster once allowed the unrestrained transfer of music files. In a 500-word essay that accompanied the code, Nakamoto suggested that the motive for creating bitcoin was anger at the financial crisis: ''The root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.'' It was fundamentally a political document and, as such, it attracted followers among libertarian and anarchist groups who saw in bitcoin a means of removing the money supply from the grasping hands of government. In blog posts and at bitcoin conferences around the globe, these evangelists began to spread its gospel. It is only in the last few months, as bitcoin has attracted the attention of political parties, regulators and speculative investors that the narrative of bitcoin as a tool for change has been drowned out by a simpler story line: that of bitcoin as a kind of crypto-credit card -- or, even more, as a digitized casino game. ''Price is the least interesting thing about bitcoin,'' said Roger Ver, an early investor who is often called, in a typical movement phrase, the Bitcoin Jesus. ''At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. We saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state.'' While the bitcoin hype has inspired Ron Paulian dreams of evading inflation and undermining the Federal Reserve, the currency has also gained cachet among less conspicuously conservative adherents, like the founders of BitPesa, a start-up firm in Nairobi, Kenya, that plans to help Africans abroad send money to their families at home. According to the World Bank, $1.3 billion in remittances is sent each year to Kenya, a process that costs about $110 million in fees. By using bitcoin's peer-to-peer technology to avoid banks and wire-transfer companies like Western Union, BitPesa hopes to reduce these fees by two-thirds, saving ordinary Africans $74 million annually. You know you're talking to a true bitcoin believer if you hear the word ''disruption.'' But that's how bitcoin is seen within the broader movement: as an unruly tool with potentially transformative effects on entrenched businesses like retail payment and asset management. ''Right now in the United States, bitcoin is mainly considered a get-rich-quick scheme with a little financial privacy thrown in,'' said Jon Matonis, the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, the self-proclaimed center of the decentralized crusade. ''But its larger implications down the road are major disruptions to certain legacy industries.'' Mr. Matonis added that the ideology of bitcoin was wide enough to accommodate people on all points on the spectrum -- ''from libertarian capitalists to socialists.'' It not only has a following among the anti-central bank crowd, he said; it has also proved attractive to communitarians like the residents of the Kreuzberg neighborhood in Berlin, which now boasts the highest density of businesses accepting bitcoin in the world. There are even those who see bitcoin as the ultimate alternative to the global banking system. Ryan Singer, a co-founder of the bitcoin exchange Tradehill, based in San Francisco, compared the currency to email, conjecturing that it would gradually supplant traditional banking, just as digital messaging displaced handwritten letters. ''When kids wake up to the fact that they don't need their parents' help to create a bitcoin wallet,'' Mr. Singer said, ''when they can use bitcoins for free international transactions, at any hour, in every major city on the planet, then you'll know that something has changed.'' Perhaps the best proof of bitcoin's ideological underpinnings is that a schism has emerged in recent weeks between moderate elements in the movement who sense the necessity of cooperating with officialdom, and a more uncompromising faction that wants to keep bitcoin free from any government regulation. The hard-line bloc is exemplified by the crypto-anarchist developers of a bitcoin product called Dark Wallet, which is scheduled to be introduced next year and will include extra protections to ensure that bitcoin transactions remain secure, anonymous and difficult to trace. ''We see this as part of the total sublation of the state,'' said Cody Wilson, Dark Wallet's director, who gained fame earlier this year when he published online the blueprints to a pistol that could be manufactured with a 3-D printer. ''I know I sound like some kind of weird Jehovah's Witness, but we've only just begun. We admit that we are ideologues.'' "
Daily Report: Systems for Moving Anonymous Cash Abound Online,"Experts say there are hundreds of Internet payment systems that do not require users to identify themselves, making it difficult to seize on money laundering operations, Nicole Perlroth reports in The New York Times.  For eight years, Ernie Allen, the head of the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, has worked to prevent child pornographers from moving illicit profits through the systems of major banks and credit card companies. Mr. Allen's organization has collaborated with them, as well as with Internet service providers, payment processors and Internet companies like Google and Microsoft, hoping to follow the money and quash child pornography for good. But at some point the money trail went cold. For the last year, Mr. Allen has been working with global law enforcement and financial leaders to find out why. He may be getting closer to an answer. Today, cybersecurity experts say billions of dollars made from child pornography and illicit sales of things like national secrets and drugs are being moved through anonymous Internet payment systems like Liberty Reserve, the currency exchange whose operators were indicted on Tuesday for laundering $6 billion. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, described it as the largest online money-laundering case in history. ""What we have concluded is that illegal enterprises - commercial child pornography, human trafficking, drug trafficking, weapons trafficking and organized crime - has largely moved to an unregulated system that is not connected to any central bank or national authority,"" Mr. Allen said. ""The key to all of this has been anonymity."" Liberty Reserve was shut down last weekend, but cybersecurity experts said it was just one among hundreds of anonymous Internet payment systems. They said online systems like the Moscow-based WebMoney, Perfect Money, based in Panama, and CashU, which serves the Middle East and North Africa, require little more than a valid e-mail address to initiate an account. The names and locations of the actual users are unknown and can be easily fabricated. And they worry that the no-questions-asked verification system has created a safe harbor for illicit activity.

S.E.C. Says Texas Man Operated Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme,"Regulators have cracked down on an alleged Ponzi scheme involving the virtual currency bitcoin as they issue a more general warning about the dangers of such scams for investors. A Texas man, Trendon T. Shavers, was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday and accused of running a fund that collected bitcoins from investors, promising them 7 percent weekly returns. Mr. Shaver ended up selling some of the bitcoins and using the proceeds for his ""rent, car-related expenses, utilities, retail purchases, casinos, and meals,"" according to the complaint.  Investors have been willing to pay significant real money for bitcoin since the currency was created by anonymous computer programmers in 2009. As the value of the digital coins has skyrocketed, so has attention from regulators around the world, who have worried about the potential for fraud and money laundering.  In an investor alert released Tuesday, the S.E.C. warned, ""We are concerned that the rising use of virtual currencies in the global marketplace may entice fraudsters to lure investors into Ponzi and other schemes in which these currencies are used to facilitate fraudulent, or simply fabricated, investments or transactions.""  In the complaint, the agency said that Mr. Shavers, using the online name ""pirateat40,"" began advertising the Bitcoin Savings and Trust in 2011 on online forums in 2011. Mr. Shavers promised to make money trading the coins online and deliver the profits to his investors. He ended up collecting more than 700,000 bitcoins, according to the complaint. Those would have been worth about $4.5 million using the conversion rate in 2012, and more than $65 million at today's rate.  The S.E.C. is asking a federal court in Texas to freeze Mr. Shaver's assets while the case moves ahead.  Mr. Shaver could not be reached for a comment.   "
"For Bitcoin, Square Peg Meets Round Hole Under the Law","The advent of a new medium to conduct business inevitably means avenues for criminals to swoop in to take advantage.  The development of Bitcoin, the virtual currency that is not issued by any government, presents challenges for the authorities to use laws that were not designed for the digital world to combat illegal conduct. DealBook reported on ""fraud, hacking and outright theft that have become an increasingly regular part of the virtual currency world."" Bitcoin itself is neither good nor bad, just a new means to conduct business, but virtual currency operates in ways that make it harder to prosecute violations.  The value of the Bitcoins  available now is quite small, totaling approximately $12 billion.  Yet the perception that growing acceptance of virtual currencies will change the way business operates means governments will have to figure out how to deal with new forms of crime. There is a Wild West quality to Bitcoin, created out of a libertarian bent that connotes a world beyond government regulation.  Like any currency, it carries with it a degree of anonymity, much as the phrase ""cash is an orphan"" signals that  money can be largely untraceable once put into circulation.  More than ordinary cash, though, Bitcoin operates largely outside the current banking system, making it even more difficult to trace transactions. Reports of Bitcoins being stolen from the ""wallets"" of users looks much like any other type of theft. Under the traditional common law of larceny, however, stealing virtual currency would not be the subject of a prosecution because the law applies only to the removal of physical items. Modern theft statutes allow for prosecution for the taking of intangible property, so the greater challenge is pursuing thefts that occur in cyberspace.  State authorities often do not have the resources to pursue crimes on the Internet nor the ability to coordinate investigations with foreign governments when the misconduct occurred outside the United States.   The Justice Department is often better equipped to pursue global crimes, but the statutes available to pursue the theft of Bitcoins are more limited.  Unlike the states, there is no general federal theft statute, so prosecutors have to be more creative in pursing misconduct. There is a federal law used to prosecute the interstate transportation of stolen property, but it applies only to cases involving ""goods, wares and merchandise."" In Dowling v. United States, the Supreme Court limited the reach of this law to the theft of physical items and not intangible property like virtual currency. The statute also covers transporting ""money,"" but that would not appear to cover a virtual currency sponsored by private issuers. Another law that could be used is a provision in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes it a crime to use a computer with the intent to defraud in obtaining anything of value from the victim.  Whether stealing Bitcoins from an owner's account would constitute fraud is unclear. If there is a scheme to mislead an owner of Bitcoins to part with them, then the broad federal wire fraud statute can be easier to use because it does not require proving misuse of a computer. And unlike the stolen property provision, this law covers both tangible and intangible property, so virtual currency would fit comfortably within it. A greater challenge to law enforcement is the lack of transparency in Bitcoin transactions, which can allow virtual currency to facilitate money laundering. Federal prosecutors convicted the administrator of the website Silk Road, which was used to distribute narcotics bought with virtual currency.  The government seized nearly 175,000 Bitcoins, so  clearly virtual currency can be used to buy drugs as if it were cash on a street corner. One potential challenge to pursuing money-laundering charges involving Bitcoin is the definition of the transactions subject to prosecution.The statute applies to a ""financial transaction"" involving a ""monetary instrument,"" which includes ""coin or currency of the United States or of any other country.""  That definition would appear to exclude Bitcoin because it does not have any connection to a government.  Another provision applies to transactions in which a ""financial institution"" is involved, which includes banks and brokerage firms along with money services businesses that transmit money.  Transactions in virtual currency take place largely outside typical financial firms, so trading may fall beyond the reach of the money-laundering laws unless providers qualify as a money services business. To extend the scope of the financial disclosure laws, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the Treasury Department, issued guidance in March requiring administrators and exchangers of virtual currencies to report transactions, including the identity of Bitcoin traders.  That means those involved in ""mining"" Bitcoins for sale or operating a trading venue are considered a money transmitter, which could qualify them as a ""financial institution"" for purposes of the money-laundering laws. Currency, even the virtual type, is usually not understood to be a security or a commodity subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  But when packaged for investors, Bitcoins could fall under the jurisdiction of those agencies. Whenever something rises substantially in value, like Bitcoin's increase of nearly 1,000 percent over the last month, investment offers will crop up to tap into the potential riches.  The S.E.C.filed a lawsuit in July accusing a Texas man of engaging in a Ponzi scheme by offering Bitcoin-denominated investments. The definition of a security [link below] includes an ""investment contract,"" which can be almost anything as long as it involves a commitment of money to others to generate profits from their efforts.  The Supreme Court has found that investments in orange groves and pay telephones can qualify as a security subject to the S.E.C.'s jurisdiction, so investments in virtual currency could fall under the agency's purview. Packaging Bitcoins together for future delivery could also qualify as a commodity subject to regulation by the C.F.T.C. As The New York Times reported, the People's Bank of China and four other Chinese agencies issued a notice that Bitcoin is a ""virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency."" As Bitcoin gains wider acceptance, the tax collector will most likely seek the government's cut of the transactions. For those paid in virtual currency, the federal tax law provides that ""gross income means all income from whatever source derived,"" about as broad a definition as possible. For those who mine Bitcoins, they can be considered a capital asset generating capital gains when sold that must be reported. Any failure to pay taxes can bring about both civil and criminal penalties, which are not yet payable in Bitcoin. The rise of virtual currencies may have started out as an effort to avoid government scrutiny.  But with greater acceptance comes increased regulation, including the application of criminal laws to this new medium for conducting business. "
A Deal That Could Benefit Mobile Users,"A federal government committee has cleared the proposed acquisition of Sprint by SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications company, after securing concessions from both of them that should address national security concerns about the deal. Though they still have to clear a few more hurdles, the deal's approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is encouraging news.  SoftBank is offering to buy a 70 percent stake in Sprint for $12.1 billion and to invest a further $8 billion in the company. The deal, if approved by the Federal Communications Commission and Sprint's shareholders, should make the telecommunications industry more competitive by providing consumers better and cheaper choices for phone and broadband connections. It should also help Sprint, which has long struggled financially, compete more effectively with the much larger companies that dominate the industry, AT&T and Verizon. In recent days, a rival suitor for Sprint, the satellite-TV company Dish Network, and some members of Congress, like Senator Charles Schumer of New York, have raised vague and unpersuasive security concerns about SoftBank. They have alleged that the Japanese company might not be fit to control an American telecommunications network because its own wireless network in Japan uses equipment from Chinese manufacturers like Huawei, which have close ties to the Chinese government, according to a report by a House committee. This connection, they argue, could somehow make American networks more vulnerable to Chinese hacking or cyberespionage. To counter these fears, SoftBank has agreed to give the United States government the right to approve some equipment purchases by the company and to let it approve one director on Sprint's board who would be in charge of national security issues. SoftBank also says it will spend $1 billion to remove Huawei equipment already installed in the network of Clearwire, an American wireless broadband company that Sprint is seeking to acquire fully. SoftBank would not be the first big foreign investor in an American telecommunications company. Deutsche Telekom of Germany owns a majority stake in T-Mobile USA, and Vodafone of Britain owns 45 percent of Verizon Wireless. The fact that SoftBank is based in Japan, which like Germany and Britain is a vital American ally, should allay concerns that this deal would put critical infrastructure in the hands of a threatening foreign power. SoftBank has competed aggressively in Japan with a former telephone monopoly, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, or N.T.T., by sharply cutting prices for broadband and cellphone services. The company was largely responsible for making high-speed Internet affordable to consumers in the early 2000s by offering faster service and at prices that were less than half of N.T.T.'s rates. A few years later, it used a similar low-price strategy in the wireless business. If it competes aggressively in the United States, SoftBank could help shake up the highly concentrated American industry. The wireless industry is dominated by four national providers, and most consumers have either one or two choices for high-speed Internet service at home. Its record should help SoftBank secure the approval of the F.C.C., which is reviewing whether the deal is in the public interest. Ultimately, the final say on who acquires Sprint, SoftBank or Dish Network will rest with the shareholders of Sprint. That is as it should be. In such contested corporate battles, policy makers should watch from the sidelines, not try to tilt the playing field. "
A Disaster-Resistant Backup Drive Built Like a Tank,"The simple argument for cloud backup services is that if your house burns down, all your physical backup drives burn with it. The argument against cloud backup services is that they are expensive and slow -- it can take days to upload the contents of a modest computer.  The ioSafe N2 backup drive aims to provide more speed and lower cost than cloud services, while being just as disaster-proof. And to a degree, it succeeds. The N2 is a 28-pound tank of an external drive, built to protect up to four terabytes of data from fire (or at least 1,550-degree heat) and water (or at least 10 feet of it for up to 72 hours). It puts two drives in a waterproof case that is wrapped in a chemical fire retardant and packed inside a fan-cooled steel case. A black box about 12 inches by 9 inches by 6 inches, it's not exactly a stylish desk accessory. The backup contains two drives, and each copies the same data, providing another layer of safety. The drives range from one to four terabytes. The N2 plugs into a Wi-Fi router and takes data over the wireless network. That allows remote access to the data. And that is where the N2 may not appeal to people who worry about hackers compromising their cloud accounts. Putting the backup on your network makes it vulnerable to attack. But ioSafe makes another waterproof and fireproof backup called the Solo (starting at $300 for 2 terabytes of storage), which wires directly to a computer without using a network. I was able to load 260 gigabytes of files in just under six hours, far less time than it has taken me to test cloud services in the past. But setup required help from the company's tech assistance, as did gaining access to it from another computer. Whether it is a good deal compared with a cloud service is contingent on the particular service and the amount of data to be stored. The N2, depending on the size of the drives and extras, like extended insurance, can cost $900 to $3,750. By comparison, Carbonite cloud service costs $1,100 a year for a business subscription with 1 terabyte of storage. If the worst happens and your N2 is burned or drowned, ioSafe includes up to $2,500 worth of data recovery services in its one-year guarantee. ROY FURCHGOTT "
"After Hijackings, Twitter Adds Two-Step Security Feature"," 4:41 p.m. | Updated  with additional information about security vulnerabilities and new claims of patent infringement.  On Wednesday, Twitter introduced two-factor authentication, a security feature that makes it harder for hackers to hijack users' accounts. The rollout follows months of high-profile Twitter hijackings. Syrian hackers have hijacked Twitter accounts of more than a dozen prominent media outlets, from The Associated Press and The Financial Times to The Onion, a parody site, over the past few months. Those attacks - and other break-ins of Twitter accounts for Jeep and Burger King - showed the ease with which Twitter accounts could be cracked. They also elicited much criticism from security experts, who questioned why a company with more than a billion dollars in venture financing, and more than 200 million active users, did not offer two-factor authentication.  Two-factor authentication sends users a second, one-time log-in code by text message to make it harder for a hacker to crack into an account with just the main password. Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Google all offer users two-factor authentication. In a blog post, Twitter said that it would begin offering the two-step authentication procedure, which is voluntary on the part of users, on Wednesday. Two-step authentication is by no means foolproof. Twitter accounts for larger brands and news outlets are often managed by several employees, but only one employee would receive the log-in code. In those cases, other employees would only be able to access the account from their usual devices, or would need to get the one-time code from the administrator- a hassle that may discourage brands from using the security feature altogether. ""You can't close all of the gaps with just one step,"" said Mark Risher, a co-founder of Impermium, a security start-up focused on social media. ""People may not turn this on because it's a hassle.  And even when it is turned on, there are vulnerabilities."" Even with two-factor authentication enabled, attackers could still hijack a user's account by impersonating Twitter in what is known as a man-in-the-middle attack. ""It still raises the bar, and makes hacking into an account significantly harder,"" said Mr. Risher. A Twitter representative said the rollout was delayed because the company needed to update its SMS, or text message, architecture. To use the feature, users will need to update their account settings and register their mobile phone numbers, so Twitter can send them a one-time, six-digit code when they log in. Within minutes of Twitter announcing two-step verification, there were already claims of patent infringement. Kim Dotcom, the Internet tycoon charged with pirating copyrighted material and money laundering, tweeted that he had patented the technology behind two factor authentication. ""Google, Facebook, Twitter, Citibank, etc. offer two-step authentication,"" Mr. Dotcom tweeted. ""Massive IP infringement by U.S. companies. My innovation. My patent."" Mr. Dotcom's wasn't alone in claiming infringement. Last month, after Microsoft began offering two-factor authentication, a Microsoft subsidiary, PhoneFactor, was sued by StrikeForce Technologies, which claimed its patents had been infringed. StrikeForce, an Edison, N.J., maker of authentication technology, claimed that it was the ""sole patent holder for out-of-band authentication."" The company plans to expand its patent suit beyond Microsoft to other technology companies that now offer two-factor authentication, according to a StrikeForce investor. A Twitter representative said the patent suit did not play a part in being slow to introduce the service. In its blog post, Twitter said much of the work it did to offer two-factor authentication would allow it to offer additional security features. ""Much of the server-side engineering work required to ship this feature has cleared the way for us to deliver more account security enhancements in the future,"" Twitter wrote. ""Stay tuned.""  "
New Vulnerability Found in Apps Using Wi-Fi,"Public Wi-Fi networks are notoriously insecure, and now there's this: Mobile security researchers have discovered a new way for attackers to access mobile phone apps from Wi-Fi networks.  On Tuesday, mobile security researchers will demonstrate a simple attack that exploits a vulnerability in the code within apps that run on Apple's iOS operating system. The vulnerability allows attackers to persistently alter the server URL from which a mobile app loads its data, so that instead of loading data from realserver.com, for instance, the attack makes the app load data from attacker.com, without the victim knowing. Attackers could use that data to load malicious links, or insert fake, market-moving news into a news app. The researchers from Skycure, a mobile security company, said that in the past they had alerted app makers to a vulnerability before making it public. In this case, however, they said such responsible disclosure was all but impossible because the vulnerability was present in hundreds of apps they tested, including stock management and news apps. They declined to name the apps affected for fear attackers would use the knowledge and exploit it. (However, the Skycure researchers said The New York Times app was not affected.) ""The vulnerability affects so many apps that it's virtually impossible to alert app makers,"" said Yair Amit, Skycure's chief technology officer. The researchers put together a short video demonstrating how attackers can manipulate an app. They use what is called a 301 directive to redirect the traffic flow from an app to an app maker's server to the attackers' server. [Video: On Tuesday, Skycure researchers will demonstrate how a simple vulnerability allows attackers to permanently manipulate iOS apps.  Watch on YouTube.] The same researchers uncovered a separate vulnerability last year in which LinkedIn was pulling members' calendar entries on iPhones and iPads - including details about meeting locations, participants, dial-in information, passwords and sensitive meeting notes  - back to its servers. Following disclosure, LinkedIntweaked its code to stop taking notes from private calendar appointments.  "
Researchers Hack Webcam While Disabling Warning Lights,"If you're sitting at your computer reading this, smile, you could be on camera. Actually, don't smile. Last week, researchers at Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science showed off an exploit that allows a hacker to take over some MacBook computers and activate their Web cameras without the users' knowledge.  The webcam hacking technique, first reported by The Washington Post, is said to be similar to a tactic used to spy on Cassidy Wolf, a 19-year-old Miss Teen USA, who fell victim to a webcam hacker earlier this year. The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested the man responsible for the spying on Ms. Wolf. He pleaded guilty to charges in connection with his spying on her and a number of other women, using software that could snap a picture or record video of them without warning. The Johns Hopkins paper, titled ""iSeeYou: Disabling the MacBook Webcam Indicator LED,"" explains how the researchers were able to reprogram an iSight camera's microcontroller to activate the recording functions and LED activation lights independently to spy on someone without giving that person any idea that the computer camera is in use. Stephen Checkoway, an assistant research professor at Johns Hopkins and a co-author of the study, noted that as of now, the exploit works only on 2008 Apple products. ""The ubiquitous webcam indicator LED is an important privacy feature, which provides a visual cue that the camera is turned on,"" the researchers wrote in the paper. By turning off the light, the security experts were able to capture video and photos without any indication to the person using the computer. Mr. Checkoway has been tracking security issues for some time and is a member of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute,. He wrote the paper with Matthew Brocker, another researcher. There have been past reports of people being spied on with webcams. Last year, seven computer rental companies agreed to a settlement with the federal government after it was discovered that they were unlawfully capturing photos of customers by using illicit software that controlled a computer's webcam. The webcam software, called PC Rental Agent, had been installed on approximately 420,000 computers worldwide, according to the Federal Trade Commission, and was used to spy on thousands of people. Security experts have warned that webcams are susceptible to hacking, and say there is only really one solution that can guarantee no one is spying on you: a piece of tape stuck over your computer camera.

The President Revives an Old Debate About Privacy," Few expect Internet privacy legislation in Congress this year. But many were heartened that the ""p"" word came up at all in the State of Union address Tuesday night.  The Obama administration's latest salvo resurrects a difficult, urgent debate over keeping Americans safe online and respecting their privacy.  His executive order on cybersecurity, issued Tuesday, sought to strike a balance. It asked government agencies to share with private companies what intelligence they have about computer security threats; but it did not ask the private sector to share its own information with the government. The president, in his State of the Union address, explicitly cited the need to protect both ""national security"" and ""privacy.""   The White House order reopens rather than settles an argument that computer scientists, lawyers and civil liberties groups have been having for years over whether increased surveillance of our digital lives will make us safer. It has been fought over body scanners at the airport and surveillance cameras on the street. But expect a new political brawl on this. Both sides have powerful advocates in Washington.  On one side are proponents of greater ""information sharing"" between the government and the private sector. A bill proposed Wednesday, by Representatives Mike Rogers, a Republican from Michigan, and C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat from Maryland, would permit the flow of intelligence from private companies to government agencies.  An earlier version of the bill passed the House of Representatives last year, but failed in the Senate amid the threat of a White House veto. Mr. Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, took pains tosay that the new legislation would protect civil liberties.  But that did not reassure many civil libertarians. The Center for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, warned Wednesday that the bill, the Cyberintelligence Sharing and Protection Act, known as Cispa, could allow private communications to be shared with the National Security Agency, part of the Defense Department. ""Once that private information is in the hands of the military, it can be used for purposes completely unrelated to cybersecurity,"" argued Leslie Harris, the group's president. ""In seeking to promote cybersecurity information sharing, Cispa creates a sweeping exception to all privacy laws."" Another advocacy group, called Fight for the Future, which agitated successfully against antipiracy legislation last year, set up an online petition in an effort to defeat Cispa.  The American Civil Liberties Union, likewise, criticized the House bill, and gave its blessings to the White House executive order instead. ""Two cheers for cybersecurity programs that can do something besides spy on Americans,"" the group said in a blog post. The presidential order has been criticized by others for lacking enforcement teeth. It does not give the government the power to set minimum standards for how private operators of power plants and other critical infrastructure should protect their computer systems to deter attack; that would require Congress to change current law.  Meanwhile, the debate over privacy and security continues to be stuck in what Daniel J. Solove, a law professor at George Washington University, calls a false trade-off. In his 2011 book ""Nothing to Hide: The False Trade-Off Between Privacy and Security,"" Mr. Solove argues that Americans in the post-Sept. 11 era have been increasingly persuaded to trade ""privacy"" for ""security,"" with technology including video surveillance cameras, wiretapping and all kinds of digital data mining.  ""Privacy often loses out to security when it shouldn't,"" he writes.  The issue should not be seen, he adds, as a zero-sum game. ""Privacy often can be protected without undue cost to security,"" he continues. ""In instances when adequate compromises can't be achieved, the trade-off can be made in a manner that is fair to both sides. We can reach a better balance between privacy and security. We must. There is too much at stake to fail.""  "
An Eerie Silence on Cybersecurity,"Apart from a few companies like Google, which revealed that Chinese hackers had tried to read its users' e-mail messages, American companies have been disturbingly silent about cyberattacks on their computer systems -- apparently in fear that this disclosure will unnerve customers and shareholders and invite lawsuits and unwanted scrutiny from the government.  In some cases, such silence might violate the legal obligations of publicly traded companies to share material information about their businesses. Most companies would tell investors if an important factory burned to the ground or thieves made off with hundreds of millions of dollars in cash. So why do they feel that the theft of trade secrets that are often much more valuable do not deserve to be discussed? Companies might argue that it's hard to quantify the losses from cyberattacks, but that does not mean that they are costless. By keeping quiet, companies also make it more difficult for other businesses and the government to protect against similar attacks. Recent evidence suggests that cyberassaults against corporate and government systems are becoming more frequent and more sophisticated. Bringing these assaults into the open can make everybody more secure. President Obama's recent executive order encouraging voluntary sharing of information is a welcome step in that direction. This not about shaming companies. It is about protecting these companies as well as individuals against security breaches. A recent study showed that state laws that require companies to inform individuals about security breaches on personal information like credit card numbers have resulted in a modest drop in identity theft in those states. That suggests that timely disclosures give individuals the opportunity to take action to protect themselves and encourage corporate executives to increase efforts to protect their systems. In 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued nonbinding guidelines informing companies about their responsibilities under existing laws to report cyberattacks; the commission has also sent letters suggesting that companies reveal more information about the threats they encounter. If confirmed by Congress, Mary Jo White, Mr. Obama's choice to lead the agency, could strengthen the commission's efforts by making the guidelines binding. Big investors like pension funds should also demand more data from companies because as shareholders they lose when secrets are stolen. As more companies reveal breaches, the stigma of doing so fades. Recent reports in The Times that hackers in China attacked its computer systems appeared to encourage other newspapers to admit that they had been attacked, too. Executives should understand that openly discussing threats helps everyone become more alert to risks, which would be in their own long-term interest. "
U.S. Treasury Secretary and China's President Meet,"BEIJING -- Jacob J. Lew, the American Treasury secretary, met with President Xi Jinping of China on Tuesday in the first high-level encounter between American and Chinese officials since Mr. Xi assumed the presidency, and one that recognized sticking points in a relationship that has drifted in the last few months. Mr. Lew, 57, a master of the intricacies of the United States budget who has less foreign experience than his predecessors, raised the topic of cybersecurity, a significant issue in the relationship between Washington and Beijing, American officials said. He also talked about North Korea's nuclear program, a topic not normally on a Treasury secretary's agenda, they said.  Mr. Xi noted that while the United States and China had ''enormous shared interests, of course, unavoidably we have some differences.'' It has been unusual for Chinese leaders to draw attention to stark divisions with the United States. Mr. Xi's choice of words showed confidence that he could manage the problems, and hinted at a lowering of expectations about developing a strategic relationship with the United States, an idea that had been proffered in the past, diplomats here said. Contacts between Washington and Beijing have been sparse during China's political transition. It began in November when Mr. Xi took over as head of the Communist Party, and ended last week with his ascension to the presidency at the annual session of the National People's Congress. For reasons of protocol, President Obama did not speak with Mr. Xi until last week, when he called the new Chinese president to congratulate him and to outline the issues at hand, including North Korea and cybersecurity. The White House has directly accused China of widespread theft of data from American computer networks, including those of American businesses involved in the Chinese market. China's cyberespionage against American commercial interests has attracted attention in Congress that could have negative consequences for China, analysts said. ''If we don't see progress, that could increase the prospects for a political backlash that would lead to greater scrutiny of Chinese investment in the United States,'' said Myron A. Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. On North Korea, the Obama administration wants to know whether Beijing will enforce the new sanctions that the United Nations Security Council imposed on the North, with China voting in favor. The administration has also announced an expansion of missile defense capabilities in an effort to deter North Korea, a message that implied that China should restrain its nuclear-armed ally. Mr. Xi appeared to have gone out of his way to meet Mr. Lew before leaving Friday for his first foreign trip as president, which is to include two days in Moscow, followed by a three-nation tour of Africa. Mr. Lew is the first foreign official Mr. Xi has met as president, and Mr. Xi endowed some meaning to his phrase to Mr. Lew that he attached ''great importance'' to the relationship between China and the United States. At the same time, however, Chinese commentators have noted that Secretary of State John Kerry chose to make his first trip abroad an extended journey to Europe and the Middle East, unlike his predecessor, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who visited Asian nations first, including China. Mr. Kerry is expected to be in China next month as part of an Asian tour, administration officials said. This trip is Mr. Lew's first to China, according to administration officials. The previous two Treasury secretaries, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Timothy F. Geithner, were experts on China, and for the past seven years they played dominant roles in the relationship between the countries. Mr. Lew arrived in Beijing on Tuesday morning and went almost immediately to the Great Hall of the People. He was accompanied by Lael Brainard, under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, and Evan Medeiros, a senior official of the National Security Council who specializes in China. As Mr. Lew and Mr. Xi sat side by side in large, white-upholstered armchairs, Mr. Lew stressed in brief comments overheard by reporters that the United States had seen 14 quarters of economic growth, that the housing market was ''coming back,'' and that a ''revolution'' was under way in the energy sector, a reference to shale gas production. After that, reporters were ushered out. The meeting lasted about 45 minutes, according to Mr. Lew's aides. The secretary stressed the need for a relationship marked by ''healthy competition rather than strategic rivalry,'' a United States official said. Later, Mr. Lew met with Xu Shaoshi, the new chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, the powerful agency that manages the domestic economy. He had dinner with the new finance minister, Lou Jiwei, and Wednesday he is to meet with China's new prime minister, Li Keqiang. Mr. Lew had his first lunch in China at the Bao Yuan Dumpling House, an informal restaurant close to the United States Embassy. There, with two staff members, he ate a variety of house specialties, using chopsticks. The bill: roughly $6 a person. "
U.S. and China Put Focus on Cybersecurity,"BEIJING -- The United States and China held their highest-level military talks in nearly two years on Monday, with a senior Chinese general pledging to work with the United States on cybersecurity because the consequences of a major cyberattack ''may be as serious as a nuclear bomb.'' Cybersecurity has become a sudden source of tension between the two countries. China has bristled over the growing body of evidence that its military has been involved in cyberattacks on American corporations and some government agencies. Last month, the Obama administration demanded that the Chinese government stop the theft of data from American computer networks and help create global standards for cybersecurity.  At a news conference on Monday after talks with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the Chinese general, Fang Fenghui, said he would be willing to set up a cybersecurity ''mechanism,'' but warned that progress might not be swift. ''I know how difficult it is,'' General Fang said. ''Anyone can launch the attacks -- from the place where he lives, from his own country or from another country.'' General Dempsey arrived in Beijing on Sunday for his first visit to China. His predecessor, Adm. Mike Mullen, held talks in Beijing in July 2011. General Dempsey's three-day visit comes as mistrust has mounted between Beijing and Washington over a host of issues, including differences over North Korea, Washington's strengthened military posture in the Asia Pacific region, China's assertiveness in the South and East China Seas and basic problems of how the two militaries should communicate in a crisis. China invited General Dempsey for the talks after the lengthy transition process to a new Chinese government was completed in March. His arrival followed the first visit by Secretary of State John Kerry more than a week ago, and Obama administration officials say they hope the almost back-to-back talks will yield a starting point for better relations after a rocky period of drift. At the news conference, General Fang, who is the chief of the People's Liberation Army General Staff and a member of the powerful Central Military Commission, also talked of wanting a ''new kind of military relationship that is consistent with the state-to-state relationship.'' He spoke with a confidence that reflected the growing strength of China's military, including expanding its naval presence. ''The Pacific Ocean is wide enough to accommodate us both,'' General Fang said, a suggestion that it was time for the United States to understand the American military would not be able to dominate forever. President Xi Jinping used the same phrase on the eve of his visit to Washington as vice president in February 2012. General Dempsey did not allow the remark to go unnoticed. The United States, he said, is looking for a ''better, deeper and more enduring relationship'' with the Chinese military -- but in the context of ''other historic and enduring alliances.'' ''We do have treaty obligations,'' he said, a reference to the American alliances with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia. ''We will build and recognize the historic alliances, and there will be points when that creates friction.'' Defending the Obama administration's decision to ''pivot'' toward Asia -- a policy widely interpreted as a response to China's expanding influence -- General Dempsey said it was not as though ''we've disappeared and are about to reappear.'' He said he had told General Fang in their private conversation before the news conference that the United States sought to be a ''stabilizing'' factor and that the absence of the United States in the Asia Pacific region would be ''destabilizing.'' After a decade of concentrating on Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States will now carry out an Asia Pacific policy of ''three mores,'' General Dempsey said, bringing more interest, more engagement and more quality assets to the region. General Fang raised the issue of North Korea's latest nuclear test, a detonation in February just 100 miles from China's northeast border. ''North Korea has already concluded a third nuclear test, and it could conduct a fourth nuclear test,'' he said. China is North Korea's main ally and economic patron, and the United States has urged the Chinese to use their influence to halt the North's bombast and threats of nuclear attacks on American targets. General Fang reiterated that China was opposed to North Korea's developing nuclear weapons, and asked for a reopening of the so-called six-party talks that aimed to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear weapons program. The talks collapsed several years ago. "
Chinese Hackers Resume Attacks On U.S. Targets,"WASHINGTON -- Three months after hackers working for a cyberunit of China's People's Liberation Army went silent amid evidence that they had stolen data from scores of American companies and government agencies, they appear to have resumed their attacks using different techniques, according to computer industry security experts and American officials. The Obama administration had bet that ''naming and shaming'' the groups, first in industry reports and then in the Pentagon's own detailed survey of Chinese military capabilities, might prompt China's new leadership to crack down on the military's highly organized team of hackers -- or at least urge them to become more subtle. But Unit 61398, whose well-guarded 12-story white headquarters on the edges of Shanghai became the symbol of Chinese cyberpower, is back in business, according to American officials and security companies.  It is not clear precisely who has been affected by the latest attacks. Mandiant, a private security company that helps companies and government agencies defend themselves from hackers, said the attacks had resumed but would not identify the targets, citing agreements with its clients. But it did say the victims were many of the same ones the unit had attacked before. The hackers were behind scores of thefts of intellectual property and government documents over the past five years, according to a report by Mandiant in February that was confirmed by American officials. They have stolen product blueprints, manufacturing plans, clinical trial results, pricing documents, negotiation strategies and other proprietary information from more than 100 of Mandiant's clients, predominantly in the United States. According to security experts, the cyberunit was responsible for a 2009 attack on the Coca-Cola Company that coincided with its failed attempt to acquire the China Huiyuan Juice Group. In 2011, it attacked RSA, a maker of data security products used by American government agencies and defense contractors, and used the information it collected from that attack to break into the computer systems of Lockheed Martin, the aerospace contractor. More recently, security experts said, the group took aim at companies with access to the nation's power grid. Last September, it broke into the Canadian arm of Telvent, now Schneider Electric, which keeps detailed blueprints on more than half the oil and gas pipelines in North America. Representatives of Coca-Cola and Schneider Electric did not return requests for comment on Sunday. A Lockheed Martin spokesman said the company declined to comment. In interviews, Obama administration officials said they were not surprised by the resumption of the hacking activity. One senior official said Friday that ''this is something we are going to have to come back at time and again with the Chinese leadership,'' who, he said, ''have to be convinced there is a real cost to this kind of activity.'' Mandiant said that the Chinese hackers had stopped their attacks after they were exposed in February and removed their spying tools from the organizations they had infiltrated. But over the past two months, they have gradually begun attacking the same victims from new servers and have reinserted many of the tools that enable them to seek out data without detection. They are now operating at 60 percent to 70 percent of the level they were working at before, according to a study by Mandiant requested by The New York Times. The Times hired Mandiant to investigate an attack that originated in China on its news operations last fall. Mandiant is not currently working for The New York Times Company. Mandiant's findings match those of Crowdstrike, another security company that has also been tracking the group. Adam Meyers, director of intelligence at Crowdstrike, said that apart from a few minor changes in tactics, it was ''business as usual'' for the Chinese hackers. The subject of Chinese attacks is expected to be a central issue in an upcoming visit to China by President Obama's national security adviser, Thomas Donilon, who has said that dealing with China's actions in cyberspace is now moving to the center of the complex security and economic relationship between the two countries. But hopes for progress on the issue are limited. When the Pentagon released its report this month officially identifying the Chinese military as the source of years of attacks, the Chinese Foreign Ministry denied the accusation, and People's Daily, which reflects the views of the Communist Party, called the United States ''the real 'hacking empire,' '' saying it ''has continued to strengthen its network tools for political subversion against other countries.'' Other Chinese organizations and scholars cited American and Israeli cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear facilities as evidence of American hypocrisy. At the White House, Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said Sunday that ''what we have been seeking from China is for it to investigate our concerns and to start a dialogue with us on cyberissues.'' She noted that China ''agreed last month to start a new working group,'' and that the administration hoped to win ''longer-term changes in China's behavior, including by working together to establish norms against the theft of trade secrets and confidential business information.'' In a report to be issued Wednesday, a private task force led by Mr. Obama's former director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, and his former ambassador to China, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., lays out a series of proposed executive actions and Congressional legislation intended to raise the stakes for China. ''Jawboning alone won't work,'' Mr. Blair said Saturday. ''Something has to change China's calculus.'' The exposure of Unit 61398's actions, which have long been well known to American intelligence agencies, did not accomplish that task. One day after Mandiant and the United States government revealed the P.L.A. unit as the culprit behind hundreds of attacks on agencies and companies, the unit began a haphazard cleanup operation, Mandiant said. Attack tools were unplugged from victims' systems. Command and control servers went silent. And of the 3,000 technical indicators Mandiant identified in its initial report, only a sliver kept operating. Some of the unit's most visible operatives, hackers with names like ''DOTA,'' ''SuperHard'' and ''UglyGorilla,'' disappeared, as cybersleuths scoured the Internet for clues to their real identities. In the case of UglyGorilla, Web sleuths found digital evidence that linked him to a Chinese national named Wang Dong, who kept a blog about his experience as a P.L.A. hacker from 2006 to 2009, in which he lamented his low pay, long hours and instant ramen meals. But in the weeks that followed, the group picked up where it had left off. From its Shanghai headquarters, the unit's hackers set up new beachheads from compromised computers all over the world, many of them small Internet service providers and mom-and-pop shops whose owners do not realize that by failing to rigorously apply software patches for known threats, they are enabling state-sponsored espionage. ''They dialed it back for a little while, though other groups that also wear uniforms didn't even bother to do that,'' Kevin Mandia, the chief executive of Mandiant, said in an interview on Friday. ''I think you have to view this as the new normal.'' The hackers now use the same malicious software they used to break into the same organizations in the past, only with minor modifications to the code. While American officials and corporate executives say they are trying to persuade President Xi Jinping's government that a pattern of theft by the P.L.A. will damage China's growth prospects -- and the willingness of companies to invest in China -- their longer-term concern is that China may be trying to establish a new set of rules for Internet commerce, with more censorship and fewer penalties for the theft of intellectual property. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google, said Friday that while there was evidence that inside China many citizens are using the Web to pressure the government to clean up industrial hazards or to complain about corruption, ''so far there is no positive data on China's dealings with the rest of the world'' on cyberissues. Google largely pulled out of China after repeated attacks on its systems in 2009 and 2010, and now has its Chinese operations in Hong Kong. But it remains, Mr. Schmidt said, a constant target for Chinese cyberattackers. "
Wall Street's Exposure To Hacking Laid Bare,"The indictment on Thursday of a long-running hacking ring is kindling fears that rogue programmers are going beyond theft and developing the capacity to wreak havoc on the broader financial system. Five Eastern European computer programmers were charged by the United States attorney in New Jersey with hacking into the servers of more than a dozen large American companies and stealing 160 million credit card numbers in what the authorities called the largest hacking and data breach case ever. But one company had nothing to do with credit cards or bank accounts: Nasdaq.  In a separate indictment unsealed in federal court in New York, one of the men, Aleksandr Kalinin of Russia, was charged with having gained access for two years to the servers of the Nasdaq stock exchange. While Mr. Kalinin never penetrated the main servers supporting Nasdaq's trading operations -- and appears to have caused limited damage at Nasdaq -- the attack raised the prospect that hackers could be getting closer to the infrastructure that supports billions of dollars of trades each hour. ''As today's allegations make clear, cybercriminals are determined to prey not only on individual bank accounts, but on the financial system itself,'' Preet Bharara, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, said in announcing the case. It is a pivotal moment, just a week after a report from the World Federation of Exchanges and an international group of regulators warned about the vulnerability of exchanges to cybercrime. The report said that hackers were shifting their focus away from stealing money and toward more ''destabilizing aims.'' In a survey conducted for the report, 89 percent of the world's exchanges said that hacking posed a ''systemic risk'' to global financial markets. ''A presumption of safety (despite the reach and size of the threat) could open securities markets to a cyber 'black swan' event,'' the report said. At a Senate hearing on cybersecurity on Thursday, a representative of several financial industry groups, Mark Clancy, said that ''for the financial services industry, cyberthreats are a constant reality and a potential systemic risk to the industry.'' Over the last few years, accidental technological mishaps at the trading firm Knight Capital and the Nasdaq and BATS stock exchanges have revealed how even isolated programming errors can quickly ripple through the markets, causing significant losses in minutes. The exchanges have been bolstering their defenses and their preparations for an assault on their computer systems. On July 18, an industry group led an exercise, referred to as Quantum Dawn 2, in which the exchanges and other financial firms responded to a simulated attack on the nation's stock markets. The attack on Nasdaq is far from the first time an exchange has been singled out by hackers. In a survey conducted for the World Federation of Exchanges report, 53 percent of all exchanges said they had experienced a cyberattack during the last year. This year, the Prague Stock Exchange and several Czech banks were reportedly disabled for a brief time by an attack. The public-facing Web sites of a number of American exchanges have been hacked. Just last week, Nasdaq said that hackers had gained access to the passwords of people using one of its online forums. Its sites were breached in October 2010, too. At the time, the exchange said the breach affected a single system, known as Directors Desk, used by company board members to exchange confidential information. The indictments unsealed on Thursday indicate a more wide-ranging scheme that prosecutors say gave Mr. Kalinin and his accomplices access to an unknown amount of information on numerous Nasdaq servers. They were able to ''execute commands on those servers, including commands to delete, change or steal data,'' according to the indictment in Manhattan court. At certain points they had enough information to ''perform network or systems administrator functions'' on the servers, the New Jersey indictment said. Mr. Kalinin had access to the servers, intermittently, until October 2010, according to the Manhattan indictment. Nasdaq discovered the breach itself and alerted the authorities, according to a person briefed on the investigation. A spokesman for Nasdaq said the company had no comment on the case. Paul M. Tiao, a former senior adviser on cybersecurity at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said the Nasdaq breach was worrying because the servers the defendants attacked could have eventually provided an entryway to the more closely guarded trading systems. ''This is the beginning of the process through which you can imagine that some bad actors would find their way into much more sensitive infrastructure,'' said Mr. Tiao, now a partner at the law firm Hunton & Williams. ''This is a significant cause for concern.'' The indictment from the United States attorney in New Jersey, which included information on the Nasdaq breach, said that Mr. Kalinin, who went by the nicknames Grig and Tempo, first cracked Nasdaq's systems in late 2007 using so-called SQL injections. This technique infects a computer system with malicious software that in turn allows the attackers to steal or manipulate the contents of the system. When an accomplice in Florida asked about attacking Nasdaq, Mr. Kalinin wrote on instant message: ''NASDAQ is owned.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
U.S. Says Ring Stole 160 Million Credit Card Numbers,"Updated, 8:40 p.m. |  A prolific gang of foreign hackers stole and sold 160 million credit card numbers from more than a dozen companies, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, federal prosecutors charged on Thursday in what they described as the largest hacking and data breach case in the country. The scheme was run by four Russian nationals and a Ukrainian, said the United States attorney for the District of New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, who announced the indictments in Newark.   The victims in the scheme, which prosecutors said ran from 2005 until last year, included J. C. Penney; 7-Eleven; JetBlue; Heartland Payment Systems, one of the world's largest credit and debit processing companies; and the French retailer Carrefour. Separate indictments involving some of the same men, accusing them of computer attacks on Citibank, PNC Bank and the Nasdaq stock exchange, were filed by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Computer security experts said the scheme was notable for how long it lasted, how well coordinated it was and how it carefully singled out specific systems in the financial companies' servers to steal from so many personal credit and debit card accounts. The attackers had a sophisticated division of labor, according to the indictment. One hosted an anonymous Web server. Others broke into the targeted sites. Still another went inside and fetched the items of interest. The tactic is a signature of Russian organized crime syndicates. ""It is a really potent reminder of what researchers have been saying: The bigger threat is coming from criminal gangs, most of which are coming from Russia,"" said Fred H. Cate, director of the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research at Indiana University in Bloomington. ""It's far more immediately impactful than threats coming from China."" The defendants were identified as Vladimir Drinkman, Aleksandr Kalinin, Roman Kotov and Dmitriy Smilianets of Russia and Mikhail Rytikov of Ukraine. Mr. Smilianets and Mr. Drinkman were arrested in the Netherlands last year. Mr. Smilianets has already been extradited to the United States, where he is expected to make his first court appearance next week. The other three are at large. The defendants would use so-called SQL injections, which send a command or piece of code to a computer allowing unauthorized users to manipulate contents of the computer system. Once they gained access to credit card numbers, some of the men would sell them to resellers. ""They were very patient and relentless,"" Mr. Fishman said at a news conference on Thursday. When the men's attack on the supermarket chain Hannaford was noticed, a Florida man who worked with the defendants wrote in an instant message to Mr. Kalinin that ""Hannaford will spend millions to upgrade their security!! lol,"" according to the indictment. Mr. Kalinin reportedly wrote back, ""They would better pay us to not hack them again."" The defendants were generally able to sell American credit card numbers for $10 and European numbers for $50 because of the poorer security safeguards on American cards, Mr. Fishman said. Mr. Fishman said Heartland Payment Systems had suffered the biggest losses identified so far, about $200 million. Heartland said in a statement that its breach ended in 2008 and that it would ""continue supporting"" law enforcement organizations. In the indictment unsealed in Manhattan, Mr. Kalinin and another Russian, Nikolay Nasenkov, who is also at large, are accused of conducting a scheme to steal bank account information and use it to withdraw millions of dollars from the victims' bank accounts. From December 2005 through November 2008, the two men hacked into computer systems and stole information from banks including Citibank and PNC Bank, according to the indictment. The cases are likely to buttress the arguments of those pushing for federal laws to promote greater sharing of information between private companies and law enforcement agencies. Legislation has been proposed - and defeated - largely on the grounds that it would empower federal law enforcement authorities to snoop on private communications. An earlier version of the correction for an article about the federal indictments of foreign hackers misspelled the term that describes the hacking method. It is SQL injection, not SLQ. An article on Friday about the federal indictments of foreign hackers who stole and sold 160 million credit card numbers described their hacking method, an SQL injection, incorrectly. The maneuver involves sending a command or piece of code to a computer that allows unauthorized users to manipulate its contents; it is not software.  "
Data Security Begins With the Traveler,"E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com MY wife looked up from her iPad, where she was routinely reviewing a credit card statement. ''You're going to Bogotá?'' she asked. ''Not that I know of,'' I replied. ''So I'm guessing you also didn't buy a $10 cup of coffee yesterday in Antelope, California?'' she asked. No. The charge of $740.04, for a one-way ticket on Delta Air Lines to Bogotá, Colombia, and the charge for $10.20 at a coffee shop were fraudulent.  We are vigilant in our house about monitoring credit card activity, especially after traveling, and this was not the first time that unauthorized charges had appeared after recent trips. So I immediately got on the phone and reported the problem to the American Express Platinum Card office. The card was invalidated, a fraud investigation was begun, the charges were removed, and a few days later a new card arrived via FedEx. Then I called my friend the security expert, Anthony C. Roman, and said, problem solved, right? Not exactly. ''Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!'' he responded. What's the big deal? Aside from the inconvenience of having to enter the new credit card information on recurring accounts, the cost to me was zero. ''Well, hopefully it was,'' said Mr. Roman, president of Roman & Associates, which specializes in investigations and risk management consulting. He explained, however, that isolated unauthorized charges on your credit card statement most likely indicate that sophisticated cybercriminals are waiting to see if you will notice. ''What credit card fraudsters do is test your vigilance, how carefully you're watching your account, and how carefully the credit card providers are watching your account. They do this by making relatively small purchases first, to see if it sets off any bells and whistles,'' he said. Many frequent travelers are lax about checking activity statements in a timely manner, which flashes a green light to criminal hackers. Then, he said, ''Hell or high water, the big charges are coming.'' Worse, he said, a hacked card could indicate that more serious identity theft might have occurred. In its 2013 Global Security Report, Trustwave, a data security management firm, says that the top three industries targeted for data breach attacks in 2012, measured by the number of its investigations, were retailing (45 percent), food and beverage (24 percent) and hotels (9 percent). Three years ago, the hotel industry was at the top, but hotels have since made ''significant strides'' in improving credit card security measures, the report says. Still, criminal hackers gravitate to some hotels because, like retail stores and restaurants, hotels do many credit card transactions at a local level, where centralized and highly sophisticated data security safeguards may be lacking. Last year, for example, the Federal Trade Commission sued Wyndham Worldwide, the hotel chain, for what it said was inadequate safeguarding of credit card information that led to three data breaches at hotels in under two years, with ''millions of dollars in fraud loss, and the export of hundreds of thousands of consumers' payment card account information to an Internet domain address registered in Russia.'' Wyndham responded that it had done all it could to report the crimes and carry out ''significant remedial measures.'' The company also charged that the commission had overstepped both its authority and its expertise in hotel data security enforcement. Most hotels are locally owned, though managed by big hotel chain companies. For hotel owners, it is expensive to come into full compliance with the tough global data security criteria set by the credit card companies. And, Trustwave says, ''Cybersecurity threats are increasing as quickly as businesses can implement measures against them.'' The threat is constant, Mr. Roman said. ''The best protection is vigilance, and that takes work,'' he said. That includes using complex passwords, being wary of public Wi-Fi, updating antivirus software -- and checking credit card statements carefully. Speaking of work, I hate to memorize passwords and PINs, but that appears to lie ahead. In the United States, credit cards use magnetic strips that are more vulnerable to hacking than the electronic chips embedded in credit cards in Europe and elsewhere. Such cards also require entry of a PIN. These so-called chip-and-PIN cards are headed our way, said Kathy Orner, vice president for information security at Carlson Rezidor, a worldwide hotel company that is among the industry leaders in data security. All of the major credit card issuers plan to start introducing these cards in the United States within two or three years. Ms. Orner had some advice for when that happens. ''Do not use the same PIN on your credit card that you use on your debit card'' or anywhere else, she said. Right: more numbers to remember, coming soon. "
Bolstering a Phone's Defenses,"SAN FRANCISCO -- From Lookout's headquarters here, the view extends west from the Bay Bridge to the Golden Gate, but its employees -- mostly 20-something engineers in T-shirts and jeans -- seem too preoccupied with the world's nastiest new threats to take it in. Lookout's employees are busy tracking the cybercriminals and aggressive advertisers that target the 45 million people around the globe who have downloaded the company's free mobile security app. That is Step 1 to a more lucrative goal: protecting the data of big, corporate customers that are allowing employees to use their own mobile devices on corporate networks. The so-called bring your own device, or B.Y.O.D., trend can lead to trouble. Last year, for example, Jackson North Medical Center in North Miami Beach, Fla., banned personal smartphones after a volunteer used his phone's camera to take about 1,100 photos of patient records, including their Social Security numbers, and sold them.  Such episodes are not that unusual. Almost half of companies that allow personally owned devices to connect to the corporate network have experienced a data breach, either because of unwitting mistakes by employees or -- as was the case at the Florida hospital -- intentional wrongdoing, according to a 2012 survey of 400 technology professionals by researchers at Decisive Analytics. ''It's amazing that at power plants workers are required to wear hard hats and steel-toed shoes, but then you have engineers plugging their mobile devices right into the network,'' said Jerry Dixon, the former director of the cyber division at the Department of Homeland Security. ''What could possibly go wrong?'' With that risk in mind, Lookout is taking aim at companies and government agencies in much the same way attackers are: it is using its app to slip under the door of enterprises via the hundreds of millions of employees who regularly bring their personal devices to work. Lookout is among a handful of tech companies trying to capitalize on the B.Y.O.D. phenomenon that people in charge of securing corporate networks say has become their biggest headache. In the past, they could mandate that employees use company-approved BlackBerry smartphones, which came with a tightly controlled network. But with BlackBerry's future uncertain -- the company was clinging to 2.9 percent of the global smartphone market last quarter, according to the research firm IDC -- and consumers clamoring to use their iPhones, iPads and Android-powered devices at work, tech managers have had to consider alternatives and deal with the potential security threats that come with those alternatives. Twice as many corporate employees use their own iPhones, iPads and Android devices at work than use corporate-approved devices, according to Osterman Research. Even the Internal Revenue Service, one of the slower technology adopters, recently introduced wireless access and is considering letting employees B.Y.O.D. ''The B.Y.O.D. train has left the station, not just for employees but for business partners and vendors who all have access to sensitive data from their devices,'' said Craig Shumard, the former chief information security officer at Cigna Corporation, the large health insurer. ''BlackBerry was the de facto standard, but now my peers are getting pressured to open it up and allow employees to do their business on any device.'' Most B.Y.O.D. antidotes are geared toward mobile data management. Companies like Good Technology, MobileIron, AirWatch and Citrix's XenMobile help managers segregate corporate data from personal data on employees' phones and offer features that help them remotely wipe proprietary information from a device if it gets lost or stolen. Symantec and Intel's McAfee, the behemoths of the computer security business, have developed similar capabilities by acquiring mobile-focused start-ups. Lookout approached the problem from a different direction, said Nushin Vaiani, a security analyst at Canalys, a market research company. It used a consumer app to increase the number of devices it can monitor and to gain better brand visibility. The Lookout app -- which backs up data, tells users if other apps are siphoning their information, locates lost or stolen phones and even e-mails users a snapshot of the thief if he fails to guess their passcode -- has grown in use by a factor of 200 over the last three years. Today, those tens of millions of devices act as global sensors, feeding all sorts of hairy threats back to Lookout's Mobile Threat Network, a vast data set on a cloud of servers that tracks and analyzes malicious activity and helps researchers anticipate criminals' next moves. Nearly half of employees at companies in the Fortune 1000 run Lookout, which made its next move almost inevitable. Last month, the company announced Lookout for Business, which is meant to help businesses manage and secure employees' mobile devices, whether or not they are company-issued. The app will block malware, spyware and adware on those devices and give corporations, and its own customers, a clearer window into a new breed of mobile threats. ''Now they've reached the point where they have enough substantial users, that they can then think about how to expand their solution into the business environment,'' Ms. Vaiani said. The potential has investors salivating. In addition to the $76 million that Lookout has already raised, the company received $55 million this month from Deutsche Telekom, Qualcomm Ventures, Greylock Partners and Peter Thiel's venture firm Mithril Capital Management. The investment round valued Lookout at roughly $1 billion. Lookout's founders, John Hering, 30, Kevin Mahaffey, 28, and James Burgess, 30, say that in the future, they plan to move beyond mobile phones and tablets to cars, thermostats and any and all of the billions of so-called smart devices now coming online. There is little doubt that data security managers are struggling to keep tabs on sensitive information as employees start importing data to their personal devices, inevitably lose them and download mobile apps that have access to corporate assets. Experts and threat researchers warn that these applications have little or no safeguards. Gartner, a research company, predicts that by 2015, 75 percent of mobile applications will fail basic security tests. Already, Scott Borg, the director and chief economist at the nonprofit group United States Cyber Consequences Unit, said businesses and government agencies were finding that employees' mobile devices had become a crucial way for attackers to reach a network. ''An enormous amount of applications out there have been Trojanized,'' Mr. Borg said, referring to apps that criminals have tampered with. ''They have become one of the main steppingstones for getting into the enterprise.'' A Lookout threat report this year said a tiny but growing portion of its Android user base in the United States -- half a percentage point -- had unwittingly downloaded mobile Trojans. And 1.6 percent have downloaded adware that pilfers their personal data without their knowledge. Mr. Borg said companies and agencies were discovering that the information collected from mobile Trojans was the first step in ''spearphishing'' campaigns, in which criminals use that data to tailor e-mails to employees with malicious links or attachments that, once clicked, give attackers a foothold into companies' systems. That threat, Joseph Ansanelli, a partner at Greylock, said, particularly on Android, has prevented tech managers from deploying Android devices in their companies. But Lookout has teamed up with three of the four major carriers that offer Android in the United States, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. It has also set up strategic partnerships with Deutsche Telekom in Germany and Orange in France and now comes preloaded on T-Mobile and Sprint devices. ''In the P.C. era, the world only became less secure,'' Mr. Hering of Lookout said. ''The goal is to make it more secure as it gets more connected.'' "
Someone Hacked N.H.T.S.A.'s Servers,"As it turns out, even highway safety regulators are vulnerable to the ravaging hand of cybercriminals. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had some of its servers hacked last week, the agency confirmed on Tuesday.  The 10 servers involved are used for reports from automakers about their plans for recalls, as well as for progress reports on continuing and past investigations. Normally, the information stored on the affected servers is public and can be located along with other information on recalls or defect investigations. But on Friday, the usually public documents became inaccessible. The blockage was caused by an alert about a ""cybersecurity incident"" from the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, an agency spokesman wrote in an e-mailed statement. The statement said that the episode ""was limited in scope, involved systems which host publicly available information"" and that no personal or confidential business information had been compromised. The 10 servers that were attacked are no longer connected to the Internet, the agency said, and ""countermeasures to return all equipment to normal operation"" were under way. It wasn't clear when the documents would be available again, and an agency spokesman declined to answer questions regarding the source of the attack.  "
Daily Report: Data Theft at Target the Latest Salvo in a Long War," Target may have been an easy bull's-eye for criminal hackers intent on stealing credit card information, but the theft of records for 40 million store customers was hardly the worst security breach among big retailers in recent years. And the incident revealed on Thursday is unlikely to be the last, Nicole Perlroth reports.  Security experts say the Target hack is a reminder of security problems facing many retailers that won't easily go away: There are weaknesses in the way payment information travels between retailers and banks. There is plenty of money to be made on the black market selling stolen credit card numbers, which can go for as little as a quarter or as much as $45 each. And American companies have been reluctant to adopt smart-chip cards, a type of credit card widely used in Europe that provides better security. Target said that from Nov. 27 to Dec. 15 hackers stole customer names, credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates and three-digit security codes for 40 million customers who had shopped in its stores. It is currently working with a forensic team from Verizon to investigate the breach, according to one person involved in the inquiry. But there was no word as to who was behind the attack, how they got in, or what the total cost to Target may be. Thursday, visitors to the retailer's website found a site festooned in red and green save for a stark black-and-white security notice at the top. Complicating matters, Target was hit during the holiday shopping season, when fraud detection systems have a hard enough time telling legitimate transactions from fake ones. Read more »  "
Privacy Flaw in Path's iPhone App Shares Location Data," 4:59 p.m. | Updated  Adding comment from a Path employee.   Path, a social media start-up company, has to pay $800,000 in damages for privacy violations, the Federal Trade Commission said on Friday. But this may not be the end of Path's troubles with privacy. A security researcher has pointed out a loophole that allows Path to share location data even when a user has turned off location sharing.  Jeffrey Paul, a data security consultant, on Friday published a blog post pointing out a security flaw in Path for iPhone users. If a user posts a photo inside Path and writes a caption, the app can still share the city or other general location where the photo was taken - even if a user has turned off location sharing for Path in the iPhone's privacy settings. A quick test confirmed this loophole. The location information is shared through a photo caption if a user has decided to allow the iPhone camera to tag photos with location information. Mr. Paul said in an interview that if a user has asked that his location data not be shared through Path, Path should remove the photo's location information before publishing it so the location is not shared. Twitter does this when a user requests that his location not be shared, Mr. Paul said. Mr. Paul said he discovered this privacy leak unintentionally when he posted a photo on Path. ""It painted a picture to me of the company as being people that aren't interested in taking the correct steps to safeguard their user information,"" he said in an interview. Path did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment. When reached, Apple's public relations department had not yet prepared a comment. Dylan Casey, a product manager at Path, posted a comment on Mr. Paul's blog. He said the company was unaware of the privacy flaw and had issued a new version of the app to Apple that fixes the problem. Path came under scrutiny last February when a programmer discovered that its app was surreptitiously copying address book information from users' iPhones without notifying them. The F.T.C. later filed a complaint that said Path's app was misleading and did not give consumers a choice regarding the collection of their personal information.  "
"Cyberattacks Seem Meant to Destroy, Not Just Disrupt","American Express customers trying to gain access to their online accounts Thursday were met with blank screens or an ominous ancient type face. The company confirmed that its Web site had come under attack. The assault, which took American Express offline for two hours, was the latest in an intensifying campaign of unusually powerful attacks on American financial institutions that began last September and have taken dozens of them offline intermittently, costing millions of dollars. JPMorgan Chase was taken offline by a similar attack this month. And last week, a separate, aggressive attack incapacitated 32,000 computers at South Korea's banks and television networks. The culprits of these attacks, officials and experts say, appear intent on disabling financial transactions and operations.  Corporate leaders have long feared online attacks aimed at financial fraud or economic espionage, but now a new threat has taken hold: attackers, possibly with state backing, who seem bent on destruction. ''The attacks have changed from espionage to destruction,'' said Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a cybersecurity training organization. ''Nations are actively testing how far they can go before we will respond.'' Security experts who studied the attacks said that it was part of the same campaign that took down the Web sites of JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and others over the last six months. A group that calls itself the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has claimed responsibility for those attacks. The group says it is retaliating for an anti-Islamic video posted on YouTube last fall. But American intelligence officials and industry investigators say they believe the group is a convenient cover for Iran. Just how tight the connection is -- or whether the group is acting on direct orders from the Iranian government -- is unclear. Government officials and bank executives have failed to produce a smoking gun. North Korea is considered the most likely source of the attacks on South Korea, though investigators are struggling to follow the digital trail, a process that could take months. The North Korean government of Kim Jong-un has openly declared that it is seeking online targets in its neighbor to the south to exact economic damage. Representatives of American Express confirmed that the company was under attack Thursday, but said that there was no evidence that customer data had been compromised. A representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation did not respond to a request for comment on the American Express attack. Spokesmen for JPMorgan Chase said they would not talk about the recent attack there, its origins or its consequences. JPMorgan has openly acknowledged previous denial of service attacks. But the size and severity of the most recent one apparently led it to reconsider. The Obama administration has publicly urged companies to be more transparent about attacks, but often security experts and lawyers give the opposite advice. The largest contingent of instigators of attacks in the private sector, government officials and researchers say, remains Chinese hackers intent on stealing corporate secrets. The American and South Korean attacks underscore a growing fear that the two countries most worrisome to banks, oil producers and governments may be Iran and North Korea, not because of their skill but because of their brazenness. Neither country is considered a superstar in this area. The appeal of digital weapons is similar to that of nuclear capability: it is a way for an outgunned, outfinanced nation to even the playing field. ''These countries are pursuing cyberweapons the same way they are pursuing nuclear weapons,'' said James A. Lewis, a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''It's primitive; it's not top of the line, but it's good enough and they are committed to getting it.'' American officials are currently weighing their response options, but the issues involved are complex. At a meeting of banking executives, regulators and representatives from the departments of Homeland Security and Treasury last December, some pressed the United States to hit back at the hackers, while others argued that doing so would only lead to more aggressive attacks, according to two people who attended the meeting. The difficulty of deterring such attacks was also the focus of a White House meeting this month with Mr. Obama and business leaders, including the chief executives Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America; Rex W. Tillerson of Exxon Mobil; Randall L. Stephenson of AT&T and others. Mr. Obama's goal was to erode the business community's intense opposition to federal legislation that would give the government oversight of how companies protect ''critical infrastructure,'' like banking systems and energy and cellphone networks. That opposition killed a bill last year, prompting Mr. Obama to sign an executive order promoting increased information-sharing with businesses. ''But I think we heard a new tone at this latest meeting,'' an Obama aide said later. ''Six months of unrelenting attacks have changed some views.'' Mr. Lewis, the computer security expert, agreed. ''The Iranian attacks have tilted private sector opinion,'' he said. ''Hence the muted reaction to the executive order versus squeals of outrage. Companies are much more concerned about this and much more willing to see a government role.'' Neither Iran nor North Korea has shown anywhere near the subtlety and technique in online offensive skills that the United States and Israel demonstrated with Olympic Games, the ostensible effort to disable Iran's nuclear enrichment plants with an online weapon that destabilized hundreds of centrifuges, destroying many of them. But after descriptions of that operation became public in the summer of 2010, Iran announced the creation of its own Cyber Corps. North Korea has had hackers for years, some of whom are believed to be operating from, or through, China. Neither North Korea nor Iran is as focused on stealing data as they are determined to destroy it, experts contend. When hackers believed by American intelligence officials to be Iranians hit the world's largest oil producer, Saudi Aramco, last year, they did not just erase data on 30,000 Aramco computers; they replaced the data with an image of a burning American flag. In the assault on South Korea last week, some affected computers displayed an ominous image of skulls. ''This attack is as much a cyber-rampage as it is a cyberattack,'' Rob Rachwald, a research director at FireEye, a computer security firm, said of the South Korea attacks. In the past, such assaults typically occurred through a denial-of-service attack, in which hackers flood their target with Web traffic from networks of infected computers until it is overwhelmed and shuts down. One such case was a 2007 Russian attack on Estonia that affected its banks, the Parliament, ministries, newspapers and broadcasters. With their campaign against American financial institutions, the hackers suspected of being Iranian have taken that kind of attack to the next level. Instead of using individual personal computers to fire Web traffic at each bank, they infected powerful, commercial data centers with sophisticated malware and directed them to simultaneously fire at each bank, giving them the horsepower to inflict a huge attack. As a result, the hackers were able to take down the consumer banking sites of American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other banks with exponentially more traffic than hit Estonia in 2007. In the attack on Saudi Aramco last year, the culprits did not mount that type of assault. Instead, they created malware designed for the greatest impact, coded to spread to as many computers as possible. Likewise, the attacks last week on South Korean banks and broadcasters were far more sophisticated than coordinated denial-of-service attacks in 2009 that briefly took down the Web sites of South Korea's president and its Defense Ministry. Such attacks were annoyances; they largely did not affect operations. This time around in South Korea, however, the attackers engineered malware that could evade popular South Korean antivirus products, spread it to as many computer systems as possible, and inserted a ''time bomb'' to take out all the systems at once for greatest impact. The biggest concern, Mr. Lewis said: ''We don't know how they make decisions. When you add erratic decision making, then you really have something to worry about.'' "
American Banks' Sites Are Attacked By Hackers,"For the last week, hackers have - once again - attacked the online banking sites of several American banks. The attacks appear to be the second stage of a campaign that began in September, when a hacker group calling itself Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters took credit for a series of attacks on the Web sites of Bank of America, Citigroup, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo and PNC that caused intermittent delays. The group said it had attacked the banks in retaliation for an anti-Islam video that mocked the Prophet Muhammad and pledged to continue its campaign until the video was removed from the Internet. They called the campaign Operation Ababil, a Koran reference to the swallows Allah sent to attack an army of elephants dispatched by the King of Yemen to attack Mecca in 571 A.D.  In an online post on Tuesday, the group said that it had resumed Operation Ababil and that, over the last several weeks, it had focused on nine banks: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, BB&T, Suntrust and Regions Financial. ""Our aim of this operation is removal of that insulting and absurd film,"" the hackers wrote in an online post. Of the nine banks, representatives of PNC, BB&T and Citigroup confirmed that their online banking sites had experienced intermittent disruptions because of a high volume of Web traffic, but they said that bank accounts and customer information had not been affected. Though they were not mentioned in the group's online hit list, Capital One and Fifth Third Bank also experienced brief disruptions. Customers at Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and JPMorgan did not appear to have had any trouble reaching their accounts. In an e-mail to customers, PNC said it had experienced ""an unusually high volume of traffic"" to its site. ""This volume of traffic is consistent with threatened cyberattacks on the U.S. banking system and is designed to cause access delays for legitimate Internet customers,"" the statement said. Debra DeCourcy, a spokeswoman for Fifth Third Bank, said that from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Thursday, Fifth Third also had a high volume of traffic to its site. ""We believe it was a denial of service attack designed to disrupt access to our site,"" Ms. DeCourcy said. ""This was an access issue, not a security issue: No customer information or data was compromised."" In a denial of service attack, hackers bombard a site with traffic until it collapses under the load. Though banks take great pains to absorb large volumes of traffic, many experienced unprecedented levels. Typically such attacks are deployed through a Web application, in which hackers recruit volunteers to click on a link that sends signals from their computers to a victim's site, or through botnets, networks of infected computers and devices that do hackers' work for them. But security researchers who studied the attacks on banking sites last fall said hackers had used a new weapon: data centers. Researchers at Radware who investigated the attacks for several banks found that the traffic was coming from data centers around the world that had been infected with a sophisticated form of malware that was designed to evade detection by antivirus solutions. The attackers used those infected servers to simultaneously fire traffic at each banking site until it slowed or collapsed. By infecting data centers instead of computers, attackers obtained the horsepower to mount an enormous denial of service attack. Jenny Shearer, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, declined to comment on the source of the attacks on Friday. In an online post, hackers said the attacks had not been sponsored by a country. Government and intelligence officials have blamed Iran for the fall attacks and for a destructive cyberattack on computers at Saudi Aramco in August, though they have not presented any evidence to back up their claims. Tracing cyberattacks back to one particular country is difficult, security experts say, because traffic can be routed through different Internet addresses to mask their true origin. Security researchers still do not know how the data centers used in the first wave of attacks were infected in the first place, how widespread the infection rate was and - perhaps most troubling - whether the servers could be used to damage other sensitive targets in the future. On Tuesday, the hackers said they had no intention of halting their campaign. ""Officials of American banks must expect our massive attacks,"" they wrote. ""From now on, none of the U.S. banks will be safe."" This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
China's Cybergames,"Washington has not had much success persuading Beijing to rein in its hackers even though American officials and security experts have long known that China is the main source of cyberattacks on the United States. Two recent developments, however, should raise the political costs for China and may cause it to alter its calculus. Refusal to change its conduct could make its relations with the United States even more difficult than they are. On Tuesday, a new report from Mandiant, an American computer security firm, publicly documented an explicit link between Chinese hackers and the People's Liberation Army. The report cites a growing body of digital forensic evidence that most of the attacks on American corporations, organizations and government agencies originate in and around a 12-story office tower on the outskirts of Shanghai that is the headquarters of P.L.A. Unit 61398.  Mandiant tracked individual members of the most sophisticated of the Chinese hacking groups, known as ''Comment Crew'' or ''Shanghai Group,'' to the headquarters of the military unit, which is central to China's computer espionage operations. It followed ''Comment Crew'' for six years, monitoring 141 attacks by looking at Web domains, malware, Internet protocol addresses and embedded codes. Reporters for The Times confirmed the evidence contained in the report with American intelligence officials who say they have tapped into the activity of the army unit for years. Chinese officials denounced the report, but their reaction was hardly a denial. ''Hacking attacks are transnational and anonymous. Determining their origins are extremely difficult. We don't know how the evidence in this so-called report can be tenable,'' said Hong Lei, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. In a second development that could further raise the stakes for Beijing, Washington decided to share with American Internet providers and antivirus vendors information about the unique signatures of the largest of the Chinese groups, including those originating from the area where Unit 61398 is based. The government warnings will not link the hackers and their computers to the Chinese Army per se, but the effects will be felt when the hackers and computers are denied access to American networks, as many of the Internet providers and antivirus vendors are expected to do. American officials are increasingly concerned about cyberattacks intended not just to steal corporate secrets but also, as President Obama said in his recent State of the Union address, to ''sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air traffic control systems.'' As a defensive measure, Mr. Obama last week signed an executive order promoting increased information-sharing about cyberthreats between the government and private companies that oversee the country's critical infrastructure, including its electrical power grid, gas lines and waterworks. Congress still has not acted on legislation setting minimum requirements for how this infrastructure should be protected. A reasonably strong bill offered in the Senate last summer has been stymied by objections from some legislators that it would be too intrusive. So far, Mr. Obama has chosen not to have a public collision with China. He and his aides have largely raised their concerns in private. But patience is wearing thin as China-emanated attacks have grown and the administration pursues a more aggressive response. China and the United States have to cooperate on numerous international security issues. But that won't happen if they end up in a cyberwar. Publicizing China's transgressions and blocking Internet access to hackers should be a warning to Beijing. Washington is right to defend its interests. But the two nations need to take the lead in negotiating new international understandings about what constitutes cyberaggression and how governments should respond. "
Staying Safe From Java Threats,"Q. I hear lots of scary stuff about hackers getting into computers thru Java. What do I need to do to make my Mac and PC safe? Any worries about tablets?  A. Java is a computing platform with its own programming language that is used in many games, business applications and other utilities. It runs on more than 850 million computers worldwide and is used often by Web browsers. Recent attacks on Apple and Facebook used a flaw in the Java Web browser plug-in to infect computers with malicious software when visiting certain sites, and the Department of Homeland Security even issued a warning about Java back in January. Computers running Windows, Mac OS X and Linux are most at risk. Tablets running systems like Android and iOS are not generally affected; mobile browsers have a setting for the JavaScript programming language, but JavaScript is basically unrelated to Java and its not subject to the current malware issues. Disabling Java in your Web browser should protect your computer from the recent types of security threats, although you may not be able to play certain games or use Java-dependent applications. Oracle, which develops Java, has instructions for disabling Java in several browsers on Windows, Mac and Linux systems. Independent security sites, like Krebs on Security and Sophos, have additional information. Apple released its own Mac OS X update to deal with the Java problem on Feb. 19, and the Macworld site has an article on going beyond the browser plug-in and removing Java altogether. Oracle has instructions for uninstalling Java completely on a Windows system, as well as on a Mac. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to QandA @nytimes.com.

"Where Apps Meet Work, Secret Data Is at Risk","SAN FRANCISCO -- As is the case with many busy people, Delyn Simons's life has become an open phone app of commingled corporate and personal information. ''I've got Dropbox, Box, YouSendIt, Teambox, Google Drive,'' says Ms. Simons, a 42-year-old executive, naming just five of the many services on her iPhone to store memos, spreadsheets, customer information and soccer schedules. She and her colleagues at Mashery, a 170-employee company that helps other companies build even more apps, also share corporate data on GroupMe, Evernote, Skype and Google Hangouts. ''From the standpoint of corporate I.T.,'' she says, ''my team is a problem.''  And how. ''My peers are killing me,'' says John Oberon, Mashery's information technology chief, who is supposed to keep track of company data. While the company's most confidential information is encrypted and available only to authorized executives, he said, ''there's only so much you can do to stop people from forwarding an e-mail or storing a document off a phone.'' Chinese hackers are one problem. But so are employees who put company information online with their smartphones and tablets. Once the data leaves the corporate network, protecting it becomes much harder. Searching for the name of almost any large company, plus the word ''confidential,'' yields supposedly secret documents that someone has taken from the company network and published. Netflix, the streaming video service, recently found employees using 496 smartphone apps, primarily for data storage, communications and collaboration. Cisco Systems, which powers much of the Internet with computer networking gear, found several hundred apps, as well as services for shopping and personal scheduling, touching its own network via employees. ''People are going to bring their own devices, their own data, their own software applications, even their own work groups,'' drawing off friends and contractors at other companies, said Bill Burns, the director of information technology infrastructure at Netflix. ''If you try and implant software that limits an employee's capabilities, you're adding a layer of complexity.'' Almost no service is invulnerable. In 2011, Chinese hackers obtained access to hundreds of United States government accounts on Google's Gmail. Last July, Dropbox, one of the most widely used storage services, reported a loss of data from a large number of customers. Without special instructions, customer sales information in the online service of Salesforce.com can be moved to private accounts at Box. On Saturday, Evernote said user names, e-mail address and encrypted passwords had been stolen in an attack, requiring the passwords of more than 50 million accounts to be reset. In 2011, Juniper Networks found more than 28,000 samples of mobile malware, mostly for capturing and transferring information like passwords. In January this year, Florida's Juvenile Justice Department reported that 114,538 youth and employee records had disappeared when a mobile storage device with no password was stolen. The state will pay for a year of credit monitoring for everyone whose data was lost. Last September, a customer notified Rite Aid that he could obtain other customers' names, addresses and prescription records from the company's mobile app. (Rite Aid says the problem has been fixed and that it is not aware of any data loss.) Even without proof of compromised accounts, such losses can cost a company both money and reputation. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, unauthorized disclosures of confidential information, whether from unsecured devices, leaky apps or poor cloud security, must be announced publicly if the information could affect a company's stock price. Some apps onto which employees may move company information, like Facebook and Amazon, are well known. Others, like Remember the Milk, used for completing tasks, or CloudElephant, a data backup service, are news even to some of the experts in I.T. Skyhigh Networks, which recently started monitoring personal use of apps, has counted more than 1,200 services used in corporate networks from personal devices. Skyhigh signs up for each service, along with 1,000 others that have not yet touched a corporate network, and researches them for security issues, like whether people can share data anonymously, or how easy it is to get inside the system and obtain another customer's data. The company then tunes a customer's corporate network to allow services to have different degrees of access to information. ''We have to be careful how we inspect for security vulnerabilities, since we don't want to get arrested ourselves,'' says Rajiv Gupta, the chief executive at Skyhigh. ''What makes an iPhone interesting and scary is what happens in the cloud, and how I can upload things with one device and then download them to another from someplace else.'' The problem of data leakage is as old as someone taking a carbon copy home on the weekend. What is different today is how people can take data with a finger swipe, and how little they know about whether a service has malware or how much it can see of what is going on elsewhere in a phone. Companies do not want to stand in the way of ''life splicing,'' as the intermingling of home and work tasks is known, because it mostly plays in a company's favor. They just want more security. Besides Skyhigh's catalogs and controls over different apps, a system called Websense allows companies to ensure that office access to LinkedIn is only for research on people and companies, not for job applications. Companies also know little about what ad hoc corporate computing really costs, as groups buy their own mobile work productivity apps or rent cloud computing and data storage from the likes of Amazon Web Services. ''The popular term now when people bypass the in-house organization is 'shadow I.T.,' '' says Sunny Gupta, chief executive of Apptio, which helps companies calculate their total corporate I.T. spending. If the spending is high enough, companies look for volume discounts on their unofficial computing. In a 2012 survey of information technology managers by PricewaterhouseCoopers, 47 percent of respondents said that at least half of corporate I.T. spending was now shadow I.T. "
Australian Central Bank Hit by Cyberattack,"SYDNEY -- The Australian central bank confirmed Monday that it had been hit by cyberattacks, but it said no data had been lost or systems compromised. The central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, was responding to a report in a newspaper, The Australian Financial Review, that said the central bank had been repeatedly and successfully hacked and information stolen. ''As reported in today's media, the bank has on occasion been the target of cyber attacks,'' the central bank said in a news release. ''The bank has comprehensive security arrangements in place which have isolated these attacks and ensured that viruses have not been spread across the bank's network or systems.  ''At no point have these attacks caused the bank's data or information to be lost or its systems to be corrupted.'' Hacking attacks on governments and corporations have become common, with analysts casting suspicion on China as the source of much of the activity. Beijing has repeatedly denied accusations that it is behind the attacks, saying it, too, is a victim of hacking, particularly from the United States. The Australian central bank said it routinely consulted with the Defense Signals Directorate, the Australian intelligence agency, to ensure the security of its systems. Reports released under the Australian Freedom of Information Act showed that the central bank had been the subject of a malicious e-mail attack Nov. 16 and 17, 2011, using a virus that was undetectable by the bank's anti-virus software. An e-mail titled ''Strategic Planning FY2012'' was sent to several members of the central bank's staff, in ranks as high as department head, and was opened by six of them, potentially compromising their workstations. The e-mail purported to come from a senior staff member at the bank and came from a ''possibly legitimate'' external account. The e-mails contained a compressed file with an executable ''malware,'' or malicious software, application, although the bank would not identify the virus used. None of the six workstations affected had local administrator rights, which prevented the virus from spreading. The servers were considered compromised and were removed from the network Nov. 17. ''The e-mail had managed to bypass the existing security controls in place for malicious e-mails by being well written, targeted to specific bank staff and utilized an embedded hyperlink to the virus payload which differs from the usual attack whereby the virus is attached directly to the e-mail,'' according the central bank's report on the incident. ''Bank assets could have been potentially compromised, leading to service disruption, information loss and reputation,'' the report noted. The bank took the issue to the providers of its anti-virus software to update its defenses, including scanning for hyperlinks in e-mails and automatically blocking them. As well as the attempted hacking, the central bank documents also listed a number of potentially embarrassing incidents, including lost laptops and BlackBerrys and the e-mailing of sensitive documents by mistake. In one incident, a folder containing confidential information was left on the back of an office car by a distracted staff member. When the staff member drove away, a passing motorist raised the alarm that papers had scattered across the road.Most of the papers were recovered after an hour of searching, although some were thought lost in a stormwater drain, ''resulting in moderate reputational risk to the bank,'' the report said. "
Attacks Used The Internet Against Itself To Clog Traffic,"An escalating cyberattack involving an antispam group and a shadowy group of attackers has now affected millions of people across the Internet, raising the question: How can such attacks be stopped? The short answer is: Not easily. The digital ''fire hose'' being wielded by the attackers to jam traffic on the Internet in recent weeks was made possible by both the best and worst aspects of the sprawling global computer network. The Internet is, by default, an open, loosely regulated platform for communication, but many of the servers that make its communication possible have been configured in such a way that they can be easily fooled. The latest attacks, which appeared to have subsided by Wednesday, have demonstrated just how big a problem that can be. On Tuesday, security engineers said that an anonymous group unhappy with Spamhaus, a volunteer organization that distributes a blacklist of spammers to e-mail providers, had retaliated with a cyberattack of vast proportions.  In what is called a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack, the assailants harnessed a powerful botnet -- a network of thousands of infected computers being controlled remotely -- to send attack traffic first to Spamhaus's Web site and later to the Internet servers used by CloudFlare, a Silicon Valley company that Spamhaus hired to deflect its onslaught. This kind of attack works because the botnet exploits Internet routing software and fools Internet servers into responding to requests for information sent simultaneously by a large group of computers. The Internet servers that answer the requests are tricked into sending blocks of data to the victims, in this case Spamhaus and CloudFlare. The attack was amplified because each of the servers in this case was asked to send a relatively large block of information. The data stream grew from 10 billion bits per second last week to as much as 300 billion bits per second this week, the largest such attack ever reported, causing what CloudFlare estimated to be hundreds of millions of people to experience delays and error messages across the Web. On Wednesday, CloudFlare described the highly technical game of cat-and-mouse between itself and Spamhaus's opponents that has played out over the course of the last nine days. After the attackers discovered that they could not disable CloudFlare, which had been hired by Spamhaus to absorb its attack traffic, they changed their strategy. They took aim at the networks that CloudFlare connected to and began to attack the computer servers that serve as the network's foundation. These are specialized ''peering'' points at which Internet networks exchange traffic. The attackers took aim at organizations like the London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Hong Kong Internet exchanges, which route regional Internet traffic and are also used by sites like Google, Facebook and Yahoo to pass traffic efficiently among one another. Here, too, they were unable to stall the Internet completely, but they did slow it, particularly by focusing on the London exchange, known as LINX. ''From our perspective, the attacks had the largest effect on LINX,'' said Matthew Prince, CloudFlare's chief executive, in a description posted on the company's Web site on Wednesday. For a little over an hour on Saturday, he said, the traffic passing through the LINX infrastructure dropped significantly. The attacks were episodic, stopping and starting and shifting targets over nine days through Tuesday morning. On Wednesday, Mr. Prince said that there some indications that the attackers were planning further actions, although he said he did not know if they would include DDoS attacks. Veteran Internet engineers said the attack was made possible by a combination of defects, loopholes and sloppy configuration of Internet routing equipment. Indeed, a number of computer security specialists pointed out that the attacks would have been impossible if the world's major Internet firms simply checked that outgoing data packets truly were being sent by their customers, rather than botnets. Unfortunately, a relatively small number of Internet companies actually perform this kind of check. The depth of the problem is illustrated by the fact that the basic principles for stopping such attacks have been widely recognized since at least 2000. That was the year that the Network Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force, a voluntary group of Internet and telecommunications engineers, laid out a set of ''best current practices'' that Internet companies and organizations were encouraged to follow to defeat a threat known as ''I.P. address spoofing,'' which is the ability for an attacker to hide behind a faked address that is crucial for denial-of-service attacks. But these basic Internet engineering ''rules of the road,'' laid out in a document known as BCP 38, are followed by a relatively small number of companies. ''They have just not been willing to invest the effort it would take to make things so much better,'' said Mark Seiden, a member of the Security and Stability Advisory Committee of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees the domain name system. The Internet security community recently started ''naming and shaming'' operators of these open, misconfigured servers -- called open resolvers -- in an effort to shut them down. Organizations like the DNS Measurement Factory published a survey of top offenders by network, and more recently the Open Resolver Project published a full list of the 27 million open servers online. Jeff Moss, a member of the president's Homeland Security Advisory Council and chief security officer at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, said the campaign was slowly paying off, with thousands dropping off that list in the last few months. ''We are slowly trying to chip away at these open resolvers and let people know they really need to do the right thing,'' he said. Paradoxically, it is the very strength of the Internet -- that it is composed of millions of independent computers -- that also makes this type of vulnerability a continuing threat. If the attackers had started their attack from a single computer, it could be stifled, but botnets give the anonymous individuals who control them great potential power. ''Long term, it comes down to those machines being infected,'' said Ulf Lindqvist, a director of research and development at the nonprofit research group SRI. ''If this one was one source, you could knock that source. But when it's coming from all over the place, and the targets have a hard time filtering what is legitimate traffic from what's not, then it becomes extremely difficult to defend against.'' Internet engineers said they hoped that the attacks would have a silver lining. ''Because the Internet is so open and so large, it takes one of these really nasty events for those configurations to be done properly,'' said Dan Holden, a director of threat response at Arbor Networks, a computer security firm based in Burlington, Mass. ''This is an opportunity for us to educate network operators to reconfigure their networks,'' said Rick Wesson, the chief executive of Support Intelligence, a San Francisco-based company that sells information about computer security threats to corporations and federal agencies. ''We spend too much time discussing cyberwar and not enough time discussing what a peaceful Internet looks like -- and that is one in which people implement BCP 38 and care about their neighbors.'' "
U.S. Accuses 13 Hackers in Web Attacks,"Thirteen members of a hacking collective that calls itself Anonymous were indicted on Thursday on charges that they conspired to coordinate attacks against prominent Web sites. The 13 are accused of bringing down at least six Web sites, including those belonging to the Recording Industry Association of America, Visa and MasterCard.  The attacks caused ''significant damage to the victims,'' the indictment said. The attacks, carried out from September 2010 to January 2011, were part of campaign called Operation Payback, which started as an effort to support file-sharing sites but later rallied around WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange. Hackers took down the sites by inflicting a denial of service, or DDoS, attack, in which they fired Web traffic at a site until it collapsed under the load. Though the indictment mentions 13 hackers, thousands more participated in the attack by clicking on Web links that temporarily turned their computers into a digital fire hose aimed at each victim, in this case the Web sites. According to the indictment, which was handed up at Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., the hackers' tool of choice was a simple open-source application known as Low Orbit Ion Cannon, which requires very little technical know-how. Hackers simply posted a Web link online that allowed volunteers to download an application that turned their computer into a ''botnet,'' or network of computers, that flooded targets like Visa.com and MasterCard.com with traffic until they crashed. For instance, on Sept. 16, 2010, a member of Anonymous posted on a bulletin board advertising an attack against the Web site for the Motion Picture Association of America, the indictment said. The instructions were to carry out the ''first wave'' of attack at 9 p.m. According to the indictment, the posting said: ''This will be a calm, coordinated display of blood. We will not be merciful.'' Anonymous, a loose collective, has in the past carried out politically motivated attacks. In December, the group hacked into the Facebook and Twitter accounts belonging to the Westboro Baptist Church, after the church's members had threatened to picket at a vigil for victims of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shootings, claiming ''God sent the shooter'' in retaliation for Connecticut having legalized same-sex marriage. In November, Anonymous began attacks against Israeli sites in retaliation for Israeli military strikes on Hamas. In February 2012, hackers claiming to belong to Anonymous took down the Web site for the Mexican National Chamber of Mines and claimed to have stolen its e-mail. On a bulletin board, the hackers said the attack was in retaliation for Mexican miners' ''extreme'' working conditions. "
China Is Tied to Spying On European Diplomats,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Computer breaches at the foreign ministries of the Czech Republic, Portugal, Bulgaria, Latvia and Hungary have been traced to Chinese hackers. The attacks, which began in 2010, are continuing, according to a report to be released Tuesday by FireEye, a computer security company in Milpitas, Calif. Though researchers do not name the hackers' targets in the report, The New York Times identified the foreign ministries through email addresses listed on the attackers' web page. A person with knowledge of the investigation, who was not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed that the foreign ministries of the five countries had been breached.  Even as revelations by Edward J. Snowden about surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency and its intelligence partners dominate attention, the FireEye report is a reminder that Chinese hackers continue to break into the computer systems of governments and firms using simple, email-based attacks. The FireEye report does not link the attacks to a specific group in China, but security experts say the list of victims points to a state-affiliated campaign. ''Unlike other groups, which tend to attack commercial targets, this campaign specifically targeted ministries of foreign affairs,'' said Nart Villeneuve, the researcher who helped lead FireEye's efforts. Last year, Mr. Villeneuve, then a researcher at Trend Micro, a security company in Tokyo, traced a series of attacks on firms in Japan and India, as well as Tibetan activists, to a former graduate student at Sichuan University who had joined Tencent, China's leading Internet company. Mr. Villeneuve said the current hacks were highly selective. Researchers first began tracking the campaign -- which they call ''Ke3Chang'' after a reference buried in the malware code -- in 2011. That October, various Group of 20 finance ministers were targeted during a summit meeting in Paris. The attackers sent their targets emails with a link that claimed to contain naked photos of Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, wife of former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. Once clicked, attackers were able to gain a foothold into their targets' computer networks, though investigators said they were unable to see which files the attackers had taken. The closest they came was last August when FireEye's researchers were able to infiltrate one of the group's 23 command-and-control servers for one week. They could see that the server had breached 21 different targets, including government ministries in the five European countries. They watched as attackers mapped out victims' computer networks, searching for users with privileged access who would allow them entry into the computers of high value targets. That glimpse gave researchers a rare window into the attackers' techniques and clues to their origin. Their malware contained Chinese character strings and one Web page used to compromise computers was written in Chinese. They also used several machines to test their malware which used the Chinese language as the default setting. ''Beyond the fact they are Chinese, we don't know who the attackers are or what their motivations might be,'' Mr. Villeneuve said. China's Foreign Ministry officials have said China does not sanction hacking, and is itself a victim of hacking attacks. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not return a request for comment on Monday. Security experts say foreign ministries have long been a target for Chinese hackers. James A. Lewis, a former State Department official and senior fellow and director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said past hacking attacks on the foreign ministries of Australia, Britain, Germany, France, India and Canada had all been traced to the Chinese government. ''The Chinese are eager to look at foreign ministries to glean trade information and because they can read what foreign diplomats are saying about the Americans or Japanese,'' he said. Rob Rachwald, FireEye's senior director of research, said the company had witnessed other campaigns in which attackers had broken into foreign ministries and think tanks to steal early drafts of policy papers specifically related to China. Mr. Rachwald said FireEye had notified the latest victims but that in many cases they only deployed bare basic computer security defenses in response. David Frous, a deputy spokesman for the Czech Republic's Ministry said the ministry could not comment. ''However, I can assure you every precaution to prevent hacking on our computer systems is being made,'' he said. Karlis Eihenbaums, a spokesman for the Latvian Foreign Ministry, said the ministry had no comment. Spokesmen for the Portuguese, Hungarian and Bulgarian foreign ministries did not respond to requests for comment. FireEye's researchers have traced three different variants of malware back to Ke3Chang. From there, they were able to see that the same attackers had also targeted organizations in the aerospace, energy, high-tech, consulting, chemical, manufacturing and mining sectors. Most recently, the attackers have tried to bait targets into clicking on a link in an email purporting to contain information about possible American military intervention in Syria. Researchers say the emails predated the most recent G-20 meeting in Russia last September. Using current events to bait targets is nothing new. In March 2012, researchers say the same group used an email about the London Olympics. Three months later, the same group repurposed a security report from McAfee, the antivirus software pioneer, and loaded it with malicious code so that as soon as a target clicked on the attachment, attackers gained a foothold into their machines. FireEye said the Ke3Chang attackers have taken great pains to mask their activities by frequently switching out their hacking tools. And though researchers have only identified 23 of the attackers' command-and-control servers, they mapped Web addresses back to a total of 99 servers -- all of them based in China, Hong Kong and the United States -- and believe the number of compromised computers is much larger than what they can see. ''It is so easy to hack foreign targets, intelligence agencies can't resist,'' said Mr. Lewis. "
Malicious Software Poses as Video from a Facebook Friend,"A piece of malicious software masquerading as a Facebook video is hijacking users' Facebook accounts and Web browsers, according to independent Italian security researchers who have been investigating the situation. The malware appears as a link in an e-mail or Facebook message telling people that they have been tagged in a Facebook post. When users go to Facebook and click the link, they are sent to a separate Web site and prompted to download a browser extension or plug-in to watch a video, said one of the researchers, Carlo De Micheli, in a telephone interview on Monday. Once that plug-in is downloaded, the attackers can access everything stored in the browser, including accounts with saved passwords. Many people commonly save e-mail, Facebook and Twitter login data in their browsers, so the attackers can masquerade as the victim and tap those accounts.  Mr. De Micheli said the malicious software has been spreading at a rate of about 40,000 attacks an hour and has so far affected more than 800,000 people using Google's popular Chrome browser. It is replicating itself primarily by hijacking victims' Facebook accounts and reaching out to their friends on the social network. A user hit by the malicious software cannot easily remove it, since it blocks access to the browser settings that allow it to be removed and also blocks access to many sites that offer virus removal software. A spokeswoman for Google, which makes the Chrome browser, said the company was aware of the attack and has already disabled the browser extensions that allowed it. ""When we detect items containing malware or learn of them through reports, we remove them from the Chrome Web Store and from active Chrome instances,"" said the spokeswoman, Veronica Navarrete, in a statement. ""We've already removed several of these extensions, and are continuing to improve our automated systems to help detect them even faster."" Facebook said that its security systems had also detected the attack and it was working to clear the malicious links. ""In the meantime, we have been blocking people from clicking through the links and have reported the bad browser extensions to the appropriate parties,""  Michael Kirkland, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. ""We believe only a small percentage of our users were affected by this issue, and we are currently working with them to ensure that they've removed the bad browser extension."" However, Mr. De Micheli said the attackers, who appear to be of Turkish origin based on comments embedded in the software, were adapting the malicious code and had already found a way to target users of Firefox, another popular browser. This is not the first instance of an attack through a browser extension, which is a bit of software that allows a Web browser to perform specific functions, much like an app does for a smartphone. But this attack appears to be one of the most extensive to use the technology. ""A few years ago, you'd tell your friends, don't click on attachments,"" Mr. De Micheli said. Now, the same advice applies to browser add-ons, he said. Mr. De Micheli said that browser makers should do a better job of warning users that installing a plug-in, like installing a smartphone app, can give the software access to a wide variety of personal information. ""People are used to clicking 'accept,'"" he said. Mr. De Micheli is an independent security researcher who, along with several other Italian colleagues, has done extensive work tracking unseemly activity on social networks, including the underground market in fake Twitter followers. In the case of the malicious browser extensions, he is working with Andrea Stroppa, Danny di Stefano and Matt Hofman. Justin O'Kelly, a spokesman for Mozilla, said that users should make sure that they are only installing legitimate software from well-known Web sites that they trust. ""Users should be wary of scams or suspicious messages asking them to install software from an unknown site,"" he said in a statement.  "
Civil Liberties Fears Doom House Cybersecurity Bill,"The White House on Tuesday threatened to veto a House bill that would allow private companies to share information about computer security threats with government agencies, signaling once again how difficult it is to balance civil liberties and security interests in the digital era.  A similar bill, the Cyberintelligence Sharing and Protection Act, known as Cispa, passed the Republican-controlled House of Representatives last year. It, too, faced a veto threat from the Obama administration, along with outcry from civil liberties groups that feared that the government would use it to snoop on private citizens. This year, sponsors of the bill, House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers, a Republican from Michigan, and C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat from Maryland, tweaked the language in a bid to satisfy critics. The House is expected to vote on the bill this week. A National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, on Tuesday described those as ""a good faith effort,"" but insufficient. Specifically, the administration said private firms should be required to try to ""remove irrelevant personal information"" when sharing cyber threat information with each other or with government agencies. ""Citizens have a right to know that corporations will be held accountable - and not granted immunity - for failing to safeguard personal information adequately,"" the White House said in a statement. Some technology industry groups, most recently TechNet, have backed the bill, while civil liberties advocates rallied against it. The Center for Democracy and Technology said it could cede too much control to a military intelligence agency, while the American Civil Liberties Unionorganized a petition drive warning that the law could allow government surveillance over e-mail communications and location data of ordinary Internet users. The administration passed an executive order last February compelling government agencies to tell private firms about cyber risks, but not vice-versa. The president, in his State of the Union address, explicitly cited the need to protect both ""national security"" and ""privacy.""   "
Webcam's Flaw Put Users' Lives On Display,"WASHINGTON -- The so-called Internet of Things -- digitally connected devices like appliances, cars and medical equipment -- promises to make life easier for consumers. But regulators are worried that some products may be magnets for hackers. On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission took its first action to protect consumers from reckless invasions of privacy, penalizing a company that sells Web-enabled video cameras for lax security practices.  According to the F.T.C., the company, TRENDnet, told customers that its products were ''secure,'' marketing its cameras for home security and baby monitoring. In fact, the devices were compromised. The commission said a hacker in January 2012 exploited a security flaw and posted links to the live feeds, which ''displayed babies asleep in their cribs, young children playing and adults going about their daily lives.'' ''The Internet of Things holds great promise for innovative consumer products and services,'' Edith Ramirez, the commission's chairwoman, said in a statement. ''But consumer privacy and security must remain a priority as companies develop more devices that connect to the Internet.'' TRENDnet officials did not respond to a request for comment. While the Internet of Things is still evolving, the concept currently embraces both industrial and consumer products. In a factory, sensors can be used to monitor manufacturing processes, warning that a machine needs maintenance and potentially avoiding a breakdown. At home, so-called smart appliances like refrigerators or thermostats can feed information via the Internet to manufacturers and service providers to keep the products humming. In a speech last month, Ms. Ramirez noted that such developments required more diligence by consumers and regulators. While many individuals consent to data collection, consumers rarely are consulted about where their personal information goes afterward. The F.T.C. plans to conduct a workshop in November to discuss the issue, with an eye toward drawing up rules that allow for both innovation and the protection of consumers. Robert R. Belair, who formerly served in the commission's division of consumer protection and who is now the managing partner of the Washington office of Arnall Golden Gregory, said it was not yet clear whether the Internet of Things ''changes the nature of the privacy threat, or just exacerbates the threat in certain ways that require a little more vigilance.'' In detailing the security lapses, the commission said the company transmitted customers' login information over the Internet in clear, readable text rather than encrypting the data. It also said TRENDnet's mobile application, which allows customers to control the home camera from a smartphone, did not properly protect users' credentials. When the company became aware of the flaws, it uploaded a software patch to its Web site and tried to alert customers. As part of the case, TRENDnet agreed to sanctions that include a 20-year security-compliance auditing program. The company also promised not to misrepresent the security of its cameras, the confidentiality of the activity that its devices transmit, or consumers' ability to control the security of the cameras or their recordings. The agency's four current commissioners voted unanimously for the sanctions. The F.T.C. does not have the legal authority to impose fines in such cases. But TRENDnet agreed to a consent order prohibiting similar practices, so the commission has the ability to seek penalties in the future. Despite its recent action, the F.T.C.'s authority in this area has been called into question. The Wyndham Hotel Group is challenging the commission's ability to penalize companies that do not do enough to protect consumer information, like credit card numbers. Wyndham has argued that the agency has not published any formal rules on data security. The case is pending in Federal District Court in New Jersey. The case against TRENDnet highlights the potential vulnerabilities that consumers face when they connect everyday, in-home products to the Internet. As with e-mail accounts, online banking and shopping Web sites, enterprising hackers can get around security systems when vendors are sloppy. In 2010, TRENDnet began selling its digitally connected cameras under the product name SecurView. With the device, individuals and businesses could, via an individual Web site, monitor family members, customers or security concerns. In three years, its camera business produced nearly $19 million in revenue, accounting for 10 percent of the company's total revenue in that period. According to the F.T.C., a hacker in 2012 identified a security flaw and circulated the information publicly. Though the company was notified of the breach within three days, others saw the message and quickly posted links to live video feeds of about 700 cameras. The commission said that the hacker was able ''to identify a Web address that appeared to support the public sharing of users' live feeds.'' While only some customers opted to share their feeds publicly, the hacker found that all of the feeds could be viewed and shared, the commission said. After the episode, news accounts sometimes included photos taken from the feeds. Consumers ''had little, if any, reason to know that their information was at risk,'' the commission said. That kind of exposure ''increases the likelihood that consumers or their property will be targeted for theft or other criminal activity,'' the F.T.C. said, and ''increases the likelihood that consumers' personal activities and conversations or those of their family members, including young children, will be observed and recorded by strangers over the Internet.''

"In Hacking, A.P. Twitter Feed Sends False Report of Explosions","Hackers hijacked the Twitter account for The Associated Press on Tuesday and sent out an erroneous message reporting explosions at the White House that injured President Obama. Within minutes, Jay Carney, Mr. Obama's press secretary, confirmed that the president was unharmed, and Julie Pace, the chief White House correspondent for The A.P., announced at a White House briefing that the account had been hacked. Twitter suspended the account but by then the post had already moved markets. The Dow Jones industrial average abruptly plummeted more than 150 points, then surged back after it became clear there had been no incident.  A group calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army claimed responsibility for the attack. The group's Twitter account is linked to the Web site Syrianelectronicarmy.com, an Arabic language Web site that broadcasts what the group says are its latest computer attacks. Even as the Twitter accounts for @AP and @AP_Mobile were suspended Tuesday afternoon, the Syrian Electronic Army was posting. Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama http://t.co/HTKoO6gIL6 -- SyrianElectronicArmy (@Official_SEA6) 23 Apr 13 The A.P.'s account was the sixth prominent Twitter account to be hacked in recent months. On Saturday, three CBS-affiliated Twitter accounts were hacked and used to post suspicious links. Hackers, saying they were part of the Syrian Electronic Army, claimed responsibility for hacking several NPR Twitter accounts last week as well as BBC Twitter accounts last month. The episodes raise questions about the security of social media passwords and the ease of access to brand-name accounts. Logging on to Twitter requires the same process for a company as for a consumer -- just a user name and one password. Security experts say Twitter could do more. The company has yet to offer its users two-factor authentication, a service that texts a second login PIN to users' mobile phones, to keep attackers from hijacking their accounts with a single, stolen password. Microsoft rolled out two-factor authentication last week. Apple added it in March. Both Google and Facebook have offered the service for years. ''It's a very established baseline,'' said Mark Risher, co-founder of Imperium, a Silicon Valley start-up that aims to help social networks. ''But there are costs, and user friction is introduced. You could put four deadbolts on your front door, but it's going to be a pain every time you go to the drugstore. That said, why not offer it? I don't have a good answer for that.'' Officials at Twitter did not return requests for comment. In the past, the company has said that security is something it does not take lightly. Twitter has automatic and manual controls to help identify malicious content on the site, and last year Twitter sued those responsible for five of the most-used spamming tools on the site. But preventing hacking and identifying fake accounts continues to be more art than science. Security researchers estimate that as many as 20 million Twitter accounts on the platform are fakes, and real accounts continue to be catnip for hackers. Security experts also say it is not clear whether two-factor authentication would have prevented the attack on The A.P.'s account. Paul Colford, a spokesman for The A.P., said the hacking incident was preceded by a ''phishing'' attempt on The A.P.'s corporate e-mail network. Employees had been sent e-mails with malicious links or attachments that, once clicked, would give an attacker a foothold. ''In the case of a phishing message, two-factor authentication would not eliminate the problem,'' Mr. Risher said. ''There are ways to circumvent this. I could create a fake Web page for Twitter and ask you to enter your user credentials.'' Mr. Colford said the phishing attempt had been blocked, raising the question of how hackers had grabbed credentials for the account. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"In Hours, Thieves Took $45 Million in A.T.M. Scheme","It was a brazen bank heist, but a 21st-century version in which the criminals never wore ski masks, threatened a teller or set foot in a vault. In two precision operations that involved people in more than two dozen countries acting in close coordination and with surgical precision, thieves stole $45 million from thousands of A.T.M.'s in a matter of hours. In New York City alone, the thieves responsible for A.T.M. withdrawals struck 2,904 machines over 10 hours starting on Feb. 19, withdrawing $2.4 million. The operation included sophisticated computer experts operating in the shadowy world of Internet hacking, manipulating financial information with the stroke of a few keys, as well as common street criminals, who used that information to loot the automated teller machines.  The first to be caught was a street crew operating in New York, their pictures captured as, prosecutors said, they traveled the city withdrawing money and stuffing backpacks with cash. On Thursday, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn unsealed an indictment charging eight men -- including their suspected ringleader, who was found dead in the Dominican Republic last month. The indictment and criminal complaints in the case offer a glimpse into what the authorities said was one of the most sophisticated and effective cybercrime attacks ever uncovered. It was, prosecutors said, one of the largest heists in New York City history, rivaling the 1978 Lufthansa robbery, which inspired a scene in the movie ''Goodfellas.'' Beyond the sheer amount of money involved, law enforcement officials said, the thefts underscored the vulnerability of financial institutions around the world to clever criminals working to stay a step ahead of the latest technologies designed to thwart them. ''In the place of guns and masks, this cybercrime organization used laptops and the Internet,'' said Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn. ''Moving as swiftly as data over the Internet, the organization worked its way from the computer systems of international corporations to the streets of New York City, with the defendants fanning out across Manhattan to steal millions of dollars from hundreds of A.T.M.'s in a matter of hours.'' The indictment outlined how the criminals were able to steal data from banks, relay that information to a far-flung network of so-called cashing crews, and then have the stolen money laundered in purchases of luxury items like Rolex watches and expensive cars. In the first operation, hackers infiltrated the system of an unnamed Indian credit-card processing company that handles Visa and MasterCard prepaid debit cards. Such companies are attractive to cybercriminals because they are considered less secure than financial institutions, computer security experts say. The hackers, who are not named in the indictment, then raised the withdrawal limits on prepaid MasterCard debit accounts issued by the National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah, also known as RakBank, which is in United Arab Emirates. Once the withdrawal limits have been eliminated, ''even a few compromised bank account numbers can result in tremendous financial loss to the victim financial institution,'' the indictment states. And by using prepaid cards, the thieves were able to take money without draining the bank accounts of individuals, which might have set off alarms more quickly. With five account numbers in hand, the hackers distributed the information to individuals in 20 countries who then encoded the information on magnetic-stripe cards. On Dec. 21, the cashing crews made 4,500 A.T.M. transactions worldwide, stealing $5 million, according to the indictment. While the street crews were taking money out of bank machines, the computer experts were watching the financial transactions from afar, ensuring that they would not be shortchanged on their cut, according to court documents. MasterCard alerted the Secret Service to the activity soon after the transactions were completed, said a law enforcement official, who declined to be identified discussing a continuing investigation. Robert D. Rodriguez, a special agent with the Secret Service for 22 years and now the chairman of Security Innovation Network, said that in some ways the crime was as old as money itself: bad guys trying to find weaknesses in a system and exploiting that weakness. ''The difference today is that the dynamics of the Internet and cyberspace are so fast that we have a hard time staying ahead of the adversary,'' he said. And because these crimes are global, he said, even when the authorities figure out who is behind them they might not be able to arrest them or persuade another law enforcement agency to take action. After pulling off the December theft, the organization grew more bold, and two months later it struck again -- this time nabbing $40 million. On Feb. 19, cashing crews were in place at A.T.M.'s across Manhattan and in two dozen other countries waiting for word to spring into action. This time, the hackers had infiltrated a credit-card processing company based in the United States that also handles Visa and MasterCard prepaid debit cards. Prosecutors did not disclose the company's name. After securing 12 account numbers for cards issued by the Bank of Muscat in Oman and raising the withdrawal limits, the cashing crews were set in motion. Starting at 3 p.m., the crews made 36,000 transactions and withdrew about $40 million from machines in the various countries in about 10 hours. In New York City, a team of eight people made 2,904 withdrawals, stealing $2.4 million. Surveillance photos of one suspect at various A.T.M.'s showed the man's backpack getting heavier and heavier, Ms. Lynch said, comparing the series of thefts to the caper at the center of the movie ''Ocean's Eleven.'' While the New York crew had a productive spree, the crews in Japan seem to have been the most successful, stealing around $10 million, probably because some banks in Japan allow withdrawals of as much as $10,000 from a single bank machine. ''The significance here is they are manipulating the financial system to be able to change these balance limits and withdrawal limits,'' said Kim Peretti, a former prosecutor in the computer crime division of the Justice Department who is now a partner in the law firm Alston & Bird. ''When you have a scheme like this, where the system can be manipulated to quickly get access to millions of dollars that in some sense did not exist before, it could be a systemic risk to our financial system.'' It was unclear to whom the hacked accounts belonged, and who might ultimately be responsible for the losses. The indictment suggests a far-reaching operation, but there were few details about the people responsible for conducting the hacking or who might be leading the global operation. Law enforcement agencies in more than a dozen countries are still investigating, according to federal prosecutors. The authorities said the leader of the New York cashing crew was Alberto Lajud-Peña, 23, whose body was found in the Dominican Republic late last month. Seven other people were charged with conspiracy to commit ''access device fraud'' and money laundering. The prosecutors said they were all American citizens and were based in Yonkers. The age of one defendant was given as 35; the others were all said to be 22 to 24. Mr. Lajud-Peña fled the United States just as the authorities were starting to make arrests of members of his crew, the law enforcement official said. On April 27, according to news reports from the Dominican Republic, two hooded gunmen stormed a house where he was playing dominoes and began shooting. A manila envelope containing about $100,000 in cash remained untouched. "
Cyberattacks on the Rise Against U.S. Corporations,"WASHINGTON -- A new wave of cyberattacks is striking American corporations, prompting warnings from federal officials, including a vague one issued last week by the Department of Homeland Security. This time, officials say, the attackers' aim is not espionage but sabotage, and the source seems to be somewhere in the Middle East. The targets have primarily been energy companies, and the attacks appeared to be probes, looking for ways to seize control of their processing systems. The attacks are continuing, officials said. But two senior administration officials said Sunday that they were still not certain exactly where the attacks were coming from, or whether they were state-sponsored or the work of hackers or criminals.  ''We are concerned by these intrusions, and we are trying to make sure they don't lead to something much bigger, as they did in the Saudi case,'' said one senior American official. He was referring to the aggressive attack last summer that affected 30,000 computers at Saudi Aramco, one of the world's largest oil producers. After lengthy investigations, American officials concluded that Iran had been behind the Saudi Aramco attack. Another official said that in the new wave of attacks, ''most everything we have seen is coming from the Middle East,'' but he did not say whether Iran, or another country, appeared to be the source. Last week's warning was unusual because most attacks against American companies -- especially those coming from China -- have been attempts to obtain confidential information, steal trade secrets and gain competitive advantage. By contrast, the new attacks seek to destroy data or to manipulate industrial machinery and take over or shut down the networks that deliver energy or run industrial processes. That kind of attack is much more like the Stuxnet worm that the United States and Israel secretly used against Iran's nuclear enrichment plants several years ago, to slow Iran's progress toward a nuclear weapons capability. When that covert program began, President Obama, among other officials, expressed worry that its eventual discovery could prompt retaliatory attacks. Two senior officials who have been briefed on the new intrusions say they were aimed largely at the administrative systems of about 10 major American energy firms, which they would not name. That is similar to what happened to Saudi Aramco, where a computer virus wiped data from office computers, but never succeeded in making the leap to the industrial control systems that run oil production. The Washington Post first reported the security warning on Friday. Over the weekend the Obama administration described what had led to the warning. Those officials began describing the activity as ''probes that suggest someone is looking at how to take control of these systems.'' According to one United States official, Homeland Security officials decided to release the warning once they saw how deeply intruders had managed to penetrate corporate systems, including one that deals with chemical processes. In the past, the government occasionally approached individual companies it believed were under threat. Last week's warning ''is an effort to make sure that the volume and timeliness of the information improves,'' in line with a new executive order signed by the president, one senior official said. The warning was issued by an agency called ICS-Cert, which monitors attacks on computer systems that run industrial processes. It said the government was ''highly concerned about hostility against critical infrastructure organizations,'' and included a link to a previous warning about Shamoon, the virus used in the Saudi Aramco attack last year. It also hinted that federal investigations were under way, referring to indications ''that adversary intent extends beyond intellectual property to include use of cyber to disrupt business and control systems.'' At Saudi Aramco, the virus replaced company data on thousands of computers with an image of a burning American flag. The attack prompted the defense secretary at the time, Leon E. Panetta, to warn of an impending ''cyber 9/11'' if the United States did not respond more efficiently to attacks. American officials have since concluded the attack and a subsequent one at RasGas, the Qatari energy company, were the work of Iranian hackers. Israeli officials, who follow Iran closely, said in interviews this month that they thought the attacks were the work of Iran's new ''cybercorps,'' organized after the cyberattacks that affected their nuclear facilities. Saudi Aramco said that while the attackers had attempted to penetrate its oil production systems, they had failed because the company maintained a separation between employees' administrative computers and the computers used to control and monitor production. RasGas said the attack on its computers had failed for the same reason. But there are no clear standards for computer security, and the Homeland Security warning last week urged companies to take steps many computer professionals already advise. The suggestions were for ''things most everyone should be doing on an everyday basis,'' said Dan McWhorter, the managing director of threat intelligence at Mandiant Corporation. His company conducted a study this year that identified a specific unit of the Chinese Army as the source of a number of attacks on American businesses and government organizations. ''These are all threats people have been seeing coming for some time,'' he said. Still, the warning underscored that most of the likely targets in the United States, including cellphone networks and electric utility grids, are in private rather than government hands. ''The challenge will be managing our nation's offensive and defensive capabilities,'' said Evan D. Wolff, a partner at Hunton & Williams, who runs the firm's homeland security practice and focuses on cyberissues. ''Unlike conventional weapons, this will require a very broad engagement across the private sector.'' For the last four years, the Department of Homeland Security has said it needs to expand its cybersecurity force by as many as 600 hacking specialists to keep pace with the rising number of threats. But in the last four months, the department has been grappling with an exodus of top officials, including Jane Holl Lute, the agency's deputy secretary; Mark Weatherford, the department's top cybersecurity official; Michael Locatis, the assistant secretary for cybersecurity; and Richard Spires, the agency's chief information officer, all of whom resigned.

Daily Report: Europe Weighs Requiring Firms to Disclose Data Breaches,"To combat a rise in cybercrime, the European Commission is considering a plan to require companies that store data on the Internet - like Microsoft, Apple, Google and I.B.M. - to report the loss or theft of personal information in the 27-nation bloc or risk sanctions and fines, Kevin J. O'Brien reports Thursday in The International Herald Tribune and The New York Times.  The proposal aims to impose, for the first time, reporting requirements across the European Union on companies that run large databases, those used for Internet searches, social networks, e-commerce or cloud services. The proposed directive would supplant a patchwork of national laws in Europe that have made reporting mandatory in Germany and Spain, but voluntary in Britain and Italy. While European lawmakers are trying to limit cybercrime, the plan  has generated controversy because it would extend the obligation to report data breaches beyond traditional compilers of customer databases - telephone, transport and utility companies. The technology industry supports the idea of a more systematic approach to the flagging of security breaches, but says the proposal needs more specific guidelines to ensure that notifications are required only when necessary and useful to consumers. Cybercrime has risen sharply in Europe. A series of high-profile hacking attacks on governments and businesses has galvanized European lawmakers to focus on the need to strengthen and harmonize existing laws, which vary widely across the Union and differ on the levels of disclosure required.

The Syrian Electronic Army Is At It Again,"It's a happy hacker holiday once again. This Christmas it's not Anonymous or Iranian hackers you need to worry about - it's the Syrian Electronic Army.  On Tuesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation dispatched warning notices that the S.E.A. was at it again, according to two people who received the notices, which included various digital clues to help companies block attempted cyberattacks. On Tuesday, some members of the media, including at The New York Times, received emails containing malicious links purporting to be a CNN news article about the conflict in Syria. The emails, which appeared to come from colleagues in some cases, redirected recipients to fake Google log-in pages that requested their usernames and password credentials. As in previous S.E.A. attacks, that information allows hackers to get into an employee's email account and in some cases administrative systems, where they can gather user credentials to a site's publishing platform or Twitter or Facebook account. S.E.A. hackers have used those platforms to post messages supporting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, or to post fake news articles. This was the case last April, when hackers from the group posted a fake tweet from the Associated Press Twitter account about purported explosions at the White House, sending the stock market into momentary free fall. In August, The Times's website was disrupted after the S.E.A. attacked the company's domain name registrar, Melbourne IT. The S.E.A. emerged in May 2011, during the first Syrian uprisings, when it began attacking a wide array of media outlets and nonprofits and spamming popular Facebook pages like President Obama's and Oprah Winfrey's with pro-Assad comments. The group's goal, it  said, was to offer a pro-government counternarrative to media coverage of Syria. The group, which also disrupted The Washington Post in August and The Financial Times in May, has consistently denied ties to the Syrian government and has said it does not target Syrian dissidents, but security researchers and Syrian rebels say they are not convinced. They say the group is the outward-facing campaign of a much quieter surveillance campaign focused on Syrian dissidents and are quick to point out that Mr. Assad once referred to the S.E.A. as ""a real army in a virtual reality."" Federal authorities and security researchers continue to track the group and caution news organizations to be vigilant about opening e-mails that contain out-of-context links, or spelling errors or grammatical mistakes, and, particularly, those that redirect users to phishing sites that ask for their log-in credentials.

"Cisco: Big Data Is the Network, Too","John Chambers says the profits from Cisco Systems' new strategy are still one to three years away. The strategy, however, is already becoming more clear: Big Data will only work if it's delivered through the network, and that could go hand-in-hand with consolidation among companies that specialize in data analysis and networking or traditional computing. ""You can't ship the information from 50 billion devices all the way up the line,"" said Mr. Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, in an interview last week. That means that increasingly sophisticated computing has to be built into networking devices.  This is, of course, an argument that plays to Cisco's strengths. The company's Unified Computing System, or UCS, of computer servers built into the network has in a relatively quick time become an important part of Cisco's revenue. In December, Cisco's chief executivelaid out a plan for the world's biggest maker of computer networking equipment to move more into software and consulting services. It is not the first time he's tried to expand Cisco's reach in those valuable markets, but in this case Mr. Chambers hopes to achieve it through ""the Internet of Everything,"" or a world rich in sensors and monitoring systems.  Because of this trend, ""We have the opportunity to be the top technology partner"" for the corporate world,"" Mr. Chambers said last week. ""Companies pay a premium to have a trusted partner.""  Just because he's being a little self-serving, however, doesn't mean Mr. Chambers is wrong about what is happening at the big technology companies.  Much the way Cisco has built UCS, IBM has spent over $16 billion on analytics companies. Hewlett-Packard, despite the problems associated with its $11 billion purchase of the Autonomy, is using aspects of Autonomy's analytics in its next networking and security offerings. Much of that could also end up in H.P.'s substantial networking business. Cisco has an advantage over those information technology companies, Mr. Chambers said, because the central issue is in a deep understanding how networks function. ""The IT players are trying to come into the network, and we're becoming one of the world's big server players. The two are collapsing into each other,"" he said. ""If things aren't tied well together you'll just cause a lot of complexity.""  Mr. Chambers' argument is essentially that Big Data analytics companies will have something like the experience of network security companies 10 years ago. Originally, things like firewalls were sufficient to stop most Internet attacks, and stand-alone security companies thrived.  As the traffic increased in size and diversity, however, security had to become an aspect of more parts of the overall system. RSA, one of the first big security companies, was purchased by EMC, a data storage company. McAfee, another security company, disappeared into Intel. As we rush to crunch data from more parts of both the Internet and the physical world, the argument runs, we will make analytics and computing part of everything. That could make it hard for independent analytics providers, or force them to also adopt networking or computing businesses. But that would require a lot of money. The question could ultimately be whether the center of the system is in the data, as EMC thinks, or in H.P.'s servers, IBM's software, or Cisco's network. As the saying goes, where you stand has a lot to do with where you sit.  "
N.S.A. Director Firmly Defends Surveillance Efforts,"FORT MEADE, Md. -- The director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, said in an interview that to prevent terrorist attacks he saw no effective alternative to the N.S.A.'s bulk collection of telephone and other electronic metadata from Americans. But he acknowledged that his agency now faced an entirely new reality, and the possibility of Congressional restrictions, after revelations about its operations at home and abroad. While offering a detailed defense of his agency's work, General Alexander said the broader lesson of the controversy over disclosures of secret N.S.A. surveillance missions was that he and other top officials have to be more open in explaining the agency's role, especially as it expands its mission into cyberoffense and cyberdefense. ''Given where we are and all the issues that are on the table, I do feel it's important to have a public, transparent discussion on cyber so that the American people know what's going on,'' General Alexander said. ''And in order to have that, they need to understand the truth about what's going on.''  General Alexander, a career Army intelligence officer who also serves as head of the military's Cyber Command, has become the public face of the secret -- and, to many, unwarranted -- government collection of records about personal communications in the name of national security. He has given a number of speeches in recent weeks to counter a highly negative portrayal of the N.S.A.'s work, but the 90-minute interview was his most extensive personal statement on the issue to date. Speaking at the agency's heavily guarded headquarters, General Alexander acknowledged that his agency had stumbled in responding to the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the contractor who stole thousands of documents about the N.S.A.'s most secret programs. But General Alexander insisted that the chief problem was a public misunderstanding about what information the agency collects -- and what it does not -- not the programs themselves. ''The way we've explained it to the American people,'' he said, ''has gotten them so riled up that nobody told them the facts of the program and the controls that go around it.'' But he was firm in saying that the disclosures had allowed adversaries, whether foreign governments or terrorist organizations, to learn how to avoid detection by American intelligence and had caused ''significant and irreversible damage'' to national security. General Alexander said that he was extremely sensitive to the power of the software tools and electronic weapons being developed by the United States for surveillance and computer-network warfare, and that he set a very high bar for when the nation should use them for offensive purposes. ''I see no reason to use offensive tools unless you're defending the country or in a state of war, or you want to achieve some really important thing for the good of the nation and others,'' he said. Those comments were prompted by a document in the Snowden trove that said the United States conducted more than 200 offensive cyberattacks in 2011 alone. But American officials say that in reality only a handful of attacks have been carried out. They say the erroneous estimate reflected an inaccurate grouping of other electronic missions. But General Alexander would not discuss any specific cases in which the United States had used those weapons, including the best-known example: its years-long attack on Iran's nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. To critics of President Obama's administration, that decision made it easier for China, Iran and other nations to justify their own use of cyberweapons. General Alexander, who became the N.S.A. director in 2005, will retire early next year. The timing of his departure was set in March when his tour was extended for a third time, according to officials, who said it had nothing to do with the surveillance controversy spawned by the leaks. The appointment of his successor is likely to be a focal point of Congressional debate over whether the huge infrastructure that was built during his tenure will remain or begin to be restricted. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, has already drafted legislation to eliminate the N.S.A.'s ability to systematically obtain Americans' calling records. And Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican and co-author of the Patriot Act, is drafting a bill that would cut back on domestic surveillance programs. General Alexander was by turns folksy and firm in the interview. But he was unapologetic about the agency's strict culture of secrecy and unabashed in describing its importance to defending the nation. He insisted that it would have been impossible to have made public, in advance of the revelations by Mr. Snowden, the fact that the agency collected what it calls the ''business records'' of all telephone calls, and many other electronic communications, made in the United States. The agency is under rules preventing it from investigating that so-called haystack of data unless it has a ''reasonable, articulable'' justification, involving communications with terrorists abroad, he added. But he said the agency had not told its story well. As an example, he said, the agency itself killed a program in 2011 that collected the metadata of about 1 percent of all of the e-mails sent in the United States. ''We terminated it,'' he said. ''It was not operationally relevant to what we needed.'' However, until it was killed, the N.S.A. had repeatedly defended that program as vital in reports to Congress. Senior officials also said that one document in the Snowden revelations, an agreement with Israel, had been misinterpreted by those who believed that it meant the N.S.A. was sharing raw intelligence data on Americans, including the metadata on phone calls. Officials said the probability of American content in the shared data was extremely small. General Alexander said that confronting what he called the two biggest threats facing the United States -- terrorism and cyberattacks -- would require the application of expanded computer monitoring. In both cases, he said, he was open to much of that work being done by private industry, which he said could be more efficient than government. In fact, he said, a direct government role in filtering Internet traffic into the United States, in an effort to stop destructive attacks on Wall Street, American banks and the theft of intellectual property, would be inefficient and ineffective. ''I think it leads people to the wrong conclusion, that we're reading their e-mails and trying to listen to their phone calls,'' he said. Although he acknowledged that the N.S.A. must change its dialogue with the public, General Alexander was adamant that the agency adhered to the law. ''We followed the law, we follow our policies, we self-report, we identify problems, we fix them,'' he said. ''And I think we do a great job, and we do, I think, more to protect people's civil liberties and privacy than they'll ever know.'' "
"U.S. Is Losing Advantage In Spying, Report Says","WASHINGTON -- A congressional panel created long before the recent revelations about government electronic spying operations issued a blistering report on Tuesday charging that the intelligence world's research-and-development efforts are disorganized and unfocused. An unclassified version of the report, based on two years of work by independent experts and two officials from inside the agencies, concludes that the United States is losing its technological superiority over its rivals, which are gaining ''asymmetric advantages'' by making their own investments in such efforts and, in some cases, stealing American inventions.  In a separate white paper on cybercapabilities -- an area in which the Defense Department, the National Security Agency and the United States Cyber Command have made big investments -- the panel, the National Commission for the Review of the Research and Development Programs of the United States Intelligence Community, concludes that President Obama's efforts to differentiate the roles of competing agencies have largely failed. One member of the commission, Gilman Louie, a venture capitalist who was the founder of In-Q-Tel, a private fund that was set up by intelligence agencies to capitalize on advances in Silicon Valley, said commission members found that intelligence agency employees had little understanding of how Mr. Obama's efforts would affect their work. Mr. Louie also said the intelligence agencies were heavily focused on the development of offensive cyberweapons because ''it is easier and more intellectually interesting to play offense than defense.'' ''Defense is where we are losing the ballgame,'' he said. The most well-known American cyberweapons were developed in a program called Olympic Games and used against Iran's nuclear facilities. But the unclassified version of the commission's report makes no mention of the effort against Iran, an attempt to develop an entirely new class of weapons, or other individual research-and-development programs. All specific examples were stripped out, though the criticisms of the holes in the system remained, described entirely in generic terms. The document's findings have none of specificity and examples of the 9/11 Commission's report or a Bush-era commission report on the American efforts to track unconventional weapons. Commission members said the classified version of the report was more specific. The report questions the effectiveness of the administration's efforts, and heavy investment, in deterring and detecting cyberattacks. The commission also suggested that no one had an overview of the research and development underway. ''We couldn't even get a list,'' said Maurice Sonnenberg, a co-chairman of the commission. The panel's members were particularly critical of the role of the director of national intelligence, whose office was created after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, to coordinate the nation's 16 intelligence agencies. The leader of science and technology for the director's office, commission members said Tuesday, was not aware of some of the most classified research and development programs. They also found that intelligence agencies were duplicating efforts by pursuing similar projects at the same time, but because operations were compartmentalized, few researchers were aware of their colleagues' work. One commission member, Shirley Ann Jackson, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, found particular fault with the intelligence agencies' approach, ''which involves gathering more data than you need.'' Though the report makes no reference to the National Security Agency's bulk collection of telephone records, Ms. Jackson appeared to be referring to efforts like it. "
Obama Weighing Security and Privacy in Deciding on Spy Program Limits,"WASHINGTON -- If President Obama adopts the most far-reaching recommendations of the advisory group he set up to rein in the National Security Agency, much would change underneath the giant antennas that sprout over Fort Meade, Md., where America's electronic spies and cyberwarriors have operated with an unprecedented amount of freedom since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. No longer would a team of two dozen or so agency analysts be able to type into a computer that there was a ''reasonable, articulable suspicion'' about the person behind an American telephone number and, in seconds, see every call made to and from that phone -- followed by the same records for hundreds or thousands of their contacts. Instead, an individual court order would have to be obtained -- a far slower process that, just months ago, Mr. Obama's intelligence team insisted would be too cumbersome in halting attacks.  On the same guarded campus, military and civilian computer hackers working for the United States Cyber Command would be barred from using one of the most important building blocks of their growing arsenal of sophisticated cyberweapons. Every day they exploit previously unknown flaws in computer programs, known in the industry as ''zero-days,'' to conduct both surveillance and attacks. A handful of such flaws -- named for the fact that they have been known to the world for zero days, and thus cannot be defended against -- were central to attacking Iran's nuclear plant at Natanz. Already, critics of the advisory report have called it a form of unilateral disarmament. ''Bad idea,'' said James Lewis, the cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''We'd be the only country in the world to knock ourselves out of the market -- the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, every criminal gang would still be out there developing attacks'' with these flaws. For Mr. Obama -- who in the past five years has grown dependent on the N.S.A. for countering terrorist threats, and dependent on Cyber Command for buying time to deal with Iran and other long-term adversaries -- the choices he makes in the next few weeks may well define America's approach to national security long after his term is over. But it is a major balancing act between a security system that he has come to depend on and principles of privacy that he has said are dear to him. One of the five experts in the advisory group, Michael Morell, says the task is possible. ''We are not in any way recommending the disarming of the intelligence community,'' said Mr. Morell, who retired over the summer as deputy director of the C.I.A. But that is different from saying the choices are cost free. ''Both of these have operational impact; there is no question about that,'' Michael Hayden, a former director of both the N.S.A. and the C.I.A., said Thursday. ''For sure, there are other values than just intelligence collection. Those may be worth it. But there is no doubt that this will make the collection of intelligence slower and more difficult.'' The advisory group is not the only one weighing and shaping Mr. Obama's choices. His top counterterrorism aide, Lisa Monaco, is briefing him regularly about an interagency review that deals with many of the same issues as the outside advisory group. ''Not all of their recommendations were things we had focused on, and not everything we are focusing on in our review is necessarily addressed in their report,'' a senior administration official said Thursday. The administration expects to accept ''a good number'' of the advisory group recommendations, the official said, and will ''perhaps reject others.'' While few in the White House want to admit as much in public, none of this would have happened without the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor now in asylum in Russia. While Mr. Obama has said he welcomes the debate about the proper limits on the N.S.A., it is not one he engaged in publicly until the Snowden revelations began. Now the president has little choice -- this week alone a constellation of forces is pushing for change: A federal judge called the bulk-collection program ''almost Orwellian,'' while some in Congress, many of his allies and Silicon Valley executives demanded change. Those represent very different pressures. Mr. Obama has already said that bulk collection of telephone records should continue. The unresolved question is whether he agrees with the advisory committee that the records should remain in private hands -- either the telecommunications companies or a private consortium -- and that individual court authorizations should be required for every use of metadata. While Mr. Obama can deal with some of those issues by executive order, others would doubtless require congressional action -- and even his own party is deeply divided about how much leeway the N.S.A. should have. Mr. Obama has already acted on another recommendation, albeit quietly: The N.S.A. and the director of national intelligence are no longer able to monitor the cellphones and emails of leaders of other nations without White House approval. That does not mean no national leaders will be tapped; as Zbigniew Brzezinski said Thursday on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe,'' ''They are the ones we should be listening to.'' But now that one such operation has blown up in the N.S.A.'s hands -- the monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany -- Mr. Obama has begun to weigh their potential benefits against the huge diplomatic and economic costs if they are exposed. ''The president has made it clear he never wants to be blindsided by one of these again,'' one of his aides said. Under the advisory group's proposal he would not be: He would have to approve such operations. The president is also the one who must approve the use of cyberweapons. Gen. Keith Alexander, who leads both the N.S.A. and Cyber Command, said there were only ''a handful or less'' such attacks conducted by the United States. But designing the stealthiest cyberweapons occupies thousands of specialists and costs billions of dollars. The pressure to rein them in is coming from industry, which fears that the N.S.A.'s abilities to crack data encryption and bore into foreign computer systems and the cloud will scare away business across Europe and Asia. Mr. Obama must now make a choice: to keep building the world's most sophisticated cyberarsenal, or pare back for fear of harming American competitiveness. "
Lawmakers Dismiss China's Denials Over Cyberattacks,"In some of his strongest public remarks yet about the cyberattacks on American companies and government agencies that are believed to have been sponsored by China, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday that the situation was ""as bad as I've ever seen it and exponentially getting worse.""  The committee chairman, Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, confirmed recent reports of ambitious efforts by Chinese hacking groups - traced by one American computer security firm to a Chinese military unit in Shanghai - to penetrate American, European and Asian businesses and siphon off blueprints and corporate secrets. Obama administration officials have said the attacks have become so intense that they threaten the fundamental relationship between the United States and China. Beijing has denied any role in computer hacking, saying the activity is illegal. Asked on the ABC News program ""This Week"" whether he believed that the Chinese government and military were behind the economic espionage, Mr. Rogers replied, ""Beyond a shadow of a doubt."" He said the attacks were illegal and unprecedented in scope, and that the United States was not currently able to protect American companies from them. ""We're not ready yet,"" he said. ""We are completely vulnerable to this."" Mr. Rogers suggested that the United States use not just economic sanctions on those responsible but also to take tough action against specific Chinese individuals. ""I argue you need to start indicting bad actors,"" he said. ""You need to start impacting individuals' ability who are participating in this activity in China to get visas, their families to get visas."" ""It's that serious,"" he said. Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on the same program that he had confronted top Chinese officials with the accusations during a recent visit to Beijing. ""They just let it roll off their back,"" he said. ""They pooh-poohed it."" He said Washington should make it clear to the Chinese that ""there's a price to pay."" While some reports have suggested that the United States and Israel were likely behind cyberattacks against Iran's nuclear program, Mr. Rogers made two points: First, he said, that people should be ""very cautious about ascribing authorship"" for those attacks and, second, that such defensive attacks were different from the sort of economic espionage that China is suspected to be involved in. That, he said, was why he would ""send a message to China that you cannot - if you want to be an international player, you can't act like a thief in the night.""  "

Spying Scandal Alters Ties With Allies and Leads to Talk of U.S. Policy Shift,"BERLIN -- Just as European and American negotiators resumed work on a groundbreaking trade accord meant to tie their two continents closer together, René Obermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, the German telecommunications giant, told a cybersecurity conference in Germany on Monday that his company was working to keep electronic message traffic from ''unnecessarily'' crossing the Atlantic, where it could fall into the hands of the National Security Agency. Other German executives, and some politicians, are beginning to talk of segmenting the Internet, so that they are not reliant on large American firms that by contract or court order allow United States intelligence agencies to delve into their data about phone and Internet usage. Europeans are demanding that any new trade accord include data-privacy protections that the United States is eager to avoid.  Almost never before has a spying scandal -- in this case the revelation of the monitoring of the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany -- resulted in such a concrete, commercial backlash. Now it is also driving a debate inside the American government about whether the United States, which has long spied on allies even while nurturing them as partners, may have to change its approach. ''What's more important?'' Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the director of the N.S.A., asked during an interview last month, before the Merkel revelations. ''Partnering with countries may be more important than collecting on them,'' he said, especially when it comes to protecting against cyberthreats to the computer networks of the world's largest economies. So far the Obama administration has refused to talk publicly about that choice, other than to provide Germany with assurances that now, and in the future, Ms. Merkel's cellphone conversations will be safe. In the past two weeks, two pairs of senior German officials have visited Washington trying to negotiate a new accord on intelligence sharing that would set ground rules as their government faces its own choice between gently pushing back a protector that has patently played a double game for years, or asserting its power in ways unknown since 1945. John C. Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany, said he ''simply cannot imagine'' how the United States could target Germans that way ''and not end up with egg all over their face.'' ''It was unbelievably stupid, for no gain,'' he said. Over the weekend Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, told the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel that ''there should be a wholesale housecleaning'' of the American intelligence community, and, echoing Mr. Kornblum, said that General Alexander ''should resign, or be fired.'' The White House has backed General Alexander, who is scheduled to retire early next year, but even some of President Obama's advisers have begun questioning the judgment of the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., who is supposed to review the costs and benefits of these operations, and some officials, saying they are speaking for themselves, have suggested he should leave around the time General Alexander does. ''The only way the president is going to get a fresh start with the allies,'' one of his advisers said last week, ''is to present them with a new team.'' Germany is now toughening its demands that the United States respect all domestic and international laws -- code words for ceasing the surveillance on German soil amid rising anger at the United States. Veteran observers of relations between the two nations suspect that over time the anger will abate, as it has in past spy scandals. But that may not prove to be as easy as the officials hope. Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who worked on European security issues for Presidents George Bush and George W. Bush, noted recently ''the broad drifting away'' between Europe and the United States. For its part, Germany has amassed a different kind of power as Europe's foremost economy. And, as Berlin's bridling at United States Treasury criticism of its economic policy showed last week, the country is resolute in defending its financial moves. In addition to power shifts that require adjustments by both countries, each is experiencing a febrile moment politically and governmentally. The United States appears paralyzed in many ways, while in Germany, the conservative Ms. Merkel is negotiating a new government with the center-left Social Democrats. The attempt to rein in American activity is turning out to be harder than German officials hoped. The early talk that Germany would get the status accorded to Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- just about full sharing of data, and no-spy agreements -- has given way to a much more hardheaded discussion. Even German officials concede that a full-fledged accord is unlikely -- in part because it would require congressional approval -- and that negotiations are more likely to yield a memorandum of understanding. The United States has issued no public exemption from listening in on those in the German political, diplomatic or intelligence hierarchies other than Ms. Merkel. ''The reluctance is that you never know what you may need, in a month, or a year, or 10 years,'' one American intelligence official said. "
"For Target's Shoppers, a New Holiday To-Do List","Target confirmed on Thursday that hackers gained access to credit card and debit card information for 40 million of its customers during the crush of the holiday shopping season. The company encouraged everyone who shopped in its United States stores from Nov. 27 through Dec. 15 to be vigilant about monitoring their accounts and their credit. Here are some tips on how to do so. Q. If you shopped at Target during that period, what should you do now?  A. The first thing you should do is go online and check your credit card or bank statement. If everything looks fine, make a note to go back and check the statements again every few days. If you see suspicious charges, contact your credit card company or your financial institution right away. Q. What should you look for, and for how long? A. With lots of extra purchases being made for the holidays, this can be a tricky time of year to remember what you bought, so it's important to be extra vigilant. According to John Ulzheimer, a consumer credit expert for Credit Sesame, the ''smart fraudster'' won't go out and buy a dozen big-screen TVs. They will make small purchases, like something for $29, at an inconspicuous venue like a drugstore, to try to avoid any notice. ''What that does is it lets them know they've got a valid card that's still in play, and then they can pepper you to death with it,'' Mr. Ulzheimer said. ''So even if it's a small dollar amount, it doesn't hurt to verify to make sure it was really you.'' A thief might also sit on the card information for a period of months, maybe even years, Mr. Ulzheimer said, waiting for an initial spurt of vigilance to subside, so it is important to pay attention in the long run. Q. If a thief makes a purchase, will I be liable? A. In most cases, federal law limits consumer liability to a maximum of $50 in the case of credit card fraud. The ceiling for debit card liability is higher, up to $500. Another concern, according to Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, is that if money is drained from a consumer's bank account, it can take weeks for the victim to be made whole again. This can cause a great deal of strain for somebody without a financial cushion. Q. Should I cancel my credit or debit card? A. While Mr. Ulzheimer says that at this juncture, people do not need to cancel their cards, other experts disagree. Eva Velasquez, chief executive of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps victims of identity theft, suggests that people who shopped at Target when the data was breached cancel their credit card and get a new one. If shoppers used a debit card, she said they should get a new card and change their PIN -- PINs should be changed periodically anyway, so now is a good time to do it. Q. How do I monitor for identify theft? A. While experts emphasize that a data breach and identify theft are different, Ms. Velasquez says that the former can increase your chances of the latter. You can receive a free annual credit report from each of the three major reporting bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com. You can also add a 90-day fraud alert to your credit file so creditors will know to take extra precautions before approving any credit applications. Often, Mr. Ulzheimer said, companies that have experienced similar breaches will buy credit monitoring services for affected customers. And people who think they may have been affected can also sign up for free credit monitoring. The most aggressive thing you can do is put a freeze on your credit, which will make it impossible for anyone -- including you -- to open new lines of credit. But this can be inconvenient, Ms. Velasquez said, and is not always something that can be undone immediately. Q. Is it safe to shop at Target now? A. While Ms. Velasquez says that at this early stage, the answer to that question is a personal decision, others, like Mr. Ulzheimer, say it is perfectly safe to go ahead and do so. If you use cash, experts agree that the answer is yes. "
Hacktivists As Gadflies,"Around 400 B.C., Socrates was brought to trial on charges of corrupting the youth of Athens and ''impiety.'' Presumably, however, people believed then as we do now, that Socrates' real crime was being too clever and, not insignificantly, a royal pain to those in power or, as Plato put it, a gadfly. Just as a gadfly is an insect that could sting a horse and prod it into action, so too could Socrates sting the state. He challenged the moral values of his contemporaries and refused to go along with unjust demands of tyrants, often obstructing their plans when he could. Socrates thought his service to Athens should have earned him free dinners for life. He was given a cup of hemlock instead. We have had gadflies among us ever since, but one contemporary breed in particular has come in for a rough time of late: the ''hacktivist.'' While none have yet been forced to drink hemlock, the state has come down on them with remarkable force. This is in large measure evidence of how poignant, and troubling, their message has been.  Hacktivists, roughly speaking, are individuals who redeploy and repurpose technology for social causes. In this sense they are different from garden-variety hackers out to enrich only themselves. People like Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Bill Gates began their careers as hackers -- they repurposed technology, but without any particular political agenda. In the case of Mr. Jobs and Mr. Wozniak, they built and sold ''blue boxes,'' devices that allowed users to defraud the phone company. Today, of course, these people are establishment heroes, and the contrast between their almost exalted state and the scorn being heaped upon hacktivists is instructive. For some reason, it seems that the government considers hackers who are out to line their pockets less of a threat than those who are trying to make a political point. Consider the case of Andrew Auernheimer, better known as ''Weev.'' When Weev discovered in 2010 that AT&T had left private information about its customers vulnerable on the Internet, he and a colleague wrote a script to access it. Technically, he did not ''hack'' anything; he merely executed a simple version of what Google Web crawlers do every second of every day -- sequentially walk through public URLs and extract the content. When he got the information (the e-mail addresses of 114,000 iPad users, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Rahm Emanuel, then the White House chief of staff), Weev did not try to profit from it; he notified the blog Gawker of the security hole. For this service Weev might have asked for free dinners for life, but instead he was recently sentenced to 41 months in prison and ordered to pay a fine of more than $73,000 in damages to AT&T to cover the cost of notifying its customers of its own security failure. When the federal judge Susan Wigenton sentenced Weev on March 18, she described him with prose that could have been lifted from the prosecutor Meletus in Plato's ''Apology.'' ''You consider yourself a hero of sorts,'' she said, and noted that Weev's ''special skills'' in computer coding called for a more draconian sentence. I was reminded of a line from an essay written in 1986 by a hacker called the Mentor: ''My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.'' When offered the chance to speak, Weev, like Socrates, did not back down: ''I don't come here today to ask for forgiveness. I'm here to tell this court, if it has any foresight at all, that it should be thinking about what it can do to make amends to me for the harm and the violence that has been inflicted upon my life.'' He then went on to heap scorn upon the law being used to put him away -- the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the same law that prosecutors used to go after the 26-year-old Internet activist Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide in January. The law, as interpreted by the prosecutors, makes it a felony to use a computer system for ''unintended'' applications, or even violate a terms-of-service agreement. That would theoretically make a felon out of anyone who lied about their age or weight on Match.com. The case of Weev is not an isolated one. Barrett Brown, a journalist who had achieved some level of notoriety as the ''the former unofficial not-spokesman for Anonymous,'' the hacktivist group, now sits in federal custody in Texas. Mr. Brown came under the scrutiny of the authorities when he began poring over documents that had been released in the hack of two private security companies, HBGary Federal and Stratfor. Mr. Brown did not take part in the hacks, but he did become obsessed with the contents that emerged from them -- in particular the extracted documents showed that private security contractors were being hired by the United States government to develop strategies for undermining protesters and journalists, including Glenn Greenwald, a columnist for Salon. Since the cache was enormous, Mr. Brown thought he might crowdsource the effort and copied and pasted the URL from an Anonymous chat server to a Web site called Project PM, which was under his control. Just to be clear, what Mr. Brown did was repost the URL from a Web site that was publicly available on the Internet. Because Stratfor had not encrypted the credit card information of its clients, the information in the cache included credit card numbers and validation numbers. Mr. Brown didn't extract the numbers or highlight them; he merely offered a link to the database. For this he was charged on 12 counts, all of which pertained to credit card fraud. The charges against him add up to about 100 years in federal prison. It was ''virtually impossible,'' Mr. Greenwald, wrote recently in The Guardian, his new employer, ''to conclude that the obscenely excessive prosecution he now faces is unrelated to that journalism and his related activism.'' Other hacktivists have felt the force of the United States government in recent months, and all reflect an alarming contrast between the severity of the punishment and the flimsiness of the actual charges. The case of Aaron Swartz has been well documented. Jeremy Hammond, who reportedly played a direct role in the Stratfor and HBGary hacks, has been in jail for more than a year awaiting trial. Mercedes Haefer, a journalism student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, faces charges for hosting an Internet Relay Chat channel where an Anonymous denial of service attack was planned. Most recently, Matthew Keys, a 26-year-old social-media editor at Reuters, who allegedly assisted hackers associated with Anonymous (who reportedly then made a prank change to a Los Angeles Times headline), was indicted on federal charges that could result in more than $750,000 in fines and prison time, inciting a new outcry against the law and its overly harsh enforcement. The list goes on. In a world in which nearly everyone is technically a felon, we rely on the good judgment of prosecutors to decide who should be targets and how hard the law should come down on them. We have thus entered a legal reality not so different from that faced by Socrates when the Thirty Tyrants ruled Athens, and it is a dangerous one. When everyone is guilty of something, those most harshly prosecuted tend to be the ones that are challenging the established order, poking fun at the authorities, speaking truth to power -- in other words, the gadflies of our society.

Skepticism Over U.S. Involvement in Foreign Conflicts,"WASHINGTON -- Americans are increasingly skeptical about whether the United States should thrust itself into conflicts overseas, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, but that reluctance does not extend to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. After 12 years of war and amid signs of a sustainable economic recovery, nearly six in 10 people said the United States should not take a leading role among all other countries in trying to solve conflicts, the poll found, while only about a third said it should remain at the forefront.  On Iran, however, the same proportion of people -- 58 percent -- favored the United States taking military action to stop Iran from manufacturing a bomb, an action that President Obama has repeatedly warned the Iranian government is a ''red line'' for the United States. The support for a more restrained American role has grown markedly since the question was last asked, in April 2003, a month after the invasion of Iraq. And it suggests Mr. Obama is in tune with the public mood in his refusal to be drawn into the bloody civil war in Syria. ''We don't have the finances for it, we have problems of our own, and we have to solve our own issues before we take on everyone else's problems,'' Michael Burt, 54, of Creedmoor, N.C., who worked in hotel security but is now on disability leave, said in a follow-up interview. Even as Americans signal a desire to draw inward, however, they appear sensitive to the nation's growing vulnerability to attacks on its computer systems. An overwhelming majority said cyberattacks were a very serious or somewhat serious threat, with nearly six in 10 saying the United States is not adequately prepared for them. More than half of Americans said the United States should never conduct cyberattacks against another country, while about a third said such attacks should be carried out. The Bush and Obama administrations, working with the Israelis, have made covert attacks against Iran's nuclear program. For Mr. Obama, who shuffled his national-security ranks this week by naming Susan E. Rice as national security adviser, the poll brought a mixed verdict on foreign policy. Forty-five percent approved of his stewardship and 39 percent disapproved. The administration's handling of the attack on the mission in Benghazi, Libya, continues to cast a shadow. Fifty-three percent of people said it was ''mostly hiding something'' about the attack, while 34 percent said it was ''mostly telling the truth.'' At the same time, people were cynical about the motives of Republicans in denouncing administration officials, including Ms. Rice, over Benghazi. Nearly six in 10 said the criticisms were mainly for political reasons, as opposed to a search for the truth. When people were quizzed about the level of American engagement in April 2003, 48 percent said the United States should take the lead, while 43 percent said it should not. In the latest poll, only 35 percent said it should take the lead; 58 percent said it should not. The evolution of those attitudes is in line with some of the ideas that Mr. Obama laid out last month for how the United States should handle counterterrorism in the post-9/11 era -- a strategy that continues to rely on the use of drones. Seventy-two percent of people supported using drones to kill terrorism suspects, though there was significant concern that they kill innocent people and are not subject to adequate oversight. Mr. Obama's renewed promise to close the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and transfer the inmates found little support, however. Fifty-eight percent of people said it should remain open, while only 34 percent said it should be closed. The telephone poll was conducted on both landlines and cellphones from May 31 to June 4 with 1,022 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. "
The Pentagon as Incubator,"SAN FRANCISCO -- In the ranks of technology incubator programs, there is AngelPad here in San Francisco and Y Combinator about 40 miles south in Mountain View. And then there is the Pentagon. In the last year, former Department of Defense and intelligence agency operatives have headed to Silicon Valley to create technology start-ups specializing in tools aimed at thwarting online threats. Frequent reports of cyberattacks have expanded the demand for security tools, in both the public and private sectors, and venture capital money has followed. In 2012, more than $1 billion in venture financing poured into security start-ups, more than double the amount in 2010, according to the National Venture Capital Association. For years, the Pentagon has knocked on Silicon Valley's door in search of programmers to work on its spying technologies. But these days, it's the Pentagon that is being scouted for expertise. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists are finding it valuable to have an insider's perspective on the national security apparatus when trying to find or prevent computer vulnerabilities or mine large troves of data.  ''They have unique insights because they've been on the front line,'' said Matthew Howard, a former intelligence analyst in the Navy and now a managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners, referring to former military and intelligence operatives who have hatched start-ups. He has invested in several such companies. ''Now they've got commercial desires. The lines are blurring.'' One of the start-ups is Synack, which promises to vet an army of hackers to hunt for security vulnerabilities in the computer systems of government agencies and private companies. The company's co-founders, Jay Kaplan and Mark Kuhr, met in Fort Meade, Md., in the counterterrorism division of the National Security Agency. They left the agency in February after four years there, and later decamped to Silicon Valley. Within weeks, they had raised $1.5 million in seed money; they are now working with their first customers and pitching their experience in the spy agency. ''Doing things on a classified level really opens your eyes,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''The government is doing a lot of interesting things they don't disclose. You have a unique perspective on what the adversary is doing and the state of computer security at a whole other level.'' Morta Security, another of the start-ups, was founded by Raj Shah, a former F-16 fighter pilot for the Air Force in Iraq. He described himself as ''a policy adviser'' to the N.S.A. before moving to Silicon Valley to establish the company this year with two former analysts. Morta's work is in such ''stealth mode,'' in valley parlance, that the company has said nothing about what it is working on. Nor would Mr. Shah describe fully what his two co-founders were doing at the agency before they formed the company. ''There are very sophisticated threats that are able to steal data from corporations and government,'' is all Mr. Shah would say. ''Our guys' background -- they just have a deeper understanding of that problem.'' Though Silicon Valley sees itself as an industry far removed from the Beltway, the two power centers have had a longstanding symbiotic relationship. And some say the cozy personal connections of ex-intelligence operatives to the military could invite abuse, like the divulging of private information to former colleagues in the agencies. ''They have enormous opportunities to cash in on their Washington experience, sometimes in ways that fund further innovation and other times in ways that might be very troubling to many people,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. ''Both sides like to maintain a myth of distant relations. The ties have been in place for a long time.'' The ties are more than personal; the National Security Agency is among the few organizations in the world, along with companies like Facebook and Google, with a cadre of engineers trained in mining big data. By working at the N.S.A., ''you get to be on the bleeding edge, not just the cutting edge of what's possible,'' said Oren Falkowitz, who left the agency last year to start Sqrrl, a big data analytics company based on technology developed at the agency. Mr. Falkowitz has since left Sqrrl, which is in Boston, and is considering moving to Northern California to start working with a big data company. Last year, Sumit Agarwal left his post as a deputy assistant secretary of defense to join Shape Security, a Mountain View company that offers what it calls ''military grade'' security solutions against botnets, groups of infected computers used for attacks. Shape Security's chief executive is Derek Smith, a former Pentagon consultant whose last company, Oakley Networks, which specialized in detecting insider threats, was sold to Raytheon, the military contractor, in 2007. Since its inception in 2011, Shape Security has raised $26 million in venture financing. Computer security experts are leaving other parts of government for start-ups, too. Sameer Bhalotra, who worked on cybersecurity issues at the White House, was recruited by a Redwood City-based security company called Impermium. And Shawn Henry, a former computer security specialist from the F.B.I., left his job in government last year to help establish CrowdStrike, a computer security firm. In Israel, government security workers have long found a career path in moving to start-ups, said Peter Wagner, a partner at a recently opened venture firm, Wing Venture Partners, in Menlo Park. Many Israeli entrepreneurs come out of the Israeli military and intelligence services, he pointed out. ''It's not surprising that some of the same type of experience is finding its way into entrepreneurial endeavors here in the U.S.,'' Mr. Wagner said. The idea for Synack came to its founders, Mr. Kuhr, 29, and Mr. Kaplan, 27, when they were working side by side at the N.S.A.'s computer network operations division; within the agency, that includes figuring out how to attack or exploit data gathered from a computer network. Nights and weekends, they hatched their business plan. They proposed to assemble an army of vetted bounty hunters from around the world to find security bugs. Their product is a variation of the so-called bug bounty programs run by large companies, like Facebook and Microsoft, that in effect invite security researchers to try to crack vulnerabilities in their systems -- and reward them if they do. Part of their pitch to potential customers is that they will vet the bounty hunters before setting them loose. They hope to sign up government agencies as customers, along with private firms, especially in the software services sector. ''We are able to provide security experts previously inaccessible to companies,'' Mr. Kaplan added. Both men's college educations were paid for by N.S.A. scholarships -- Mr. Kaplan at George Washington University, Mr. Kuhr at West Point Military Academy and then at Auburn University. With that came an obligation to work at the agency, which they did, each for four years. ''We really liked our jobs there,'' Mr. Kuhr said. Then they headed west, drawn by the same dream of riches that draws so many other people here. "
Daily Report: Luring Young Web Warriors Is a U.S. Priority. It's Also a Game.,"In the eighth grade, Arlan Jaska figured out how to write a simple script that could switch his keyboard's Caps Lock key on and off 6,000 times a minute. When friends weren't looking, he slipped his program onto their computers. It was all fun and games until the program spread to his middle school.  ""They called my parents and told my dad I was hacking their computers,"" Mr. Jaska, now 17, recalled. He was grounded and got detention. And he is just the type the Department of Homeland Security is looking for, Nicole Perlroth writes on Monday in The New York Times. The secretary of that agency, Janet Napolitano, knows she has a problem that will only worsen. Foreign hackers have been attacking her agency's computer systems. They have also been busy trying to siphon the nation's wealth and steal valuable trade secrets. And they have begun probing the nation's infrastructure - the power grid and water and transportation systems. So she needs her own hackers - 600, the agency estimates. But potential recruits with the right skills have too often been heading for business, and those who do choose government work often go to the National Security Agency, where they work on offensive digital strategies. At Homeland Security, the emphasis is on keeping hackers out, or playing defense. ""We have to show them how cool and exciting this is,"" said Ed Skoudis, one of the nation's top computer security trainers. ""And we have to show them that applying these skills to the public sector is important."" One answer? Start young, and make it a game, even a contest. This month, Mr. Jaska and his classmate Collin Berman took top spots at the Virginia Governor's Cup Cyber Challenge, a veritable smackdown of hacking for high school students that was the brainchild of Alan Paller, a security expert, and others in the field. With military exercises like NetWars, the competition had more the feel of a video game. Mr. Paller helped create the competition, the first in a series, to help Homeland Security, and likens the agency's need for hackers to the shortage of fighter pilots during World War II. The job calls for a certain maverick attitude. ""I like to break things,"" Mr. Berman, 18, said. ""I always want to know, 'How can I change this so it does something else?' ""  "
HTC Settles Privacy Case Over Flaws In Phones,"WASHINGTON -- More than 18 million smartphones and other mobile devices made by HTC, a Taiwanese company that is one of the largest sellers of smartphones in the United States, had security flaws that could allow location tracking of users against their will and the theft of personal information stored on their phones, federal officials said Friday. The Federal Trade Commission charged HTC with customizing the software on its Android- and Windows-based phones in ways that let third-party applications install software that could steal personal information, surreptitiously send text messages or enable the device's microphone to record the user's phone calls.  The action is the first attempt by the commission to police a manufacturer of mobile devices. As smartphones and tablets become a common way for consumers to shop, bank and chat online, personal information and privacy will need to be guarded. HTC America, based in Bellevue, Wash., agreed to settle the civil suit with the commission by issuing software patches that close the security holes, and by creating a security program that will be monitored by an independent party for the next 20 years. The F.T.C. does not have the authority to assess fines in consumer protection cases. ''The company didn't design its products with security in mind,'' Lesley Fair, a senior lawyer in the commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, wrote in a blog post. ''HTC didn't test the software on its mobile devices for potential security vulnerabilities, didn't follow commonly accepted secure coding practices and didn't even respond when warned about the flaws in its devices.'' An HTC official said Friday that the company had already started to update its software and distribute it to users of some, but not all, of the affected phones. ''Working with our carrier partners, we have addressed the identified security vulnerabilities on the majority of devices in the U.S. released after December 2010,'' Sally Julien, an HTC spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''We're working to roll out the remaining software updates now and recommend customers download them once available.'' ''Privacy and security are important,'' the statement added, ''and we are committed to improving practices that help safeguard our customers' devices and data.'' The trade commission charged that the security flaws resulted from HTC's modifying the operating system software used on most of the affected phones. In the case of Android, created by Google, the system is designed to protect sensitive information and phone functions through what is known as a permission-based security model. That requires a user, when installing an application that is not a standard part of the operating system, to be notified and to agree that the application could gain access to certain information or functions. HTC, however, preinstalled certain apps on its phones in a way that, in addition to preventing consumers from removing them, disabled the permission-based model and allowed newly installed apps to have immediate access to personal data. ''The analogy isn't exact,'' wrote Ms. Fair of the F.T.C., ''but it's like giving a friend the combination to a safe only to find out he's handing it over to anyone who asks.'' That security hole could, for example, let the rogue software secretly record users' phone conversations or track their location. Flaws in the security system could also give third-party apps access to phone numbers, contents of text messages, browsing history and information like credit card numbers and banking transactions. Those flaws also affected HTC phones that used Windows-based operating systems. While HTC's actions introduced numerous security vulnerabilities to its phones, a commission official said it was not clear how many users experienced illegal incursions into their phones and personal information. The flaw in the company's phones has been known since at least 2011. HTC acknowledged the problems at that time and developed software patches for at least some of the deficiencies that year. But the problems were far from minor. The F.T.C. said that text-message toll fraud, in which a hacker causes a phone to send text messages to a number that charges the user for delivery of the message, ''is one of the most common types of Android malware,'' or malicious software. HTC's user manuals either said or implied that a user was protected against malware because of the permission-based security, the commission said. The commission will collect public comments on the proposed remedies for 30 days, after which it will decide whether to formally carry out the order. If HTC subsequently violates the order's restrictions and requirements, it faces civil penalties of up to $16,000 a violation. "
U.S. and China Will Hold Talks About Hacking,"WASHINGTON -- The United States and China have agreed to hold regular, high-level talks on how to set standards of behavior for cybersecurity and commercial espionage, the first diplomatic effort to defuse the tensions over what the United States says is a daily barrage of computer break-ins and theft of corporate and government secrets. The talks will begin in July. Next Friday, President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, who took office this spring, are scheduled to hold an unusual, informal summit meeting in Rancho Mirage, Calif., that could set the tone for their relationship and help them confront chronic tensions like the nuclear threat from North Korea. American officials say they do not expect the process to immediately yield a significant reduction in the daily intrusions from China. The head of the United States Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, has said the attacks have resulted in the ''greatest transfer of wealth in history.'' Hackers have stolen a variety of secrets, including negotiating strategies and schematics for next-generation fighter jets and gas pipeline control systems.  Nonetheless, a senior American official involved in the negotiations to hold regular meetings said in an interview on Friday that ''we need to get some norms and rules.'' ''It is a serious issue that cannot simply be swatted away with talking points,'' said the official, who noted that the meetings would focus primarily on the theft of intellectual property from American companies. ''Our concerns are not limited to that, but that's what needs urgent attention,'' he added. The Chinese government has insisted it is a victim of cyberattacks, not a perpetrator, and Chinese officials have vigorously denied the extensive evidence gathered by the Pentagon and private security experts that a unit of the People's Liberation Army, Unit 61398 outside Shanghai, is behind many of the most sophisticated attacks on the United States. On Saturday, after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke of a ''growing threat of cyberintrusions'' at a conference in Singapore, in comments directed at China, a Chinese general gave a tart response saying she doubted the United States' assurances that its growing military presence in Asia was not directed at China. While cyberattacks will be a major subject of the talks in Rancho Mirage, at an estate that belonged to Walter Annenberg, the main effort will be to forge a rapport between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi. American officials hope the estate, known as Sunnylands, which has played host to American presidents and foreign dignitaries dating to Richard M. Nixon, will put both men at ease. American officials said they have been surprised by the pace at which Mr. Xi, a longtime party functionary who consolidated his grip on power in March, has installed new faces in the Chinese leadership and moved to take greater control over the military, something his predecessor, Hu Jintao, never mastered. Another main issue at the meeting will be North Korea. American officials, emerging from talks with Mr. Xi and his team, believe that the new Chinese leader has less patience for North Korea and little of the sentimental attachment to its leaders that his predecessors had. ''What's interesting here is the dog that isn't barking,'' the American official said. The Chinese, he noted, are not urging all sides to resume talks until the North Koreans agree that the objective is removing all nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula. ''We're not hearing the soothing mantra of restraint,'' he said. The Chinese have also taken public steps to confront North Korea, like ordering the Bank of China to stop dealing with North Korea's largest foreign-exchange bank. ''They're much more open to causing pain to North Korea,'' said Jeffrey A. Bader, a top China adviser to Mr. Obama until 2011. Still, during the latest round of the Korea crisis this spring, Kim Jong-un, the young and largely untested new North Korean leader, made it clear that he had no intention of ever giving up his small arsenal. Cybersecurity issues loom large between the United States and China because they go to the heart of the economic relationship between the two countries, even more so now that previous sources of friction, like China's foreign exchange policies, have eased in the last year. Chinese academics and industrialists say that if China is to maintain its annual economic growth rate of 7 or 8 percent, it needs a steady inflow of new technology. That could make the Chinese reluctant to cut back on the systematic theft of intellectual property. In return, the Chinese will press the Americans on their use of cyberweapons: while there is no evidence that they have been used against Chinese targets, the sophisticated cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear program by the United States and Israel are often cited by the Chinese news media and military journals as evidence that Washington, too, uses cyberspace for strategic advantage. The talks over computer hacking will start as part of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, an annual meeting of Chinese and American officials on a broad range of issues. But a new working group is being organized on the subject that will meet more frequently, officials say. Where the talks will lead, however, is unclear: after considerable debate within the Obama administration, officials have concluded that online conflict does not lend itself to the kind of arms control treaties that the United States and the Soviet Union began negotiating 50 years ago. Today, cyberweapons are held by private individuals as well as states, and figuring out where an attack began can be maddeningly difficult. Another problem, China experts said, is that neither the Americans nor the Chinese are well prepared for a candid discussion of cyberissues. The growth of hacking, and its use in both military and corporate espionage, is a new enough phenomenon that it is not clear how seriously Mr. Xi and other senior Chinese leaders view it. Tung Chee-hwa, a former chief executive of Hong Kong who has close ties to China's leaders, said recently that when he raises the American concerns about hacking with senior officials in Beijing, they express puzzlement. And neither side, experts said, is ready to discuss military espionage, which means the conversation will necessarily focus on the theft of corporate secrets by China-based hackers. On that subject, they said, Mr. Obama needs to be unyielding. ''Obama has got to say, 'You've got a major hacking operation under way in Beijing, you've got a major hacking operation under way in Shanghai. This is going to have repercussions if we don't see changes very quickly,' '' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China adviser in the Clinton administration who is now at the Brookings Institution. China and the United States, experts say, could find common ground on the need to stop cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure, like the electrical grid, since it poses such a danger to both countries. ''I personally think a bilateral 'no sabotage' pledge would be a very good idea,'' Mr. Bader said. "
Belgium: NATO Sends Team to Libya To Assess Providing Security Aid,"BRUSSELS -- NATO is sending a team of experts to Libya to assess how the alliance can provide security assistance, notably military training, to help the turbulent North African nation combat Islamist militants claiming allegiance to Al Qaeda and other threats. Libya has been bedeviled by instability since a NATO air campaign helped topple the country's longtime dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in 2011. The pledge to help Libya's fragile new government came as Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and other NATO defense ministers began a two-day meeting in Brussels focused largely on Afghanistan and cybersecurity.  The NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said at a news conference that a team of experts would visit Libya ''as soon as possible'' and report back by the end of June. He said that providing security assistance ''would be a fitting way to continue our cooperation with Libya after we successfully took action to protect the Libyan people two years ago.'' The overthrow of Colonel Qaddafi's autocratic government has left the new government struggling to fill a security vacuum. Last September, Islamist militants attacked the United States Mission in Benghazi, resulting in the death of the American ambassador and three of his colleagues, an episode that created a political firestorm in Washington over whether security issues were taken seriously enough and how President Obama's administration responded. Mr. Rasmussen, who discussed Libya last Friday in Washington with Mr. Obama, said Tuesday in Brussels that any security assistance would aim to beef up Libya's own security forces and would not involve sending NATO troops to the country. ''Let me stress, this is not about deploying troops to Libya,'' said Mr. Rasmussen, who added that the country had made a formal request for help last week. He said that any training of military forces ''could take place outside Libya.'' Prime Minister Ali Zeidan of Libya visited NATO headquarters in Brussels early last week and said that the alliance had agreed to provide ''technical assistance in terms of training.'' He provided no additional details. Libya has been wracked by insecurity since the overthrow of Colonel Qaddafi in the summer of 2011, when NATO declared a no-fly zone and sent warplanes to assist anti-Qaddafi rebels. The growing role of Islamist fighters is a source of special concern to Washington. They have become particularly active in southern Libya, where militants have taken refuge after being driven out of Mali by a French-led offensive earlier this year. The first day of the NATO defense ministers' meeting, however, centered on the threat posed by attacks on the alliance's computer systems. ""Cyberattacks are getting more common, more complex and more dangerous,'' Mr. Rasmussen told reporters. ''They come without warning from anywhere in the world and they can have devastating consequences.'' He said that NATO had ''dealt with'' more than 2,500 ''significant cases'' last year. ''That is one every three hours, day and night, every day of the year,'' Mr. Rasmussen said. But he added that ''despite the increasing sophistication of these attacks, our security has not been compromised.'' He did not specify where the attacks originated. The NATO secretary general also raised what in recent years has become a perennial complaint at gatherings of the alliance: the shrinking defense budgets of many European nations. Washington has repeatedly pleaded with its allies to beef up their defense budgets but, with much of Europe mired in a deep economic slump, the downward slide has largely continued. ''European countries must do more to relieve the unequal burden that is currently being carried by the United States,'' Mr. Rasmussen said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Obama and Xi Tackle Cybersecurity as Talks Begin in California,"PALM SPRINGS, Calif. -- President Obama, midway through much-anticipated weekend talks with President Xi Jinping of China, said Friday night that there was no parallel between the cyberattacks on American businesses and government interests that it blames on China and the United States government's surveillance of phone and Internet traffic to foil terrorists. Mr. Xi sidestepped a question from a reporter about whether China was complicit in the hacking of America systems, and countered that his country was also a victim of cyberattacks. Both presidents said their countries and others must work to develop what Mr. Obama called ''common rules'' for cybersecurity to protect economies and militaries globally. ''In some ways these are uncharted waters, and we don't have the kind of protocols that have governed military issues and arms issues, where nations have a lot of experience in trying to negotiate what's acceptable and what's not,'' Mr. Obama added.  The two presidents spoke to reporters after three hours of relatively informal discussions at a secluded desert retreat here and before a working dinner. They are to meet for a final session on Saturday morning, completing an unusually informal get-together that reflects the personal ties each leader is trying to foster. Officials said the first session was focused on the security issues that bedevil both leaders and one -- North Korea's nuclear threat -- that the United States sees as a chance to foster greater cooperation with China. On Saturday, the presidents plan to delve into economic issues, a category that includes cybersecurity because of businesses' concerns about actual and threatened theft of their commercial secrets and other intellectual property. Before the talks began, both leaders pledged to use their meetings to take the relationship between their countries to a new, more cooperative level despite new tensions over cybersecurity. Mr. Xi proclaimed ''a new historical starting point,'' 40 years after the opening of relations. Mr. Obama said, ''I think that both of us agree that continuous and candid and constructive conversation and communication is critically important to shaping our relationship for years to come.'' . He added, ''The United States welcomes the continuing peaceful rise of China as a world power and that, in fact, it is in the United States' interest that China continues on the path of success, because we believe that a peaceful and stable and prosperous China is not only good for Chinese but also good for the world and for the United States.'' Mr. Xi, reflecting his country's increasing sense of its global power as it defines its stance toward the United States, said the question they face is: ''How can our two nations join together to promote peace and development in the world? These are things that not just the people in our two countries are watching closely, but the whole world is also watching very closely.'' ''We need to think creatively and act energetically so that working together we can build a new model of major-country relationship,'' he added. After their opening statements, Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi, along with their interpreters and closest aides, retreated to the comfort of the sprawling Sunnylands estate in nearby Rancho Mirage, built by the publishing magnate Walter H. Annenberg. But Mr. Obama could not completely escape the domestic controversy over the federal government's surveillance of domestic phone records and foreign Internet traffic, despite his attempt early on Friday to dampen the furor with an emphatic public defense of the antiterrorism tactics. White House officials said they did not know why someone had leaked details about the surveillance programs, though they said they did not think they were timed to sabotage the Obama-Xi talks here. A spokesman for Mr. Obama, Josh Earnest, dismissed suggestions from reporters flying with the president to Palm Springs that the surveillance flap would undercut Mr. Obama's efforts to pressure his counterpart on human rights and civil liberties within China. Mr. Earnest even suggested that the intensity of the current debate in the United States could serve as a good example to the Chinese. ''This is a pretty good illustration of type of conversation we want to have about respecting civil liberties and protecting the constitutional rights of the people that you govern,'' he said. The surveillance limits and privacy protections that Mr. Obama instituted when he took office, Mr. Earnest added, ''constrained his own ability, constrained his own authority.'' ''I think that is a testament to the strength of our system of government,'' he said. The reaction from China, where Internet surveillance is a basic fact of life, seemed muted. Some Chinese dissidents who view the United States as a symbol of political tolerance were initially surprised but also said they understood the reasons cited for the American surveillance. ''I think the main difference is that in China surveillance is done for the interests of the Communist Party, with no legal basis or limits at all, to monitor dissidents,'' said Hu Jia, a prominent dissident in Beijing who often uses Skype, Twitter and other Internet tools. ''In the U.S. case, I think this was used to fight terror.'' Chen Yongmiao, a rights advocate and former lawyer in Beijing, said he would not be any more worried about using the Internet now. ''I think these days all governments do this kind of thing, and it's a matter of whether there are any limits or legal restraints,'' he said. ''Of course, the use of government powers should be transparent and accountable, and when the U.S. government isn't and it's exposed, then the government will pay a price. On the other hand, China does not have any mechanisms like that.'' Another issue expected to figure prominently in the talks between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi is the tension with North Korea that has been inflamed this year by a series of belligerent statements and actions from the North's young leader, Kim Jong-un. The Obama administration has welcomed what officials have described as a growing impatience in China -- on the part of Mr. Xi in particular -- with its longstanding ally in Pyongyang. That has raised administration hopes of new cooperation. China voted with the rest of the United Nations Security Council to impose new sanctions on North Korea after it tested a nuclear device in February. And when a close adviser to Mr. Kim visited China last month, Mr. Xi bluntly told him that North Korea should resume international negotiations intended to force it to abandon its nuclear arsenal. Mr. Xi also appears to have invested heavily in the meetings here with Mr. Obama. Mr. Xi, who took office in March, told Mr. Obama's departing national security adviser, Tom Donilon, who arranged the meetings, that the relationship between the United States and China had reached a critical juncture and that he wanted to develop ''a new type of great power relationship.'' Some Chinese diplomats had grumbled that Mr. Xi should not have agreed to meet in California since it was Mr. Obama's turn to visit China, according to a person who attended a briefing at China's Foreign Ministry ahead of the meeting. But Mr. Xi himself dispensed with the strict protocol of alternating leaders' visits. China also offered its own gestures in advance of the Sunnylands summit meeting on one of the prickliest issues with the United States: its treatment of human rights. On Friday, only hours before the two leaders met, China granted passports to the mother and brother of Chen Guangcheng, the blind lawyer and activist whose flight from China last year turned into a diplomatic drama between the two countries. The day before, Mr. Chen had joined the relatives of prominent imprisoned dissidents and 30 American and international rights organizations in Washington in calling on Mr. Obama to appeal vigorously for their release and to press Mr. Xi more broadly to respect democratic freedoms.

"After Profits, Defense Contractor Faces the Pitfalls of Cybersecurity","WASHINGTON -- When the United Arab Emirates wanted to create its own version of the National Security Agency, it turned to Booz Allen Hamilton to replicate the world's largest and most powerful spy agency in the sands of Abu Dhabi. It was a natural choice: The chief architect of Booz Allen's cyberstrategy is Mike McConnell, who once led the N.S.A. and pushed the United States into a new era of big data espionage. It was Mr. McConnell who won the blessing of the American intelligence agencies to bolster the Persian Gulf sheikdom, which helps track the Iranians. ''They are teaching everything,'' one Arab official familiar with the effort said. ''Data mining, Web surveillance, all sorts of digital intelligence collection.'' Yet as Booz Allen profits handsomely from its worldwide expansion, Mr. McConnell and other executives of the government contractor -- which sells itself as the gold standard in protecting classified computer systems and boasts that half its 25,000 employees have Top Secret clearances -- have a lot of questions to answer.  Among the questions: Why did Booz Allen assign a 29-year-old with scant experience to a sensitive N.S.A. site in Hawaii, where he was left loosely supervised as he downloaded highly classified documents about the government's monitoring of Internet and telephone communications, apparently loading them onto a portable memory stick barred by the agency? The results could be disastrous for a company that until a week ago had one of the best business plans in Washington, with more than half its $5.8 billion in annual revenue coming from the military and the intelligence agencies. Last week, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, whom Mr. McConnell regularly briefed when he was in government, suggested for the first time that companies like Booz Allen should lose their broad access to the most sensitive intelligence secrets. ''We will certainly have legislation which will limit or prevent contractors from handling highly classified and technical data,'' said Ms. Feinstein, a California Democrat. Senior White House officials said they agreed. Yet cutting contractors out of classified work is a lot harder in practice than in theory. Booz Allen is one of many companies that make up the digital spine of the intelligence world, designing the software and hardware systems on which the N.S.A. and other military and intelligence agencies depend. Mr. McConnell speaks often about the need for the private sector to jolt the government out of its attachment to existing systems, noting, for example, that the Air Force fought the concept of drones for years. Removing contractors from the classified world would be a wrenching change: Of the 1.4 million people with Top Secret clearances, more than a third are private contractors. (The background checks for those clearances are usually done by other contractors.) Mr. McConnell himself has been among the most vocal in warning about the risks to contractors. ''The defense industrial base needs to address security,'' he said in an interview with The New York Times last year, months before Booz Allen hired Edward J. Snowden, its young systems administrator who has admitted to leaking documents describing secret N.S.A. programs. ''It should be a condition for contracts. You cannot be competitive in the cyber era if you don't have a higher level of security.'' Booz Allen is saying little about Mr. Snowden's actions or the questions they have raised about its practices. Mr. McConnell, once among the most accessible intelligence officials in Washington, declined to be interviewed for this article. ''This has to hurt Mike's relationship with the N.S.A.,'' said a business associate of Mr. McConnell's who requested anonymity. ''He helped set up those contracts and is heavily engaged there.'' Indeed, few top officials in the intelligence world have become greater authorities on cyberconflict than the 69-year-old Mr. McConnell, who walks with a stoop from a bad back and speaks with the soft accent of his upbringing in Greenville, S.C. He began his career as a Navy intelligence officer on a small boat in the backwaters of the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. Years later he helped the American intelligence apparatus make the leap from an analog world of electronic eavesdropping to the new age of cyberweaponry. President Bill Clinton relied on Mr. McConnell as director of the N.S.A., a post he held from 1992 to 1996. He then moved to Booz Allen as a senior vice president, building its first cyberunits. But with the intelligence community in disarray after its failure to prevent the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the fiasco of nonexistent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the toll of constant reorganization, President George W. Bush asked him to be the second director of national intelligence from 2007 to 2009. That was when he made his biggest mark, forcing a reluctant bureaucracy to invest heavily in cybercapability and overseeing ''Olympic Games,'' the development of America's first truly sophisticated cyberweapon, which was used against Iran's nuclear enrichment program. When Mr. Bush needed someone to bring President-elect Barack Obama up to speed on every major intelligence program he was about to inherit, including drones and defenses against electronic intrusions from China, he handed the task to Mr. McConnell. But Mr. Obama was not interested in keeping the previous team, and Mr. McConnell returned to Booz Allen in 2009. He earned more than $4.1 million his first year back, and $2.3 million last year. He is now vice chairman, and the company describes him as the leader of its ''rapidly expanding cyberbusiness.'' In Washington he is often Booz Allen's public face, because of his ties to the intelligence agencies and his extensive and loyal network of federal intelligence officials who once worked with him. Two months ago, the company announced the creation of a Strategic Innovation Group, staffed by 1,500 employees who are pursuing, among other projects, one of Mr. McConnell's favorites: the development of ''predictive'' intelligence tools that its clients can use to scour the Web for anomalies in behavior and warn of terror or cyberattacks. He has also hired a senior counterterrorism official to market products in the Middle East. This year, the company began working on a $5.6 billion, five-year intelligence analysis program for the Defense Intelligence Agency. The company's profits are up almost eightfold since it went public in late 2010. Its majority shareholder is the Carlyle Group, which matches private equity with a lot of Washington power, and its executives, chief among them Mr. McConnell, drum up business by warning clients about the potential effects of cyberweapons. ''The digital capabilities are a little bit like W.M.D.'s,'' Mr. McConnell said in the interview last year. The good news, he said, is that countries like China and Russia recognize limits in using those weapons, and terror groups have been slow to master the technology. ''The people that would do us harm aren't yet in possession of them,'' he said. As director of national intelligence, Mr. McConnell kept a giant world map propped up in front of his desk. Countries were sized by Internet traffic, and the United States ballooned bigger than all others -- a fact that he told a visitor was at once ''a huge intelligence advantage and a huge vulnerability.'' The advantage was that the United States' role as the world's biggest Internet switching center gave it an opportunity to sort through the vast troves of metadata -- including phone records, Internet activity and banking transactions -- enabling analysts to search for anomalies and look for attacks in the making. But he chafed at the legislative restrictions that slowed the process. So in 2007, as the intelligence chief, he lobbied Congress for revisions to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to eliminate some of the most burdensome rules on the N.S.A., including that it obtain a warrant when spying on two foreigners abroad simply because they were using a wired connection that flowed through a computer server or switch inside the United States. It made no sense in the modern age, he argued. ''Now if it were wireless, we would not be required to get a warrant,'' he told The El Paso Times in August of that year. The resulting changes in both law and legal interpretations led to many of the steps -- including the government's collection of logs of telephone calls made in and out of the country -- that have been debated since Mr. Snowden began revealing the extent of such programs. Then Mr. McConnell put them into effect. In 2007, ''Mike came back into government with a 100-day plan and a 500-day plan for the intelligence community,'' said Stephen J. Hadley, Mr. Bush's national security adviser. ''He brought a real sense of the private sector to the intelligence world, and it needed it.'' The new technologies created a flood of new work for the intelligence agencies -- and huge opportunities for companies like Booz Allen. It hired thousands of young analysts like Mr. Snowden. The intelligence agencies snapped them up, assigning them to sensitive, understaffed locales, including the Hawaii listening station where Mr. Snowden downloaded his materials. Only last month, the Navy awarded Booz Allen, among others, the first contracts in a billion-dollar project to help with ''a new generation of intelligence, surveillance and combat operations.'' The new push is to take those skills to American allies, especially at a time of reduced spending in Washington. So while the contract with the United Arab Emirates is small, it may be a model for other countries that see cyberdefense -- and perhaps offense -- as their future. The company reported net income of $219 million in the fiscal year that ended on March 31. That was up from net income of $25 million in 2010, shortly after Mr. McConnell returned to the company. But the legal warnings at the end of its financial report offered a caution that the company could be hurt by ''any issue that compromises our relationships with the U.S. government or damages our professional reputation.''

Cybersecurity Acquisition,"Cisco Systems agreed on Tuesday to buy Sourcefire, a provider of cybersecurity services, for about $2.7 billion in cash, in a reflection of the growing fervor for companies that can help guard against computer-based attacks.  Under the terms of the deal, Cisco will pay $76 a share in cash, nearly 30 percent higher than Sourcefire's closing price on Monday. The offer includes retention-based incentives for Sourcefire's executives. The deal is Cisco's biggest since its $5 billion acquisition of NDS Group Ltd. last year. Sourcefire, founded in 2001, has grown into a major cybersecurity provider -- one that has rejected numerous takeover bids through the years. Last year, the company reported $5 million in profit on revenue $223.1 million. In a statement, Cisco said that adding Sourcefire would give it a portfolio of next-generation security offerings. ''Buy has always been a key part of our build-buy-partner innovation strategy,'' said Hilton Romanski, a Cisco vice president for corporate development. ''Sourcefire aligns well with Cisco's future vision for security and supports the key pillars of our security strategy.'' The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year, pending approval by regulators and other closing conditions. It is expected to slightly dilute Cisco's earnings for its 2014 fiscal year. Shares in Sourcefire climbed about 29 percent in premarket trading, to $76.40, over the deal price, in a potential sign that investors might be expecting a bidding war. Shares in Cisco dipped slightly, to $25.66. Cisco was advised by JPMorgan Chase and Centerview Partners, while Sourcefire was advised by Qatalyst Partners, the boutique investment bank founded by Frank Quattrone. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Homeland Confusion,"Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, members of a task force on oversight of the Department of Homeland Security, were co-chairmen of the 9/11 Commission. NO single event in the last half-century has had a greater effect on American national security policy than the terrorist attacks that occurred 12 years ago today. When we co-chaired the 9/11 Commission, which was set up in 2002 and issued its report on the attacks in 2004, we investigated the failures that left our country vulnerable and recommended 41 actions to correct them and strengthen our national security. Nine years after the 9/11 Commission made its case, our country is still not as safe as it could and should be. Though the vast majority of our recommendations have been followed, at least in part, Congress has not acted on one of our major proposals: to streamline the way it oversees homeland security.  In a cumbersome legacy of the pre-9/11 era, Congress oversees the Department of Homeland Security with a welter of overlapping committees and competing legislative proposals. The department was created in 2002 out of 22 agencies and departments. More than 100 congressional committees and subcommittees currently claim jurisdiction over it. This patchwork system of supervision results in near-paralysis and a lack of real accountability. This needs to change. In a bipartisan report that we are releasing today, as members of a task force of national security experts, former Homeland Security officials and former and current members of Congress (convened by the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands and a program of the Aspen Institute), we argue that the American people will be safer if Congress takes a clearer, less complicated approach to its supervision of national security. Congress needs to treat the Department of Homeland Security as it does the Departments of Justice and Defense and give primary oversight responsibility to fewer committees. The complexity of the current system leads to gridlock. In August, Robert S. Mueller III, then the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, warned that a cyberthreat will ''equal or even eclipse the terrorist threat'' -- yet the seven congressional committees that claim jurisdiction over the issue haven't been able to agree on whether the Department of Homeland Security or another agency should take primary responsibility for addressing the threat. Last year, when a bill on cybersecurity from the House Homeland Security Committee competed with proposals from three other House committees, none gained enough traction to pass both the House and the Senate. In April, a bill on cybersecurity intelligence sharing was passed by the House, but it has not been brought to a vote in the Senate, which is reportedly drafting its own bills on the issue in at least three different committees. The system also results in gaps in oversight. When you fly on a major airline from a major airport, you are screened by the Transportation Security Administration, a part of the Department of Homeland Security -- but because of insufficient federal supervision, that's not necessarily so when you board a private jet at any number of small airports across the United States. Likewise, a federal list of 75 biological threats hasn't been properly prioritized, preventing us from focusing on the deadliest ones, in part because Congress oversees the Department of Homeland Security in one committee and Health and Human Services in another. Finally, the system is wasteful. In the 112th Congress, which ended in January, Homeland Security personnel took part in 289 formal House and Senate hearings, involving 28 committees, caucuses and commissions. In 2009 alone, Homeland Security personnel spent the equivalent of 66 work-years responding to questions from Congress, at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $10 million. This isn't a partisan issue. The first homeland security secretary, Tom Ridge, a Republican appointee, raised concerns during his tenure about the fragmented system of oversight, and the former homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano, a Democratic appointee, complained that members of her staff were often ''spending more time responding to Congressional requests and requirements than executing their mandated homeland security responsibilities.'' Congress, typically reluctant to give up its powers midterm, is unlikely to enact serious reform until the 114th Congress in 2015. In the meantime, though, members should take steps to accelerate homeland security legislation by placing time limits on committees' consideration of Homeland Security bills. They also should set clear priorities for the department by passing an authorization bill, which Congress has never done. Congress needs to reform the way it oversees homeland security and examine the department with tough and direct scrutiny. As we said in the 9/11 Commission report, unless Congress does its job, ''the American people will not get the security they want and need.'' "
"Hacking U.S. Secrets, China Pushes for Drones","BEIJING -- For almost two years, hackers based in Shanghai went after one foreign defense contractor after another, at least 20 in all. Their target, according to an American cybersecurity company that monitored the attacks, was the technology behind the United States' clear lead in military drones. ''I believe this is the largest campaign we've seen that has been focused on drone technology,'' said Darien Kindlund, manager of threat intelligence at the company, FireEye, based in California. ''It seems to align pretty well with the focus of the Chinese government to build up their own drone technology capabilities.'' The hacking operation, conducted by a group called ''Comment Crew,'' was one of the most recent signs of the ambitions of China's drone development program. The government and military are striving to put China at the forefront of drone manufacturing, for their own use and for export, and have made an all-out push to gather domestic and international technology to support the program. Foreign Ministry officials have said China does not sanction hacking, and is itself a victim, but another American cybersecurity company has tracked members of Comment Crew to a building of the People's Liberation Army outside Shanghai.  China is now dispatching its own drones into potential combat arenas. Every major arms manufacturer in China has a research center devoted to drones, according to Chinese and foreign military analysts. Those companies have shown off dozens of models to potential foreign buyers at international air shows. Chinese officials this month sent a drone near disputed islands administered by Japan; debated using a weaponized drone last year to kill a criminal suspect in Myanmar; and sold homemade drones resembling the Predator, an American model, to other countries for less than a million dollars each. Meanwhile, online photographs reveal a stealth combat drone, the Lijian, or Stealth Sword, in a runway test in May. Military analysts say China has long tried to replicate foreign drone designs. Some Chinese drones appearing at recent air shows have closely resembled foreign ones. Ian M. Easton, a military analyst at the Project 2049 Institute in Virginia, said cyberespionage was one tool in an extensive effort over years to purchase or develop drones domestically using all available technology, foreign and domestic. Chinese engineers and officials have done reverse engineering, studied open source material and debriefed American drone experts who attend conferences and other meetings in China. ''This can save them years of design work and mistakes,'' Mr. Easton said. The Chinese military has not released statistics on the size of its drone fleet, but a Taiwan Defense Ministry report said that as of mid-2011, the Chinese Air Force alone had more than 280 drone units, and analysts say the other branches have thousands, which means China's fleet count is second only to the 7,000 or so of the United States. ''The military significance of China's move into unmanned systems is alarming,'' said a 2012 report by the Defense Science Board, a Pentagon advisory committee. China's domestic security apparatus, whose $124 billion official budget this year is larger than that of the military, is also keenly interested in drones, which raises questions about the potential use of drones for surveillance and possibly even attacks inside China, including in restive areas of Xinjiang and Tibet. Drone technology conferences here are attended by both military and domestic security officials. An international conference on nonmilitary drones is scheduled to take place in Beijing from Sept. 25 to 28. A signal moment in China's drone use came on Sept. 9, when the navy sent a surveillance drone near the disputed Diaoyu Islands, which Japan administers and calls the Senkakus. Japanese interceptor jets scrambled to confront it. This was the first time China had ever deployed a drone over the East China Sea. The Chinese Defense Ministry said ''regular drills'' had taken place ''at relevant areas in the East China Sea, which conform to relevant international laws and practices.'' The drone appeared to be a BZK-005, a long-range aircraft used by the Chinese Navy that made its public debut in 2006 at China's air show in Zhuhai, said an American official. Mr. Easton said deploying the drone near disputed waters and islands ''was very much a first'' for China and had caught Japanese officials off guard. ''I think this is really just the beginning of a much broader trend we're going to see -- for China to increase its ability to monitor the East China Sea and the Western Pacific, beyond the Philippines, and to increase the operational envelope of their strike capabilities,'' he said. The Chinese military, with its constant focus on potential war over Taiwan and an eye on China's growing territorial disputes, is at the vanguard of preparing drones for use in maritime situations. That is unlike the United States, which has used drones to hunt and kill suspected terrorists and guerrilla fighters, mostly in Pakistan and Afghanistan. American drones ''are not designed to enter into contested or denied air space,'' Mr. Easton said. ''So they would be unable to fight in any conflict with China.'' China, on the other hand, is building drones, also called unmanned aerial vehicles, precisely to operate in contested spaces. ''It's a very useful instrument for safeguarding maritime sovereignty,'' said Xu Guangyu, a retired major general and director of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association. ''China will gradually step up its use of U.A.V.'s in this area.'' Chinese strategists have discussed using drones in attack situations if war with the United States were to break out in the Pacific, according to the Project 2049 report. Citing Chinese military technical material, the report said the People's Liberation Army's ''operational thinkers and scientists envision attacking U.S. aircraft-carrier battle groups with swarms of multimission U.A.V.'s in the event of conflict.'' University research centers are at the core of China's drone program. The oldest research and production center for drones is the Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi'an, where design work began in 1958. The ASN Technology Group, linked to the school, said on its Web site that it produces 90 percent of Chinese drones. At the program's start, China reverse-engineered drones it had acquired from the Soviet Union in the 1950s. It also got its hands on American drones that crashed in Vietnam in the 1960s and in China while monitoring China's nuclear weapons program. China bought 100 Harpy armed drones from Israel in the 1990s -- its only significant purchase of foreign-made drones -- and the Pentagon later pressured Israel not to upgrade those drones for China. In recent years, China has continued to acquire foreign drone technology and is especially focused on studying American models. ''American U.A.V. technology is very sophisticated,'' Mr. Xu said. ''We can only envy their technology. Right now, we're learning from them.'' For the Obama administration and American business executives, no method of Chinese technology acquisition is more worrisome than cyberespionage. An American official confirmed that drone technology had been stolen by hackers. FireEye, the cybersecurity company in California, called the drone theft campaign Operation Beebus, traced back to a command-and-control node at bee.businessconsults.net. Cybersecurity experts say that general address and tools linked to it are associated with the Comment Crew, the Chinese hacker unit that Mandiant, another cybersecurity company, discussed in a report in February. Mandiant said the group was part of Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army, based in Shanghai. Though the initial victims in Operation Beebus were large defense contractors, the hackers began to pick out companies that specialized in drone technology, said Mr. Kindlund, FireEye's threat intelligence manager. They then alternated between large companies that made a wide range of military technology and boutique firms that focused on drones. In China, it is not just the military that is looking at uses for drones. In February, Liu Yuejin, the director of the antidrugs bureau in the Ministry of Public Security, which is responsible for domestic security, told Global Times, a state-run newspaper, that the ministry had considered using a drone armed with 44 pounds of explosives to kill a Burmese man in northern Myanmar suspected of ordering the murders of 13 Chinese sailors on the Mekong River. In the end, the idea was shelved because senior Chinese officials wanted the suspect, Naw Kham, captured alive. Chinese drones are increasingly appearing in the arsenals of other nations. The Chinese version of the Predator, the Wing Loong, or Pterodactyl, was first exported in 2011, according to People's Daily. At the Paris Air Show in June, the president of a Chinese aeronautics company told Global Times that the drone could carry two laser-guided missiles and was the equal of the Predator in endurance and flight range, but was much cheaper.

Adobe Announces Security Breach,"Hackers infiltrated the computer system of the software company Adobe, gaining access to credit card information and other personal data from 2.9 million of its customers, the company acknowledged on Thursday.  The security breach, which Adobe called a part of a ''sophisticated attack,'' also allowed hackers to obtain encrypted passwords and other personal information from customers. Hackers also illegally took copies of the source code of some of the company's widely used products, which are run on personal computers and businesses servers around the world. There was no indication that the attackers obtained unencrypted credit card numbers, Adobe said in a statement. As a precaution, however, the company said it had notified customers and credit card companies about the breach and reset customer passwords to prevent further unauthorized access. ''Cyberattacks are one of the unfortunate realities of doing business today,'' Adobe's chief security officer, Brad Arkin, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. ''Given the profile and widespread use of many of our products, Adobe has attracted increasing attention from cyberattackers.'' The breach at Adobe is one of a recent spate of hacking episodes at prominent organizations. Already this year, hackers have infiltrated database aggregators like Lexis-Nexis and Dun & Bradstreet and the security firm Kroll Background America, as well as the National White Collar Crime Center, which helps businesses protect their computer systems. Concerns about the security of data at Adobe were first raised last week, when a technology researcher and an independent journalist investigating the hacking episodes discovered copies of Adobe source code on a server that was believed to have been used in the previous attacks. Brian Krebs, the journalist, informed Adobe about his findings, and on Thursday publicly reported the hacking on his site, krebsonsecurity.com. One of the products that had its source code stolen is ColdFusion, which, according to Adobe, is used by the United States Senate, 75 of the Fortune 100 companies and more than 10,000 other companies worldwide. Adobe security officials said they were not aware of any specific risks to customers. But because the source code contains the DNA of the software program, computer experts said it could allow hackers to find and exploit any other potential weaknesses in its security. "
Attack Ravages Power Grid. (Just a Test.),"WASHINGTON -- In windowless rooms from here to California, nearly 10,000 electrical engineers, cybersecurity specialists, utility executives and F.B.I. agents furiously grappled over 48 hours with an unseen ''enemy'' who tried to turn out the lights across America. The enemy injected computer viruses into grid control systems, bombed transformers and substations and knocked out power lines by the dozen. By late Thursday morning, in this unprecedented continental-scale war game to determine how prepared the nation is for a cyberattack, tens of millions of Americans were in simulated darkness. Hundreds of transmission lines and transformers were declared damaged or destroyed, and the engineers were rushing to assess computers that were, for the purposes of the drill, tearing their system apart.  ''It's going really well,'' said Gerry W. Cauley, the president and chief executive of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which ran the drill. ''A bit scary, but really well.'' There were seven ''deaths'' of police officers, firefighters and utility workers who showed up to investigate reports of problems at substations or power lines and were shot by attackers still on the scene. In all, there were 150 ''casualties,'' Mr. Cauley said. Attempts to restore equipment and get the lights back on were stymied by police officers who locked down the locations because of ''active shooters.'' The degree of simulation varied, organizers said. Nobody touched actual operating equipment, but some companies sent trucks with linemen aboard to investigate the status of key transformers because the ''scenarios'' written by Mr. Cauley's group included computer viruses that kept technicians at the control centers from knowing the condition of crucial equipment. The drill also involved ''denial of service'' attacks, in which hackers flooded a computer connected to the Internet with so many messages that it could not handle the load. In real life, banks and other companies have been hit with such attacks. Drill participants said they would not talk about the specific locations of the simulated attacks, for two reasons: The locations were chosen at points that the insiders knew were vulnerable, and the companies involved were promised that if they participated, their performance would not be held up to public criticism. The purpose, organizers said, was to pose problems that were hard to solve, to expose areas that needed improvement. In a much smaller drill two years ago, known as GridEx, for Grid Exercise, analysis afterward found that participants were good at communicating with their neighbors, electrically speaking, but not with national organizations like the electric reliability corporation, making it hard for anyone to get an overview of what was happening. How well they did this time in what the national group called GridEx II will not be clear for weeks. One main component of the drill was a log of all communications to record who said what to whom, by email or phone, to determine whether the participants could promptly reach the appropriate people at power companies, police stations or distant cybersecurity centers, and whether they could convey the appropriate information. The information supplied by the game controllers included some ''fog of war'' confusion, Mr. Cauley said. From one undisclosed location in suburban Washington, the electric reliability corporation used a crew of about 40 people to lead the exercise, announcing new attacks and other developments. At a second undisclosed spot, but also in suburban Washington at the Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, specialists took calls from electric industry technicians and operators to assist in responding to about 40 cyberattacks. At 210 utility companies, participants responded to developments served up by drill managers. Most of the companies are in the United States, but some are Canadian and Mexican utilities integrated into the American grid. Royal Canadian Mounted Police officials also participated. The script for some of the attacks, physical and cyber, resembled actual attacks in this country and around the world, said one participant. And they came thick and fast. ''They were trying to drive their people to saturation,'' the participant said. At the Southwestern Electric Power Company, a subsidiary of American Electric Power that serves parts of Louisiana, Arkansas and eastern Texas, attackers used guns and bombs against a power plant and a transformer, and 108,000 of the company's 520,000 customers lost power. ''There were certainly surprises for us,'' said Venita McCellon-Allen, the president and chief operating officer. ''I sat up straight in my chair.'' Most of the company's participants in the drill were in a conference room at a control center in Shreveport, La., she said, but the activity included contacts with the corporate parent, in Columbus, Ohio. ''It was more severe than anything we've drilled,'' she said. By the end of the exercise, 20,000 customers were still in the dark. The parent company got hit harder: Power was knocked out for an additional 162,000 customers, and one employee was killed. The drill ran through business hours on Wednesday and half of the day on Thursday, but each hour of drill time was meant to simulate about four hours of activity. After the drill ended, top utility executives and federal officials were to meet to discuss how they would react in the days, weeks and perhaps months of recovery that would follow. In a period of anxiety about cyberattacks and the vulnerability of the nation's infrastructure, news that GridEx II would be held engendered yet more nervousness, some of it bizarre. One website tried to connect a joint training exercise in Hawaii between American and Chinese military personnel with the electricity drill . Another described it as a prelude to the government's declaring martial law. Nadya Bartol, the senior cybersecurity strategist at the Utilities Telecom Council, a trade group in Washington with hundreds of electric, water and gas utility members, said it was important to remember that the drill did not involve actual electric service. ''It's a fire drill, not a fire,'' she said. Ms. Bartol, who was not involved in the drill, said her group's members found exercises like this very useful. ''It's a good idea, just like it's a good idea for a student to take a training test for the SAT,'' she said. "
"Bubble or No, This Virtual Currency Is a Lot of Coin in Any Realm","WHEN he was a Yale Law School student, Reuben Grinberg wrote one of the first academic papers about Bitcoin, a novel virtual currency that uses sophisticated cryptography to validate and secure transactions that exist only online. When Mr. Grinberg, now a lawyer in the financial institutions group of the Manhattan law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, first learned about bitcoins, they were selling for 10 cents. Now, after the latest price surge that began in January, the cost of a bitcoin on an exchange that converts them to dollars is something like $140, and the collective value of all bitcoins has passed a billion dollars. That is a lot of coin in any form, and the billion-dollar milestone has turned the once-obscure online currency into a media sensation. Had Mr. Grinberg invested just $100 back then, today his investment would be worth ... Ah, but that way madness lies. ''People are buying bitcoins because the price is going up,'' he said in an interview. ''That is the classic indicator of a bubble.''  The question of whether the increase represents real value or is simply evidence of a bubble is at the heart of the current media frenzy. Bitcoin began in January 2009, a project introduced by a programmer or group of programmers who worked under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The project represented a breakthrough in using software code to authenticate and protect transactions without resorting to a centralized bank or government treasury. In that way, Bitcoin became a peer-to-peer system. That comes in pretty handy for people who do not want their transactions monitored. In conversations about the project with scholars who study it, the word that comes up as often as ''bubble'' is ''genius.'' For one thing, though bitcoins are software code, you can't simply copy them like a music file. The process of creating the coins -- ''mining'' them in the project's allusion to something tangible like gold or silver -- involves computer work that, crucially, verifies Bitcoin transactions. ''It is the most successful digital currency already right now,'' said Nicolas Christin, the associate director of the Information Networking Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. ''Even if bitcoins become worth nothing, it has succeeded more than any academic proposals for a digital currency,'' he said in an interview from Okinawa, Japan, where he was attending a conference on financial cryptography that included a number of papers on bitcoins. People buy the coins for cold hard cash on exchanges. Completing those purchases, as well as cashing out, typically involves re-entering the world of traditional financial transactions, with fees and loss of anonymity. But Bitcoin's managers say the currency has proved so secure that despite the fact that exchanges and virtual wallets, where people keep their bitcoins, have been hacked, the coins themselves have not been forged. So why the sudden run-up in value? Some point to the recent crisis over Cypriot banks, which made a currency beyond the control of governments more tempting. And as with a run-up in anything tradable -- tulip bulbs, dot-com shares -- there is also the hypnotic logic that says the price went up today, so that means it will go up tomorrow. Some observers and investors also make the case that bitcoins are in fact undervalued. Their argument goes like this. The total value of the world's economic activity is enormous. There are certain transactions that are ideal for bitcoins because the currency is relatively anonymous and does not need to be processed by a financial organization or a government. If bitcoins become the dominant currency in some small niche of the world economy -- that is, those people who do not want their transactions easily tracked or who want to send money back home from abroad -- then they will become quite valuable indeed. This outcome has been neatly summarized by the financial blogger Felix Salmon as making bitcoins an ''uncomfortable combination of commodity and currency.'' The price increase becomes a question of supply and demand. Unlike other currencies that can adjust the money supply depending on economic conditions, bitcoins have a supply that is fixed. The amount of new coins that can be minted was plotted at the outset with a finite number of coins at the end, roughly 21 million in the next century. Today, the rate is 25 new coins every 10 minutes; for the first four years, it was twice as many, 50 every 10 minutes. The slowdown in the rate new coins are added, which was programmed into bitcoins, may also help account for the spike in prices. So far, excluding investors and day traders, the main use of the currency appears to be illicit activity. There are the online gambling sites that use bitcoins. And the anonymous online marketplace Silk Road, which accepts only bitcoins, is ''overwhelmingly used as a market for controlled substances and narcotics,'' according to a paper on Silk Road written by Mr. Christin of Carnegie Mellon. He used clues on the site, including buyer feedback reports, to calculate how much and what kind of business was being transacted. His conclusion, as of July 2012, was that $1.2 million in business was carried out each month, much of it for buying small amounts of narcotics that were delivered by mail. ''We did see it was growing,'' he said of the total value of the trades. ''It pretty much doubled in the six months I followed it.'' Excluding the traders, he said, ''Silk Road probably represents a sizable amount of bitcoin exchanges, but not more than half.'' Supporters of the Bitcoin project acknowledge these statistics but argue that it can still thrive as a mainstream currency. ''I think when you talk about Silk Road, you are talking about the first early adopter market -- there is no other solution that works,'' said Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that manages the project. When the currency evolves to be more useful and better known, he said, it will be used for more mundane transactions. Even the idea that it is experiencing a bubble -- and Mr. Andresen said in an interview by phone from Amherst, Mass., ''I think it definitely is a frenzy'' -- is for the best. ''Eventually the media gets bored and moves on to the next thing,'' he said, ''and what is left behind is a whole new wave of people interested.'' And, he says, a much lower price for bitcoins. As evidence of mainstream interest, Mr. Andresen pointed to the Bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose, Calif., next month, which is attracting entrepreneurs with Silicon Valley venture capital backing. The list of panelists is heavy with start-up executives, but includes some activists -- including representatives from the Web site Antiwar.com and the Electronic Frontier Foundation -- who see a currency outside of government regulation as crucial to financing projects that criticize the authorities. Mr. Andresen is not a mere bystander to the fluctuations in bitcoin prices. As an employee of the Bitcoin Foundation, after working as volunteer on the software, he is paid in bitcoins, with the rate set every three months. In 2013, his salary in terms of dollars has increased more than tenfold. Starting in April, however, the foundation has decided that, because of those fluctuations, his bitcoin salary would be adjusted each month, he said. Still, that alone makes this bubble different than many in the past: the creators are not looking to get their money and make a quick exit. "
"For Starters, It's Not a Coin","What is a bitcoin? As a virtual currency, it is hardly an easy or intuitive concept. The securities filing for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust defines a bitcoin as ''one type of a digital math-based asset that is issued by, and transmitted through, an open source, cryptographic protocol platform known as the bitcoin network.''  In plainer terms, a bitcoin is digital money that you cannot hold, but can be bought and sold online in exchange for traditional currencies like dollars and yen. The value of a bitcoin is set by transactions on online exchanges. (On Monday, one exchange gave a value of $86.30 for one bitcoin.) A limited number of stores and Web sites also accept bitcoins as payment. The currency was invented in 2009 by a programmer or, possibly, a group of programmers known only as Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike national currencies backed by central banks, bitcoins are created by a decentralized network of users who solve complex mathematical problems -- a method known as ''mining'' -- to generate bitcoins. Only a finite number of bitcoins can be created, with the current count at about 11 million. They are stored in ''digital wallets'' as strings of letters and numbers. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
All That Glitters Online,"Proponents of digital currencies like bitcoins say these currencies provide greater security, lower costs and more stability than traditional forms of money like dollars and euros. But in the real world, bitcoins seem mostly to serve people engaged in illegal activities or speculation.  At a congressional hearing earlier this week, federal officials responsible for policing financial crimes said that bitcoins and other virtual currencies used in transactions primarily online could be subject to government regulation, an idea that might bring these units into the financial mainstream. After the hearing, the price of bitcoins shot up roughly 50 percent, to $900. But less than 24 hours later, it had tumbled to less than $700. Bitcoins -- software code generated by computers solving mathematical problems -- are not tied to any national currency and are not backed by any government. But they have attracted a following among investors, technologists and criminals, who find them appealing because no centralized authority regulates them. There are about 12 million bitcoins in existence now, and only 21 million units can ever be created. The limit is designed by the bitcoin creator or creators (known only by the name Satoshi Nakamoto) to ensure that there would never be a glut of coins that would depress their value. People can trade dollars and other real currencies for bitcoins on Internet exchanges. Users can transfer the digital coins without using banks and can use the bitcoins to pay for goods and services from merchants who take this currency; so far, that includes the dating site OkCupid and murky websites that sell illegal drugs and firearms. Bitcoin supporters assert that the virtual currency uses cryptography in ways that make it more secure than credit cards or payment services like PayPal. They also argue that bitcoin transactions are cheaper to conduct because the transfers do not have to go through banks and other financial middlemen. Officials from the Treasury Department, the Secret Service and the Department of Justice acknowledge that virtual currencies are not illegal. But ensuring that businesses that use them comply with financial laws will remain a big challenge. Law enforcement agencies have shut down some illicit operations, but new ones seem to appear daily. "
"Unlike Liberty Reserve, Bitcoin Is Not Anonymous - Yet","After Liberty Reserve, an online payment system, was shut down by law enforcement authorities Tuesday, many wondered whether Bitcoin, the digital currency, would be next. Just a couple of years ago, a large pepperoni pizza would have cost you 10,000 Bitcoins. Now, a single Bitcoin is worth roughly $129. Bitcoin's meteoric rise has been driven up largely by speculators who believe, like gold, it could be a haven from the fluctuations of other currencies. But in small part, that hyper-inflation also has been driven by those who believe the digital currency provides anonymous cover for illicit transactions. Silk Road, a black market for illegal drugs, relies on Bitcoin. Assassins are also apparently big fans.  (On the far, other end of the spectrum, it turns out the Winklevoss twins are also believers).  But contrary to conventional wisdom, Bitcoin is not anonymous. In fact, security experts say that if prosecutions like Liberty Reserve continue, the most likely targets are major payment systems like WebMoney and eForexGold, payment systems that security experts contend allow their users to move capital anywhere in the world without verifying their identities. ""There are a multitude of anonymous payments systems out there, similar to Liberty Reserve, of which there are over 100,"" said Tom Kellermann, a vice president of the security company Trend Micro. ""Many pretend to 'know thy customer' but do not actually do due diligence."" Bitcoin operates with greater transparency than those systems. It may be fully decentralized and requires no central bank or government authority, but Bitcoin transactions are as public - if not more so - than any other payment network. Each transaction is recorded in a public ledger, called a ""block chain,"" to keep people from writing the digital equivalent of a bad check. That public block chain makes it possible to trace transactions, even years after they have transpired. In one case, researchers were able to trace the spending of 25,000 stolen Bitcoins in 2011. Laundry services like Bitlaundry and Bitcoinlaundry make transactions harder to trace. But it's unclear how long those services can operate with impunity after the Liberty Reserve shutdown. It also requires a fair amount of blind trust to assume that such services won't themselves track - or steal - a users' Bitcoins. With some additional code, however, cryptographers believe Bitcoin could finally live up to its covert reputation. At an annual security and privacy symposium in San Francisco last week, a group of cryptographers from Johns Hopkins University debuted Zerocoin, a Bitcoin add-on that if widely adopted could make Bitcoin transactions impossible to trace. The cryptographers, Ian Miers, Christina Garman, Matthew Green and Aviel D. Rubin, believe Zerocoin could eventually ""break the link between individual Bitcoin transactions without adding trusted parties."" The cryptography will make your head spin - a full technical explanation is available here - but Mr. Miers likened Zerocoin to an in-house laundry service. Essentially, the Zerocoin add-on allows users to leave their Bitcoins floating in a wash, for someone else to grab, so long as they can redeem the same amount of Bitcoin in the future. There are some significant caveats. For Zerocoin to work, it will eventually require full-scale adoption. ""People have to have faith in the currency system to actually use it,"" Mr. Miers said. Zerocoins also require more computing power, which can lead to glitches and lag times. A complete transaction takes about two seconds to verify, which can be unpalatable to impatient users. Another challenge, Mr. Miers said, is explaining the ""heavyweight crypto"" to users. ""As complicated as Bitcoin is, you can explain the crypto even to nonexperts,"" Mr. Green wrote in a blog post last month. ""Unfortunately Zerocoin is a different animal. It will take time to convince people that these new techniques are safe."" But the biggest challenge, in light of Tuesday's indictment of Liberty Reserve, could be government interference. Law enforcement officials have largely left Bitcoin alone. One exception was earlier this month when the federal authorities seized accounts associated with Mutum Sigillum, an intermediary of Mt. Gox, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange. But according to the warrant, the accounts were seized because Mutum Sigillum had not properly registered as a money transmitter with the Treasury Department. If Bitcoin became a truly anonymous payment system, security experts say it would spur far greater scrutiny if it hasn't already.  "
Study Suggests Link Between Dread Pirate Roberts and Satoshi Nakamoto,"Two Israeli computer scientists say they may have uncovered a puzzling financial link between Ross William Ulbricht, the recently arrested operator of the Internet black market known as the Silk Road, and the secretive inventor of bitcoin, the anonymous online currency, used to make Silk Road purchases. Dorit Ron, a computer scientist at the Weizmann Institute, and Adi Shamir, a pioneering cryptographer who is a member of the  applied mathematics faculty at the Institute, will publish a paper Sunday exploring how the 29-year-old Mr. Ulbricht, who was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in October and has been charged with a murder-for-hire scheme and  narcotics-trafficking, acquired and protected the estimated millions he made in commissions operating Silk Road. The researchers say Silk Road, at the time of Mr. Ulbricht's arrest, had sales of $1.2 billion, generating $80 million in commissions. A huge run-up in the value of bitcoin in the last month has exponentially increased those amounts.   However, the researchers added, they believe the F.B.I. has seized only about 22 percent of the commissions they have identified, and that they  themselves have only been able to trace about a third of the total. The Silk Road site, which has been called an ""eBay for drugs"" was intended to permit any kind of anonymous transaction between buyers and sellers of illegal goods or activities. It was shut down  when the F.B.I. arrested Mr. Ulbricht, who used the Internet identity ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" while he was sitting in a public library in San Francisco near his home. The two scientists have been exploring the web of financial transactions produced by bitcoin, the anonymous currency that  has drawn the attention of both law enforcement and federal regulators in recent months. Their research is made possible by the fact that while bitcoin is designed to protect the anonymity of buyers and sellers, the actual transactions are public. Earlier this year, the researchers obtained a complete listing of all bitcoin transactions and have since been exploring the ""graph"" of those interactions in an attempt to gain statistical insights into user behavior in the anonymous financial market. After Mr. Ulbricht was arrested last month, the scientists used public information to begin tracing Silk Road-related transactions. Among their discoveries was a particular transfer to an account controlled by Mr. Ulbricht from another that had been created in January 2009, during the very earliest days of the bitcoin network, which was set up the previous year. Although the authors state that they cannot prove that that account belongs to the person who created the bitcoin currency, it is widely believed that the first accounts belong to a person who identifies himself as ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" but who has remained anonymous and has not been publicly heard from since 2010. Individual bitcoin is generated using a cryptographic algorithm that requires computer-processing power and that insures that each coin remains unique and cannot be copied. After seizing Mr. Ulbricht's computer, the F.B.I. spent several weeks analyzing data, determining that the laptop contained a digital wallet with 144,336 bitcoin, currently valued at more than $122 million, which the agency has attempted to freeze. In tracing various transactions made to and from Mr. Ulbricht's account, the authors found an intriguing one involving the transfer of 1,000 bitcoin, which would have been worth $60,000 when it was made on March 20 of this year, but is now worth roughly $847,000. They write: ""Such a single large transfer does not represent the typical behavior of a buyer who opens an account on Silk Road in order to purchase some narcotics (such buyers are expected to make an initial deposit of tens or hundreds of dollars, and to top the account off whenever they buy additional merchandise). It could represent either large-scale activity on Silk Road, or some form of investment or partnership, but this is pure speculation."" The mysterious account that made the investment had at one point accumulated 77,600 bitcoin, mostly through ""mining"" operations, an amount which would now be worth approximately $64 million. ""The short path we found suggests (but does not prove) the existence of a surprising link between the two mysterious figures of the bitcoin community, Satoshi Nakamoto and DPR,"" the authors write, referring to Mr. Ulbricht as the Dread Pirate Roberts. In addition to the curious transaction, which they say they cannot explain, the authors said they discovered that much of the bitcoin accumulated by Mr. Ulbricht has remained beyond the F.B.I.'s grasp. The scientists note that, for technical reasons, seizing and controlling bitcoin from a computer is a much greater challenge for law enforcement than illicitly obtained cash stored in a safe. With bitcoin, its very design may  make it possible for its support community to move to thwart law enforcement or any resale of  the digital tokens. In addition, the scientists speculated that the reason the F.B.I. had not recovered all Mr. Ulbricht's bitcoin might be that he was using a second computer that has not been located. Dr. Ron and Dr. Shamir noted that despite the fact that the F.B.I. closed the original Silk Road black market, a second ""Silk Road anonymous market"" has been created since. Satoshi Nakamoto's actual identity remains a hotly debated topic among Internet researchers. A number of individuals claim to have discovered his true identity, but those assertions have either been denied or ignored by those named. The F.B.I. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  "

Hacking Victims Edge Into Light,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Hackers have hit thousands of American corporations in the last few years, but few companies ever publicly admit it. Most treat online attacks as a dirty secret best kept from customers, shareholders and competitors, lest the disclosure sink their stock price and tarnish them as hapless. Rarely have companies broken that silence, usually when the attack is reported by someone else. But in the last few weeks more companies have stepped forward. Twitter, Facebook and Apple have all announced that they were attacked by sophisticated cybercriminals. The New York Times revealed its experience with hackers in a front-page article last month. The admissions reflect the new way some companies are calculating the risks and benefits of going public. While companies once feared shareholder lawsuits and the ire of the Chinese government, some can't help noticing that those that make the disclosures are lauded, as Google was, for their bravery. Some fear the embarrassment of being unable to fend off hackers who may still be in high school.  But as hacking revelations become more common, the threat of looking foolish fades and more companies are seizing the opportunity to take the leap in a crowd. ''There is a 'hide in the noise' effect right now,'' said Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a nonprofit security research and education organization. ''This is a particularly good time to get out the fact that you got hacked, because if you are one of many, it discounts the starkness of the announcement.'' In 2010, when Google alerted some users of Gmail -- political activists, mostly -- that it appeared Chinese hackers were trying to read their mail, such disclosures were a rarity. In its announcement, Google said that it was one of many -- two dozen -- companies that had been targeted by the same group. Google said it was making the announcement, in part, to encourage other companies to open up about the problem. But of that group, only Intel and Adobe Systems reluctantly stepped forward, and neither provided much detail. Twitter admitted that it had been hacked this month. Facebook and Apple followed suit two weeks later. Within hours after The Times published its account, The Wall Street Journal chimed in with a report that it, too, had been attacked by what it believed to be Chinese hackers. The Washington Post followed. Not everyone took advantage of the cover. Bloomberg, for example, has repeatedly denied that its systems were also breached by Chinese hackers, despite several sources that confirmed that its computers were infected with malware. Computer security experts estimate that more than a thousand companies have been attacked recently. In 2011, security researchers at McAfee unearthed a vast online espionage campaign, called Operation Shady Rat, that found more than 70 organizations had been hit over a five-year period, many in the United States. ''I am convinced that every company in every conceivable industry with significant size and valuable intellectual property and trade secrets has been compromised (or will be shortly) with the great majority of the victims rarely discovering the intrusion or its impact,'' Dmitri Alperovitch, then McAfee's vice president for threat research, wrote in his findings. ''In fact,'' said Mr. Alperovitch, now the chief technology officer at Crowdstrike, a security start-up, ''I divide the entire set of Fortune Global 2000 firms into two categories: those that know they've been compromised and those that don't yet know.'' Of that group, there are still few admissions. A majority of companies that have at one time or another been the subject of news reports of online attacks refuse to confirm them. The list includes the International Olympic Committee, Exxon Mobil, Baker Hughes, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Chesapeake Energy, the British energy giant BG Group, the steel maker ArcelorMittal and Coca-Cola. Like Google, some companies have stepped forward in the interest of increasing awareness and improving security within their respective industries, often to little avail. In 2009, Heartland Payment Systems, a major payment processing company, took the unusual step of disclosing a major data breach on its systems that potentially exposed millions of credit and debit card customers to fraud. It did so against the advice of its lawyers. ''Until then, most people tried to sweep breaches under the rug,'' said Steve Elefant, then Heartland's chief information officer. ''We wanted to make sure that it didn't happen to us again and didn't want to sit back while the bad guys tried to pick us off one by one.'' Heartland helped set up the Payments Processors Information Sharing Council to share information about security threats and breaches within the industry. Again, the company's lawyers thought it was a bad idea. ''But we felt it was important.'' The effort did not stop its other members from sweeping their own breaches under the rug. Last year, Global Payments, a major payment processor, did not disclose that it had been the victim of two major breaches that potentially affected millions of accounts, until the attacks were reported by a well-known security blogger. Even then, it did not offer details that other companies could use to fortify their systems. Last week, President Obama signed an executive order that encouraged increased information-sharing about online threats between the government and private companies. But compliance with the order is voluntary, a weakened alternative to an online security bill that stalled in Congress last year after the Chamber of Commerce, a lobbying group that itself was hacked, led an effort to block it, saying that the regulations would be too burdensome. In Washington on Wednesday, several senior administration officials presented a new strategy for protecting American intellectual property by urging firms to step forward when attacked. ''There has been a reluctance by companies to come forward because of the concern about the impact on their shareholders or others,'' said Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division of the Justice Department. In October 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a new guidance that specifically outlined how publicly traded companies should disclose online attacks, but few disclosures have come because of it. ''Quite frankly, since then, there hasn't been an abundance of reporting on cyberevents despite the fact that they are clearly happening,'' said Jacob Olcott, a specialist in online risks who managed a Senate investigation into the disclosure practices. The best hope, Mr. Olcott said, is that as investors start paying more attention to the threats, they will demand that companies disclose them. ''I wouldn't hold my breath,'' Mr. Elefant said. ''There are an awful lot of lawyers out there trying to keep companies from exposing that these breaches are happening. And they are happening.'' "
"After an Online Attack, A Peek Into a Spam Den","MOSCOW -- For years, Igor A. Artimovich had been living in a three-room apartment he shared with his wife in St. Petersburg, sitting for long hours in front of his Lenovo laptop in his pajamas, drinking sugary coffee. If he were known at all to Western security analysts who track the origins of spam, and in particular the ubiquitous subset of spam e-mails that promote male sexual enhancement products, it was only by the handle he used in Russian chat rooms, Engel. His pleasant existence, living in obscurity, changed this summer when a court in Moscow linked Mr. Artimovich and three others with one of the world's most prolific spambots, or illegal networks of virus-infected computers that send spam. The ruling provided a peek into the shrouded world of the Viagra-spam industry, a multimillion-dollar illegal enterprise with tentacles stretching from Russia to India. Around the world every day, millions of people open their e-mail in-boxes to find invitations to buy Viagra or some other drug, potion or device to enhance sexual performance.  Who sends these notes and how they make money had remained a mystery to most recipients. The court put names and faces to a shadowy global network of infected computers known outside Russia as Festi and inside the country as Topol-Mailer, named after an intercontinental ballistic missile, the Topol-M. It was powerful enough to generate, at times, up to a third of all spam e-mail messages circulating globally. Prosecutors say Mr. Artimovich was one of two principal programmers who controlled the network of infected computers in a group that included a former signals intelligence officer in the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the successor agency to the K.G.B. Once they control the virus-infected computers, they are able to use software embedded on home and business computers to send persistent e-mails. The owner of an infected computer usually never knows the PC has been compromised. More often than not these days, those infected computers are in India, Brazil and other developing countries where users cannot afford virus protection. But the high-end programming of viruses often takes place in Russia. While the business model has been well understood -- it was the subject of an extensive study by the University of California, San Diego -- the individuals behind one of the largest spam gangs using it have largely avoided official scrutiny, until recently. The Tushino Court in Moscow convicted two people of designing and controlling the Festi botnet, and two others of paying for its services, but none of them specifically of distributing spam. Instead, the court convicted the group of using the Festi network in 2010 to turn thousands of browsers simultaneously to the Web page of the online payment system of Aeroflot, the Russian national airline, crashing it in what is known as a distributed denial of service attack. The spambot problem has vexed Western law enforcement officials, who complain the Russians ignore losses to global businesses that pay about $6 billion annually for spam filters, and to companies like Pfizer for sales lost to counterfeit pills. Computer security experts have long been intrigued by the possibility that the Russian government has turned to so-called black hat hackers for political tasks in exchange offering protection from prosecution. But any direct evidence has been lacking, though the Festi case adds to the circumstantial evidence. Russian authorities deny creating or turning a blind eye to botnets used to attack the Web sites of dissidents, or banks and government institutions in neighboring countries like Estonia or Georgia. Valery V. Yaschenko, a deputy director of the Kremlin-linked Institute for Problems of Information Security, said the Russian government ''condemns the practice of using strangers' computers for attacks, or for any reason.'' For years, spam has been a very good business for Russian criminal gangs. An estimated $60 million a year is pulled in through these networks. Despite the Russian prosecutors' victory this summer, similar networks remain active as tools for fraud and hacker attacks. Computer security experts say that suggests either the wrong men were convicted or the controlling codes were passed to somebody else. Stefan Savage, a professor in the systems and networking group at the University of California, San Diego, studied the Festi scheme, in part by making test purchases. The spam opened links to sites called ''Canada Pharmacy'' or ''Canadian Pharmacy,'' though they were in fact Russian-based companies that had privileges to process online payments from Visa through banks in Azerbaijan and Iceland. The sales were responsible for about a fifth of the $300 million global industry of selling fake drugs online, mostly to Americans, Mr. Savage said in an interview. What arrived in the mail was Viagra counterfeited in India, where intellectual property rights on pharmaceutical industry products are loosely enforced. Mr. Savage tested the pills through the process of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; they were close enough chemically to real Viagra that they most likely functioned safely, and as intended, for tens of thousands of American men. The Internet has experienced the ill effects. About 70 percent of all e-mail sent globally is still spam, according to Symantec, the antivirus company. Most of it violates a number of American laws, including the Can-Spam Act of 2003, which requires unsolicited e-mails to have a valid return address. The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, named for a teenager who died from an overdose of Vicodin bought on the Internet, outlaws online sales of drugs without a doctor's prescription. But there are still plenty of offers coming from abroad. For a three-month period last year, the Festi botnet was bursting with activity. It generated about a third of all global spam for those months, Paul Wood, the cybersecurity intelligence manager at Symantec, said in an interview. Why Russian authorities allowed Festi to function for years is unclear. Russians had little incentive to invest law enforcement resources in a crime that primarily affected Americans. But the illegal computer networks like Festi that are so useful for sending spam are also capable of crashing Web sites by flooding them with an overwhelming numbers of visits -- the distributed denial of service attacks. It was used last year inside Russia to crash opposition Web sites during the presidential election. The Festi network was the tool of choice in a prominent denial of service attack on LiveJournal, one of the blog-hosting services used by the Russian dissident and blogger Aleksei Navalny, according to Hacker, a Russian magazine focused on cybersecurity issues. In one of the few crackdowns, the Russian court case singled out four men: Pavel Vrublevsky, the owner of an online payment settlement business called ChronoPay, who for years has denied accusations of ties to Viagra spam schemes; Maksim Permakov, an employee of Mr. Vrublevsky and a former F.S.B. agent; Igor Artimovich, a former employee of Sun Microsystems in Russia; and his brother Dmitry Artimovich, a freelance programmer. All denied the charges and have said through their lawyers that they intend to appeal the sentences, which range from two to two and a half years in prison, except for Mr. Permakov, who conceded his role in using Festi and cooperated with investigators in exchange for a suspended sentence. Prosecutors argued that Igor Artimovich designed Festi. They say the executives at ChronoPay hired him to crash the Aeroflot site because they were angry at losing a tender for Aeroflot's business. The police say the executives asked Mr. Artimovich to settle the score. Analysts of Russian cybercrime say a line had been crossed by attacking a Russian site. In an interview before his sentencing, Mr. Artimovich said he was working on code under contract with ChronoPay, but for an antivirus program, not a virus. He said the police planted evidence on his laptop hard drive after his arrest. Mr. Vrublevsky, in an interview, denied any role in creating Festi and noted that in court a witness testified that the F.S.B., which investigated the case, had forged evidence. Festi was not the first Russian botnet to combine pharmaceutical spam with politics. In 2007, a large-scale cyberattack was begun on Estonia, taking aim at sites of government agencies, banks and anti-Russian groups, and a futuristic North Atlantic Treaty Organization center for cyberwarfare was built in Tallinn in response. But when the center's analysis of this attack and subsequent cyberstrikes on Georgia finally wrapped up, evidence pointed not to some similar, hushed bunker of military men somewhere in Russia, but to a server in St. Petersburg best known for its links to cybercrime, including penis-enlargement spam, and run by a hacker nicknamed Flyman. The 2009 NATO report on the attacks on Russia's neighbors noted pointedly of the St. Petersburg server's suspicious activity that ''the Russian authorities have remained remarkably passive in prosecuting the organization.'' "
European Union Warns on Bitcoin,"LONDON - The European Union on Friday added to a string of recent warnings about the safety of using and investing in Bitcoin, the virtual currency that is not issued by any government.  The union's banking authority said consumers needed to be aware that they were not protected through regulation when paying with Bitcoins. The digital currency is vulnerable to hackers, might lose its value and any misuse could prompt law enforcement agencies to close Bitcoin exchange platforms and keep consumers from accessing their investment, the European regulator said. ""Currently, no specific protection exists in the E.U. that would protect consumers from financial losses if a platform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or goes out of business,"" the European Banking Authority said, adding that it was looking into whether such currencies could and should be regulated. The warning comes after China last week restricted its banks from using Bitcoin as currency because of concerns about money laundering and a threat to financial stability. Germany said earlier this year that it would not recognize Bitcoin as a foreign currency and that gains from buying and selling Bitcoins would be taxable. Norway has been considering a similar stance. Since its creation in 2009 by anonymous programmers, Bitcoin has surged in popularity and consumers have been using the virtual currency to pay for goods and services. But some authorities and regulators decided only recently to treat the currency as something more serious than a temporary mania. New York state's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, said in November that he would consider issuing a so-called BitLicense for businesses that conduct transactions in virtual currencies like Bitcoin. At a Senate hearing last month, regulatory officials said virtual currencies could benefit the financial system but could also be abused for criminal activity. Britain's financial regulator has said it does not consider Bitcoin to be within its area of responsibility because the currency was not used widely enough to be considered money. The European Banking Authority said ""cases have been reported of consumers losing significant amounts of virtual currency with little prospect of having it returned.""  ""While virtual currencies continue to hit the headlines and are enjoying increasing popularity, consumers need to remain aware of the risks associated with them,"" the European authority said. Germany and China this month detained a group of people on suspicion of fraud linked to the virtual currency. The authority also warned that consumers should ""remain mindful that holding virtual currencies may have tax implications."" The value of Bitcoin rose beyond $1,100 in November, leaving its total worldwide value at more than $11 billion, but it has dropped below $1,000 since then.  "
Hackers Retrieve Personal Data in Washington State,"OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- The Washington State Administrative Office of the Courts was hacked sometime between last fall and February, and up to 160,000 Social Security numbers and a million driver's license numbers could have been obtained during the data breach of its public Web site, officials said Thursday.  Court officials said they have confirmed only that 94 Social Security numbers were obtained and they do not believe the larger number was compromised, but they wanted to alert the public to the possibility as a precaution. The 94 people affected are being contacted. The broader information ''just happened to be on a server in an area that was accessed,'' said Veronica Diseth, director of the courts' information services division. The breach happened because of a vulnerability in an Adobe Systems software program, ColdFusion, that has since been patched, court officials said. An Adobe spokeswoman, Heather Edell, confirmed that the problem had been resolved. Mike Keeling, the courts' information technology operations and maintenance manager, said officials were alerted to the breach by an East Coast business that had a similar intrusion. Court officials first believed all of the information obtained was public record, and did not think confidential information was taken, but after an inquiry by the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the broader breach was confirmed in April, a courts spokeswoman said.

A Guilty Plea In the Hacking Of Stratfor,"6:27 p.m. | Updated with additional comments from prosecutors and the defendant. Jeremy Hammond of Chicago, a member of the Lulzsec hacking collective, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to conspiring to attack a global intelligence firm. As a crowd of supporters watched, Mr. Hammond, 28, pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to engage in computer hacking. Mr. Hammond was arrested last year with the help of Hector Xavier Monsegur, the hacker better known by his hacking moniker Sabu. Mr. Monsegur was arrested and subsequently helped law-enforcement officials infiltrate Lulzsec, an offshoot of Anonymous, the loose hacking collective that has supported an ever-shifting variety of causes, ranging from democracy in the Middle East to justice for victims of sexual crimes.  Officials accused Lulzsec of defacing Web sites, stealing confidential information and putting victims temporarily out of business. Mr. Hammond was arrested in connection with a breach of the company Stratfor Global Intelligence Service and charged with stealing credit card information and using some of it to make more than $700,000 in fraudulent charges. The authorities had managed, with Mr. Monsegur's help, to persuade Mr. Hammond and Stratfor's other attackers to use one of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's own computers to store data stolen from Stratfor. The hackers complied and transferred ''multiple gigabytes of confidential data,'' including 60,000 credit card numbers, records for 860,000 Stratfor clients, employees' e-mails and financial data to the F.B.I.'s computers, according to the complaint against Mr. Hammond. Many of those e-mails later appeared on Wikileaks. Mr. Hammond told Judge Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court in Manhattan that in 2011 and 2012 he had gained unauthorized access to Stratfor's computer systems and several other groups, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Virtual Academy, the public safety department in Arizona, and Vanguard Defense Industries, which makes drones. ''As part of each of these hacks I took and disseminated confidential information,'' Mr. Hammond told the judge. ''I knew what I was doing was against the law.'' Later, Mr. Hammond issued a statement saying that he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to hack Stratfor, partly to avoid the possibility of being charged with hacking groups other than Stratfor. ''Now that I have pleaded guilty it is a relief to be able to say that I did work with Anonymous,'' Mr. Hammond wrote in a statement on a Web site run by his supporters. ''I did this because I believe people have a right to know what governments and corporations are doing behind closed doors.'' In a written statement, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said, ''While he billed himself as fighting for an anarchist cause, in reality, Jeremy Hammond caused personal and financial chaos for individuals whose identities and money he took and for companies whose businesses he decided he didn't like.'' Mr. Hammond faces up to 10 years in prison, prosecutors said, and has agreed to pay up to $2.5 million in restitution. Before his arrest last year, Mr. Hammond had already served 24 months in prison for hacking into a political group's computer server and stealing credit card numbers in 2006. Judge Preska said that Mr. Hammond will be sentenced in September. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Clues Emerge In A.T.M. Thefts,"When eight men from Queens were indicted last spring as part of a global network that looted $45 million from A.T.M.'s, an unanswered question was what happened to the money.  There was evidence that they splurged on fancy cars, Rolex watches and luxurious vacations. But they were accused of stealing $2.8 million, and the authorities believed that they must have set cash aside to pay the organizers of the operation. The stolen money might lead to the orchestrators of one of the largest thefts in New York history. On Monday, Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, announced the indictment of five more people in connection with the robbery and said the authorities had uncovered a clue as to what happened to at least some of the cash from the New York theft. ''Newly seized photographic evidence reveals that the defendants sent the lion's share of the proceeds to the organization's leaders, including $800,000 of criminal cash proceeds sent in luggage and transported to Florida by bus for delivery to a cyberheist organizer,'' Ms. Lynch's office said in a statement. The sophisticated robbery involved hacking into the computer systems of financial institutions, stealing prepaid debit card data and making fraudulent A.T.M. withdrawals. Groups known as ''cashing crews'' in more than 24 countries received the stolen banking data and proceeded to loot thousands of A.T.M.'s with surgical precision. The cashing crews first struck on Dec. 21, stealing $5 million from 4,500 A.T.M.'s. On Feb. 19, crews around the world struck again, stealing $40 million in more than 36,000 A.T.M. transactions, all coordinated and carried out in a matter of hours. The New York City crew took $400,000 in the first robbery and $2.4 million during the second strike, hitting 2,904 bank machines in a little over 10 hours. The six people indicted on Monday were part of the crew that looted machines around the city, according to court records. Law enforcement officials said one of the six, Saul Franjul, sent cash to those who orchestrated the robbery, and they released a photo, taken by one of the defendants, of a mountain of cash on a hotel bed and stuffed into a suitcase as evidence. The authorities said the cash was to be sent by bus to Alberto Yusi Lajud-Peña in Miami, and then on to the network's organizers overseas. Mr. Lajud-Peña was indicted in May and was believed to be the ringleader of the New York crew. The authorities declined to comment on the ultimate destination of the suitcase. Mr. Lajud-Peña fled to the Dominican Republic and was killed there during what the authorities believe was a botched robbery. A manila envelope with $100,000 was found by his body. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
What is a 'Hacktivist'?,"The untimely death of the young Internet activist Aaron Swartz, apparently by suicide, has prompted an outpouring of reaction in the digital world. Foremost among the debates being reheated - one which had already grown in the wake of larger and more daring data breaches in the past few years - is whether Swartz's activities as a ""hacktivist"" were being unfairly defined as malicious or criminal. In particular, critics (as well as Swartz's family in a formal statement) have focused on the federal government's indictment of Swartz for downloading millions of documents from the scholarly database JSTOR, an action which JSTOR itself had declined to prosecute.  I believe the debate itself is far broader than the specifics of this unhappy case, for if there was prosecutorial overreach it raises the question of whether we as a society created the enabling condition for this sort of overreach by letting the demonization of hacktivists go unanswered. Prosecutors do not work in a vacuum, after all; they are more apt to pursue cases where public discourse supports their actions. The debate thus raises an issue that, as philosopher of language, I have spent time considering: the impact of how words and terms are defined in the public sphere.   ""Lexical Warfare"" is a phrase that I like to use for battles over how a term is to be understood.  Our political discourse is full of such battles; it is pretty routine to find discussions of who gets to be called ""Republican"" (as opposed to RINO - Republican in Name Only), what ""freedom"" should mean, what legitimately gets to be called ""rape"" -and the list goes on. Lexical warfare is important because it can be a device to marginalize individuals within their self-identified political affiliation (for example, branding RINO's defines them as something other than true Republicans), or it can beguile us into ignoring true threats to freedom (focusing on threats from government while being blind to threats from corporations, religion and custom), and in cases in which the word in question is ""rape,"" the definition can have far reaching consequences for the rights of women and social policy.Lexical warfare is not exclusively concerned with changing the definitions of words and terms - it can also work to attach either a negative or positive affect to a term. Ronald Reagan and other conservatives successfully loaded the word ""liberal"" with negative connotations, while enhancing the positive aura of terms like ""patriot"" (few today would reject the label ""patriotic,"" but rather argue for why they are entitled to it). Over the past few years we've watched a lexical warfare battle slowly unfold in the treatment of the term ""hacktivism."" There has been an effort to redefine what the word means and what kinds of activities it describes; at the same time there has been an effort to tarnish the hacktivist label so that anyone who chooses to label themselves as such does so at their peril. In the simplest and broadest sense, a hacktivist is someone who uses technology hacking to effect social change. The conflict now is between those who want to change the meaning of the word to denote immoral, sinister activities and those who want to defend the broader, more inclusive understanding of hacktivist. Let's start with those who are trying to change the meaning so that it denotes sinister activities. Over the past year several newspapers and blogs have cited Verizon's 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report, which claimed that 58 percent of all data leaked in 2011 was owing to the actions of ""ideologically motivated hacktivists.""  An example of the concern was an article in Infosecurity Magazine: The year 2011 is renowned for being the year that hacktivists out-stole cybercriminals to take top honors according to the Verizon data breach report. Of the 174 million stolen records it tracked in 2011, 100 million were taken by hacktivist groups. Suddenly, things are looking black and white again. Regardless of political motivation or intent, if there are victims of the attacks they perpetrate, then hacktivism has crossed the line. Not OK. Meanwhile an article in ThreatPost proclaimed ""Anonymous: Hacktivists Steal Most Data in 2011."" The first thing to note is that both of these media sources are written by and for members of the information security business - it is in their interest to manufacture a threat, for the simple reason that threats mean business for these groups.  But is it fair to say that the threat is being ""manufactured""?  What of the Verizon report that they cite? The problem is that the headlines and articles, designed to tar hacktivists and make us fear them, did not reflect what the Verizon report actually said.  According to page 19 of the report only 3 percent of the data breaches in the survey were by hacktivists - the bulk of them were by routine cybercriminals, disgruntled employees and  nation states (83 percent were by organized criminals). The ""most data"" claim, while accurate, gives a skewed picture. According to Chris Novak, the Managing Principal of Investigative Response on Verizon's RISK Team, interviewed in ThreatPost, 2 percent of the 90 actions analyzed in the report accounted for 58 percent of the data released.  The interview with Novak suggests that this data loss came from precisely two hacktivist actions - both by spin-offs of the well-known hacktivist group Anonymous - and that these large data dumps stemmed from the actions against the security firm HB Gary Federal, which had publicly announced their efforts to expose Anonymous, and a computer security firm called Stratfor).  That means that in 2011 if you were worried about an intrusion into your system it was 33 times more likely that the perpetrator would be a criminal, nation state or disgruntled employee than a hacktivist. If you weren't picking fights with Anonymous the chances would have dropped to zero - at least according to the cases analyzed in the report. In effect, these infosecurity media outlets cited two actions by Anonymous spin-offs, implicated that actions like this were a principle project of hacktivism, and thereby implicated a larger, imminent threat of hacktivism.  Meanwhile, the meaning of hacktivist was being narrowed from people who use technology in support of social causes to meaning individuals principally concerned with infiltrating and releasing the data of almost anyone. Now let's turn to an attempt to maintain the broader understanding of hacktivism.  Several months ago I attended a birthday party in Germany for Daniel Domscheit-Berg, who was turning 34. As it happened, Domscheit-Berg had also been the spokesperson for Wikileaks and, after Julian Assange, the group's most visible person.  He had left the organization in 2010, and now he had a new venture, OpenLeaks. The party was also meant to be a coming out party for OpenLeaks. The party was to be held in the new headquarters and training center for OpenLeaks - a large house in a small town  about an hour outside of Berlin.  I was half-expecting to find a bunker full of hackers probing Web sites with SQL injections and sifting through State Department cables, but what I found was something else altogether. When I arrived at the house the first thing I noticed was a large vegetable garden outside.  The second thing I noticed was that a tree out front had been fitted out with a colorful knit wool sweater.  This was the effort of Daniel's wife Anke - ""knit hacking,"" she called it.  And around the small town I saw evidence of her guerilla knit hacking.  The steel poles of nearby street signs had also been fitted with woolen sweaters. Most impressively, though, a World War II tank, sitting outside a nearby former Nazi concentration camp for women had also been knit-hacked; the entire barrel of the tank's gun had been fit with a tight colorful wool sweater and adorned with some woolen flowers for good measure. I interpreted these knit-hackings as counteractions to the attempts to define hacktivist as something sinister; they serve as ostensive definitions of what hacktivism is and what hacktivists do. Of course the birthday party had elements of hackerdom understood more narrowly.  There were some members of the Chaos Computer Club (a legendary hacker group), and there was a healthy supply of Club Mate - the energy drink of choice of European hackers, but the main message being delivered was something else: a do-it-yourself  aesthetic - planting your own garden, knitting your own sweaters, foraging for mushrooms and counting on a local friend to bag you some venison.  What part of this lifestyle was the hacktivism part?  Daniel and his friends would like to say that all of it is. The intention here was clear: an attempt to defend the traditional, less sinister understanding of hacktivism and perhaps broaden it a bit, adding some positive affect to boot; more specifically, that hacking is fundamentally about refusing to be intimidated or cowed into submission by any technology, about understanding the technology and acquiring the power to repurpose it to our individual needs, and for the good of the many. Moreover, they were saying that a true hacktivist doesn't favor new technology over old - what is critical is that the technologies be in our hands rather than out of our control.  This ideal, theoretically, should extend to beyond computer use, to technologies for food production, shelter and clothing, and of course, to all the means we use to communicate with one another.  It would also, of course, extend to access to knowledge more generally - a value that was inherent in Aaron Swartz's hacking of the JSTOR data base. Our responsibility in this particular episode of lexical warfare is to be critical and aware of the public uses of language, and to be alert to what is at stake - whether the claims made by the infosecurity industry or the government, or the gestures by the hacktivists,  are genuine, misleading or correct. We are not passive observers in this dispute. The meaning of words is determined by those of us who use language, and it has consequences. Whether or not Aaron Swartz suffered because of the manipulation of the public discourse surrounding hacking, his case is a reminder that it is important that we be attuned to attempts to change the meanings of words in consequential ways.   It is important because we are the ones who will decide who will win.  Peter Ludlow is professor of philosophy at Northwestern University.  His most recent book is ""The Philosophy of Generative Linguistics.""    "
Aaron Swartz to Be Honored by Library Association,"The Internet activist Aaron Swartz will be awarded the American Library Association's James Madison Award on Friday as part of the group's Freedom of Information Day event at the Newseum in Washington, D.C.   Mr. Swartz, who committed suicide in January in the midst of a federal prosecution for document theft, will be honored for his efforts to promote open access to research and government information, according to the group's president, Maureen Sullivan.  ""Aaron had a deep commitment in all his work to support open access, which is a core value of libraries and so many people who use them,"" Ms. Sullivan said, adding: ""At times, it was beyond a passion."" As a teenager, Mr. Swartz designed code for the Creative Commons licensing system, helped to develop the RSS Web feed technology, and helped found the social news Web site Reddit. In 2008, he created a computer program that enabled free access to federal judicial documents. He is also the founder of Demand Progress, a group that promotes online social justice campaigns.  In 2011, Mr. Swartz was arrested and accused of hacking into the MIT computer system and stealing more than 4 million documents from JSTOR, a database of scientific and scholarly articles. Mr. Swartz was eventually charged with 13 felonies faced up to $1 million in fines and 35 years in prison, a penalty that many activists and others denounced overly harsh and that Mr. Swartz's family maintained caused his suicide.  The award to Mr. Swartz will be formally presented by U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat and a sponsor of  a bill introduced shortly after Mr. Swartz's death that would revise federal computer fraud law to prevent similar prosecutions. Ms. Lofgren, whose district includes Silicon Valley, herself received the award last year, in recognition of her co-sponsorship of the Federal Research Public Access Act and her efforts against the Stop Online Piracy Act, which Mr. Swartz also campaigned against. The Stop Online Piracy Act was withdrawn last year.  "
Adobe Breach Inadvertently Tied to Other Accounts,"This week, Ammon Bartram, a software engineer and co-founder of SocialCam, was talking to a friend about a recent security breach at Adobe in which hackers were able to gain access to tens of millions of encrypted passwords and email addresses. The friend, Mr. Bartram said, did not think anyone would be able to find out his pass code from the stolen data. ""I'll bet you $10 you can't figure it out,"" the friend said confidently.  Mr. Bartram went to a file-sharing website, downloaded a nearly 9-gigabyte file the Adobe hackers had posted online that is said to contain 150 million emails and encrypted passwords for Adobe user accounts, and began searching. Soon after, Mr. Bartram said in a phone interview, he informed his friend: ""Your password is 'dinosaur.'"" While he took glee in winning the $10 bet, Mr. Bartram was shocked by what he found during his search. ""I've been able to break roughly one out of every six passwords I attack. That's something like 25 million broken passwords, with associated emails,"" he said. ""This is a big deal. Due to password reuse, these passwords will give access to all sorts of accounts."" While Adobe ""hashed"" its passwords - which involves mashing up users' passwords with a mathematical algorithm - the company did not apply this level of security to people's e-mail addresses or the hints they use when they forget their passwords. So Mr. Bartram was able to search for his friend's email address, then copy the ""hashed"" version of the password and search for other people who used that same string of letters and numbers. He found 500 people with the same password as his friend, and then searched the nonencrypted hints that people had written if they forgot their password on the Adobe website. Adobe did not respond to a request for comment. Even more disturbing, he said, was the number of people who used the same password for their bank accounts, email, Facebook and home garage door codes as a password on the Adobe website. Some even used their Social Security numbers as passwords. In tens of thousands of instances people write a hint to themselves that says ""same as my Facebook password"" or ""same as my bank password."" Mr. Bartram said this could all have been much more difficult if Adobe had ""salted"" the data it stored on its users, meaning it would have appended random digits to the end of each hashed password to make it harder, but not impossible, for hackers to crack. Brian Krebs, an investigative reporter and security researcher with Krebs on Security who initially discovered the Adobe breach last month, said in a phone interview that Adobe did not put enough effort into securing its users' information. ""This is a perennial problem for most organizations, even the largest ones, which should know better, but they are still relying on approaches from a long time ago to protect people's passwords,"" Mr. Krebs said. And while Adobe appears not to have done well in protecting data, the problem is compounded by users who write password hints that tie back to their banks, home addresses and Social Security numbers. ""The best advice is for people not to recycle the same password in multiple places,"" Mr. Krebs said. ""It's prohibitively complex for hackers to crack passwords that are over 13 characters long; people have to think pass phrases instead of passwords."" Mr. Bartram said he found a number of email addresses tied to government institutions, including senate.gov. ""All of this happened because Adobe did not follow best practices for password storage,"" he said.  "
Who Is Selling Target's Data?,"We may be one step closer to knowing who was behind the security breach at Target that compromised 40 million customer records. On Tuesday, Brian Krebs, the security blogger who first broke the news that Target had been breached, said he believed he had identified a Ukranian man who he said was behind one of the primary black market sites now selling Target customers' credit and debit card information for as much as $100 a piece. Mr. Krebs lays out evidence that the man, Andrew Hodirevski, may be in touch with the criminals supplying Target's credit card data. There is no evidence that Mr. Hodirevski himself is behind the Target breach.  Through some impressive Internet sleuthing, Mr. Krebs said he tracked Mr. Hodirevski to Rescator, the online alias for the person behind Rescator.la, an underground website that is currently selling Target's stolen credit card data. (Other sites, including Kaddafi.hk, Octavian.su and cheapdumps.org, are also selling this information.) After tying the alias Rescator to Rescator.la, Mr. Krebs said he found a now deleted comment from Rescator in an August 2011 forum in which he introduces himself as ""Hel,"" one of the three founders of darklife.ws, a now defunct hacker forum. After Hel and two other founders of that forum hacked a well-respected Russian hacking forum, its founders suffered a retaliatory counterattack in which hackers posted photos of Darklife's founders - including one they identified as ""Helkern""- online. Mr. Krebs found an instant messaging name, email address and several postings by the alias Helkern online, including one posted to a Russian gaming forum, in which Helkern identifies his location as Odessa, Ukraine. Further snooping revealed that Helkern's web address was registered to Andrew Hodirevski in Odessa, Ukraine. Other online profile pictures for an Andrew Hodirevski in Odessa matched the pictures exposed in the counterattack. Mr. Krebs uncovered a now defunct, 2010 profile for Mr. Hodirevski in which he lists his personal goals as getting married to his girlfriend, buying a $20,000 Toyota Solara, moving to Helsinki and world domination. ""I have no idea if Rescator/Helkern/Andrew was involved in hacking Target, but it's a good bet that he at least knows who was,"" Mr. Krebs said. An email to Mr. Hodirevski requesting comment on Mr. Krebs's post was not returned. Mr. Krebs tried to reach Mr. Hodirevski and received one email reply from an individual who said he could relay Mr. Krebs' questions to Mr. Hodirevski. When Mr. Krebs did not receive a response to his original questions, he pinged the individual again Tuesday morning. This time, the person offered Mr. Krebs $10,000 not to post his article. ""Obviously, I did not take him up on his offer,"" Mr. Krebs wrote. A Target spokeswoman said in an email on Tuesday that the retailer was still working with the Secret Service and Department of Justice in the forensic and criminal investigation into its breach. Already jittery Target customers were starting to feel the pinch after JP Morgan Chase said it was limiting customers who had used their debit cards at Target stores to $100 a day in withdrawals and $300 purchases in the days just before Christmas.

"Bank Hacks Were Work Of Iranians, Officials Say","SAN FRANCISCO -- The attackers hit one American bank after the next. As in so many previous attacks, dozens of online banking sites slowed, hiccupped or ground to a halt before recovering several minutes later. But there was something disturbingly different about the wave of online attacks on American banks in recent weeks. Security researchers say that instead of exploiting individual computers, the attackers engineered networks of computers in data centers, transforming the online equivalent of a few yapping Chihuahuas into a pack of fire-breathing Godzillas. The skill required to carry out attacks on this scale has convinced United States government officials and security researchers that they are the work of Iran, most likely in retaliation for economic sanctions and online attacks by the United States.  ''There is no doubt within the U.S. government that Iran is behind these attacks,'' said James A. Lewis, a former official in the State and Commerce Departments and a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Mr. Lewis said the amount of traffic flooding American banking sites was ''multiple times'' the amount that Russia directed at Estonia in a monthlong online assault in 2007 that nearly crippled the Baltic nation. American officials have not offered any technical evidence to back up their claims, but computer security experts say the recent attacks showed a level of sophistication far beyond that of amateur hackers. Also, the hackers chose to pursue disruption, not money: another earmark of state-sponsored attacks, the experts said. ''The scale, the scope and the effectiveness of these attacks have been unprecedented,'' said Carl Herberger, vice president of security solutions at Radware, a security firm that has been investigating the attacks on behalf of banks and cloud service providers. ''There have never been this many financial institutions under this much duress.'' Since September, intruders have caused major disruptions to the online banking sites of Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&T and HSBC. They employed DDoS attacks, or distributed denial of service attacks, named because hackers deny customers service by directing large volumes of traffic to a site until it collapses. No bank accounts were breached and no customers' money was taken. By using data centers, the attackers are simply keeping up with the times. Companies and consumers are increasingly conducting their business over large-scale ''clouds'' of hundreds, even thousands, of networked computer servers. These clouds are run by Amazon and Google, but also by many smaller players who commonly rent them to other companies. It appears the hackers remotely hijacked some of these clouds and used the computing power to take down American banking sites. ''There's a sense now that attackers are crafting their own private clouds,'' either by creating networks of individual machines or by stealing resources wholesale from poorly maintained corporate clouds, said John Kindervag, an analyst at Forrester Research. How, exactly, attackers are hijacking data centers is still a mystery. Making matters more complex, they have simultaneously introduced another weapon: encrypted DDoS attacks. Banks encrypt customers' online transactions for security, but the encryption process consumes system resources. By flooding banking sites with encryption requests, attackers can further slow or cripple sites with fewer requests. A hacker group calling itself Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has claimed in online posts that it was responsible for the attacks. The group said it attacked the banks in retaliation for an anti-Islam video that mocked the Prophet Muhammad, and pledged to continue its campaign until the video was scrubbed from the Internet. It called the campaign Operation Ababil, a reference to a story in the Koran in which Allah sends swallows to defeat an army of elephants dispatched by the king of Yemen to attack Mecca in A.D. 571. But American intelligence officials say the group is actually a cover for Iran. They claim Iran is waging the attacks in retaliation for Western economic sanctions and for a series of cyberattacks on its own systems. In the last three years, three sophisticated computer viruses -- called Flame, Duqu and Stuxnet -- have hit computers in Iran. The New York Times reported last year that the United States, together with Israel, was responsible for Stuxnet, the virus used to destroy centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility in 2010. ''It's a bit of a grudge match,'' said Mr. Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Researchers at Radware who investigated the attacks for several banks found that the traffic was coming from data centers around the world. They discovered that various cloud services and public Web hosting services had been infected with a particularly sophisticated form of malware, called Itsoknoproblembro, that was designed to evade detection by antivirus programs. The malware has existed for years, but the banking attacks were the first time it used data centers to attack external victims. Botnets, or networks of individual infected slave computers, can typically be traced back to a command and control center, but security experts say Itsoknoproblembro was engineered to make it very difficult to tie it to one party. Security researchers have come up with a new name for servers infected with Itsoknoproblembro: they call them ''bRobots.'' In an amateur botnet, the command and control center can be easily identified, but Mr. Herberger said it had been nearly impossible to do so in this case, suggesting to him that ''the campaign may be state-sponsored versus amateur malware.'' Attackers used the infected servers to fire traffic simultaneously at each banking site until it slowed or collapsed. By infecting data centers instead of computers, the hackers obtained the computing power to mount enormous denial of service attacks. One of the banks had 40 gigabits of Internet capacity, Mr. Herberger said, a huge amount when you consider that a midsize business may only have one gigabit. But some banks were hit with a sustained flood of traffic that peaked at 70 gigabits. Mr. Herberger declined to say which cloud service providers had been compromised, citing nondisclosure agreements with Radware's clients, but he said that each new bank attack provided evidence that more data centers had been infected and exploited. The attackers said last week that they had no intention of halting their campaign. ''Officials of American banks must expect our massive attacks,'' they wrote. ''From now on, none of the U.S. banks will be safe.'' "
"How M.I.T. Ensnared a Hacker, Bucking a Freewheeling Culture","In the early days of 2011, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology learned that it had an intruder. Worse, it believed the intruder had been there before. Months earlier, the mysterious visitor had used the school's computer network to begin copying millions of research articles belonging to Jstor, the nonprofit organization that sells subscription access to universities. The visitor was clever -- switching identifications to avoid being blocked by M.I.T.'s security system -- but eventually the university believed it had shut down the intrusion, then spent weeks reassuring furious officials at Jstor that the downloading had been stopped. However, on Jan. 3, 2011, according to internal M.I.T. documents obtained by The New York Times, the university was informed that the intruder was back -- this time downloading documents very slowly, with a new method of access, so as not to alert the university's security experts.  ''The user was now not using any of the typical methods to access MITnet to avoid all usual methods of being disabled,'' concluded Mike Halsall, a senior security analyst at M.I.T., referring to the university's computer network. What the university officials did not know at the time was that the intruder was Aaron Swartz, one of the shining lights of the technology world and a leading advocate for open access to information, with a fellowship down the road at Harvard. Mr. Swartz's actions presented M.I.T. with a crucial choice: the university could try to plug the weak spot in its network or it could try to catch the hacker, then unknown. The decision -- to treat the downloading as a continuing crime to be investigated rather than a security threat that had been stopped -- led to a two-day cat-and-mouse game with Mr. Swartz and, ultimately, to charges of computer and wire fraud. Mr. Swartz, 26, who faced a potentially lengthy prison term and whose trial was to begin in April, was found dead of an apparent suicide in his Brooklyn apartment on Jan. 11. Mr. Swartz's supporters called M.I.T.'s decision a striking step for an institution that prides itself on operating an open computer network and open campus -- the home of a freewheeling programming culture. M.I.T.'s defenders viewed the intrusion as a computer crime that needed to be taken seriously. M.I.T. declined to confirm any of these details or comment on its actions during the investigation. The university's president, L. Rafael Reif, said last week, ''It pains me to think that M.I.T. played any role in a series of events that have ended in tragedy.'' He appointed a professor, Hal Abelson, to analyze M.I.T.'s conduct in the investigation. To comment now, a spokeswoman for the university said, would be ''to get ahead of that analysis.'' Early on Jan. 4, at 8:08 a.m., according to Mr. Halsall's detailed internal timeline of the events, a security expert was able to locate that new method of access precisely -- the wiring in a network closet in the basement of Building 16, a nondescript rectangular structure full of classrooms and labs that, like many buildings on campus, is kept unlocked. In the closet, Mr. Halsall wrote, there was a netbook, or small portable computer, ''hidden under a box,'' connected to an external hard drive that was receiving the downloaded documents. At 9:44 a.m. the M.I.T. police were called in; by 10:30 a.m., the Cambridge police were en route, and by 11 a.m., Michael Pickett, a Secret Service agent and expert on computer crime, was on the scene. On his recommendation, a surveillance camera was installed in the closet and a second laptop was connected to the network switch to track the traffic. There may have been a reason for the university's response. According to the timeline, the tech team detected brief activity from China on the netbook -- something that occurs all the time but still represents potential trouble. E-mails among M.I.T. officials that Tuesday in January 2011 highlight the pressures university officials felt over a problem they thought they had solved. Ann J. Wolpert, the director of libraries, wrote to Ellen Finnie Duranceau, the official who was receiving Jstor's complaints: ''Has there ever been a situation similar to this when we brought in campus police? The magnitude, systematic and careful nature of the abuses could be construed as approaching criminal action. Certainly, that's how Jstor views it.'' Some of Mr. Swartz's defenders argue that collecting and providing evidence to the government without a warrant may have violated federal and state wiretapping statutes. ''This was a pivotal moment,'' said Elliot Peters, Mr. Swartz's lawyer. ''They could have decided, we're going to unplug this computer, take it off the network and tell the police to get a warrant.'' Mr. Peters had persuaded a judge to hear his arguments that the evidence collected from the netbook be excluded from the trial, asserting that Mr. Swartz's Fourth Amendment protections from unlawful search and seizure had been violated. (All charges against Mr. Swartz were dropped after his death.) Investigators first caught sight of Mr. Swartz on camera the day it was installed. At 3:26 p.m., the timeline notes, the ''suspect is seen on camera entering network closet, noticeably unaware of what had occurred all morning.'' But Mr. Swartz managed to leave before the police could arrive. Also, ''on his way out, the suspect shuts off the lights,'' the timeline reports, which ''will hurt video quality and possibly work against the motion activation of the camera.'' A technician quickly turned them back on. Mr. Swartz certainly knew his way around the M.I.T. campus -- as his defense pointed out in court, he had given a guest lecture there, he had many friends on campus, and his father, Bob Swartz, remains as a consultant at the university's Media Lab. Two days later, the timeline notes that Aaron Swartz ''enters network closet while covering his face with bike helmet, presumably thinking video cameras may be in hallway.'' More seriously for the M.I.T. investigation, ''once inside and with the door closed, he hurriedly removes his netbook, hard drive and network cable and stows them in his backpack.'' He was gone within two minutes, too quickly for the police to catch him. Perhaps suspecting he was being watched, Mr. Swartz moved the computer. But M.I.T.'s tech team believed it had tracked it to the fourth floor of the same Building 16. The university called for ''police presence.'' A little after 2 p.m., according to the government, Mr. Swartz was spotted heading down Massachusetts Avenue within a mile of M.I.T. After being questioned by an M.I.T. police officer, he dropped his bike and ran (according to the M.I.T. timeline, he was stopped by an M.I.T. police captain and Mr. Pickett). He was carrying a data storage device with a program on it, the government says, that tied him to the netbook. The arrest shocked friends of Mr. Swartz, as well as M.I.T. alumni. Brewster Kahle, an M.I.T. graduate and founder of the digital library Internet Archive, where Mr. Swartz gave programming assistance, wrote: ''When I was at M.I.T., if someone went to hack the system, say by downloading databases to play with them, might be called a hero, get a degree, and start a company. But they called the cops on him. Cops.'' Mr. Swartz turned over his hard drives with 4.8 million documents, and Jstor declined to pursue the case. But Carmen M. Ortiz, the United States attorney in Boston, decided to press on. The government has defended M.I.T.'s decision to ''collaborate'' with the federal investigation and argued there was no need for a warrant because, as a trespasser on M.I.T.'s campus, Mr. Swartz had no reasonable expectation of privacy for his netbook. And M.I.T.'s officials were rightfully concerned, the government argued, by the threat they faced. ''M.I.T. had to identify the hacker and assist with his apprehension in order to prevent further abuse,'' the government argued in court. Michael Sussmann, a Washington lawyer and a former federal prosecutor of computer crime, said that M.I.T. was the victim and that, without more information, it had to assume any hackers were ''the Chinese, even though it's a 16-year-old with acne.'' Once the police were called in, the university could not back away from the investigation. ''After there's a referral, victims don't have the opportunity to change their mind.'' Mr. Swartz's father, in a telephone interview, described himself as ''devastated'' by M.I.T.'s conduct during the investigation of his son. ''M.I.T. claimed they were neutral -- but we don't believe they acted in a neutral way,'' he said, adding, ''My belief is they put their institutional concerns first.'' He described attending two meetings with the chancellor of M.I.T., Eric Grimson. Each time there also was a representative of the general counsel's office. At both meetings, he said, members of M.I.T.'s legal team assured him and the chancellor that the government had compelled M.I.T. to collect and hand over the material. In that first meeting, he recalled, ''I said to the chancellor, 'Why are you destroying my son?' He said, 'We are not.' '' "
"Wall Street Journal Announces That It Was Hacked by the Chinese, Too","One day after The New York Times reported that Chinese hackers had infiltrated its computers and stolen passwords for its employees, The Wall Street Journal announced that it too had been hacked. On Thursday, The Journal reported that it had been attacked by Chinese hackers who were trying to monitor the company's coverage of China. It said hackers had broken into its network through computers in its Beijing bureau. In a written statement, the business newspaper owned by News Corporation described the attack as an ''ongoing issue'' and said it was working closely with authorities and security specialists to clean up its systems. It said that it completed a ''network overhaul'' on Thursday in an effort to rid its systems of hackers.  China's Ministry of National Defense has denied any involvement in the cyberattack at The Times or any other American corporations. But security experts said that in 2008, Chinese hackers began targeting American news organizations as part of an effort to monitor coverage of Chinese issues. In a report for clients in December, Mandiant, a computer security company, said that over the course of several investigations it found evidence that Chinese hackers had stolen e-mails, contacts and files from more than 30 journalists and executives at Western news organizations, and had maintained a ''short list'' of journalists for repeated attacks. Among those targeted were journalists who had written about Chinese leaders, political and legal issues in China and the telecom giant Huawei. Bloomberg News, another American news organization, was targeted by Chinese hackers last year, and some computers were infected, according to a person with knowledge of the company's internal investigation. The attack occurred after Bloomberg published an article on June 29 about the wealth accumulated by relatives of Xi Jinping, a Chinese official who is expected to become president in March. Bloomberg has confirmed that hackers had made attempts but said that ''no computer systems or computers were compromised.'' The timing of the attacks on The New York Times coincided with the reporting for an investigation, published online on Oct. 25, that found that the relatives of Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister, had accumulated a fortune worth several billion dollars through business dealings. Security experts hired by The Times to detect and block the computer attacks found digital evidence that Chinese hackers, using methods that some consultants have associated with the Chinese military in the past, breached The Times's network. The Associated Press reported Thursday that officials in the Obama administration were considering more assertive action against Beijing to stop Chinese computer espionage campaigns. The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, said Thursday a global effort was needed o establish ''rules of the road'' for cyber activity. In her final meeting with reporters at the State Department, Mrs. Clinton addressed a question about China's efforts to infiltrate computer systems at The New York Times. ''We have seen over the last years an increase in not only the hacking attempts on government institutions but also non-governmental ones,'' Mrs. Clinton said. The Chinese, she said, ''are not the only people who are hacking us.'' ''There is a lot that we are working on that will be deployed in the event that we don't get some kind of international effort under way,'' Mrs. Clinton added without elaborating. The United States has been increasingly vocal about such efforts against government and private industry. In a November 2011 intelligence report, government officials specifically accused China and Russia of stealing intellectual property for economic gain. "
Report Sees Journalists Increasingly Under Attack,"A leading press advocacy group reported an alarming rise in the number of journalists killed and imprisoned around the world in 2012, attributing the trend to repressive laws, government intolerance of dissent and outright impunity for the killers that are endangering independent reporting in many countries.  In its annual ''Attacks on the Press'' survey, which was released on Thursday, the group, the Committee to Protect Journalists, said 70 journalists had been killed while doing their jobs in 2012, which is a 43 percent increase over the year earlier, and that more than 35 journalists had disappeared. The group said that in 2012 it had identified 232 journalists who had been imprisoned, 53 more than a year earlier and the highest number since the survey began in 1990. ''It's a sad year for press freedom,'' Robert Mahoney, the group's deputy director, said at a news conference held at the United Nations. ''From Mexico to Syria, Russia to Pakistan, journalists on the front lines are confronting violence and repression as never before.'' Mr. Mahoney said the killing of journalists in Pakistan, Somalia and Brazil stood out last year, reflecting what he called an entrenched culture of impunity that gives the killers the confidence they will not be held accountable by the law. ''There is no greater threat to investigative journalists than impunity,'' he said. The appraisal also noted that 28 journalists were killed in Syria last year, making it the deadliest country for news reporting. Somalia was No. 2 with 12 journalists killed, followed by Pakistan with 7. This year for the first time, the group compiled what it called a Risk List of countries where it had documented worrisome trends. Besides Pakistan, Somalia and Brazil, the group included Ecuador, Turkey and Russia for the use of restrictive laws to quiet dissent. Turkey, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Iran and Syria were cited for the imprisonment of journalists. Mr. Mahoney also said that cyberattacks on journalists and news organizations had increased markedly over the past few years, describing the practice as inexpensive and easy censorship. Among the most common cyberattacks is a so-called denial-of-service attack, in which hackers overwhelm a news organization's operations by flooding it with information. He cited the examples of recent attacks on The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal that were traced to China, but said many other lesser-known news organizations as well as individual journalists, in Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere, had been subjected to cyberattacks. Mr. Mahoney said ''the right to receive and impart information transcends borders, and international and regional bodies have a key role to play in upholding these principles, which are under attack.'' "
"In Wake of Cyberattacks, China Seeks New Rules","SHANGHAI -- China has issued a new call for international ''rules and cooperation'' on Internet espionage issues, while insisting that accusations of Chinese government involvement in recent hacking attacks were part of an international smear campaign.  The remarks, by Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, were China's highest-level response yet to intensifying reports that the Chinese military may be engaging in cyberespionage. ''Anyone who tries to fabricate or piece together a sensational story to serve a political motive will not be able to blacken the name of others nor whitewash themselves,'' he said. Speaking to the news media on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People's Congress on Saturday, Mr. Yang said that the reports were ''built on shaky ground'' and that cyberspace should not be turned into a battlefield. Beijing has stepped up its response to the attacks in recent weeks, saying that China is often the victim of such attacks. Although security experts have found evidence that many of the most aggressive attacks can be traced back to Internet addresses inside China, the Chinese military recently said that attacks on its own computers were linked to Internet addresses in the United States. Many experts on the issue acknowledge that it is difficult to pinpoint the origins of attacks. However, some experts in the United States and Canada say there is more and more evidence that the attacks on Western governments and multinational companies are coming from China and that the data that is being retrieved seems to involve issues of concern to the Chinese government. American intelligence officials have also said privately that they have evidence of Chinese government involvement in the attacks, and the White House is expected to press Beijing on the issue. "
Security Chief Says Cyberattacks Will Meet With Retaliation,"WASHINGTON -- The chief of the military's newly created Cyber Command told Congress on Tuesday that he is establishing 13 teams of programmers and computer experts who could carry out offensive cyberattacks on foreign nations if the United States were hit with a major attack on its own networks, the first time the Obama administration has publicly admitted to developing such weapons for use in wartime. ''I would like to be clear that this team, this defend-the-nation team, is not a defensive team,'' Gen. Keith Alexander, who runs both the National Security Agency and the new Cyber Command, told the House Armed Services Committee. ''This is an offensive team that the Defense Department would use to defend the nation if it were attacked in cyberspace. Thirteen of the teams that we're creating are for that mission alone.'' General Alexander's testimony came on the same day the nation's top intelligence official, James R. Clapper Jr., warned Congress that a major cyberattack on the United States could cripple the country's infrastructure and economy, and suggested that such attacks now pose the most dangerous immediate threat to the United States, even more pressing than an attack by global terrorist networks.  On Monday, Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, demanded that Chinese authorities investigate such attacks and enter talks about new rules governing behavior in cyberspace. General Alexander has been a major architect of the American strategy on this issue, but until Tuesday he almost always talked about it in defensive terms. He has usually deflected questions about America's offensive capability, and turned them into discussions of how to defend against mounting computer espionage from China and Russia, and the possibility of crippling attacks on utilities, cellphone networks and other infrastructure. He was also a crucial player in the one major computer attack the United States is known to have sponsored in recent years, aimed at Iran's nuclear enrichment plants. He did not discuss that highly classified operation during his open testimony. Mr. Clapper, the director of national intelligence, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that American spy agencies saw only a ''remote chance'' in the next two years of a major computer attack on the United States, which he defined as an operation that ''would result in long-term, wide-scale disruption of services, such as a regional power outage.'' Mr. Clapper appeared with the heads of several other intelligence agencies, including Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the F.B.I. director Robert S. Mueller III, and the C.I.A. director John O. Brennan, to present their annual assessment of the threats facing the nation. It was the first time that Mr. Clapper listed cyberattacks first in his presentation to Congress, and the rare occasion since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that intelligence officials did not list international terrorism first in the catalog of dangers facing the United States. ''In some cases,'' Mr. Clapper said in his testimony, ''the world is applying digital technologies faster than our ability to understand the security implications and mitigate potential risks.'' He said it was unlikely that Russia and China would launch ''devastating'' cyberattacks against the United States in the near future, but he said foreign spy services had already hacked the computer networks of government agencies, businesses and private companies. Two specific attacks Mr. Clapper listed, an August 2012 attack against the Saudi oil company Aramco and attacks on American banks and stock exchanges last year, are believed by American intelligence officials to have been the work of Iran. General Alexander picked up on the same themes in his testimony, saying that he was adding 40 cyber teams, 13 focused on offense and 27 on training and surveillance. When pressed, he said that the best defense hinged on being able to monitor incoming traffic to the United States through private ''Internet service providers,'' which could alert the government, in the milliseconds that electronic messages move, about potentially dangerous attacks. Such surveillance is bound to raise more debate with privacy advocates, who fear government monitoring of the origin and the addressing data on most e-mail messages and other computer exchanges. Traditional threats occupied much of Mr. Clapper's testimony. American intelligence officials are giving new emphasis to the danger posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs, which are said for the first time to ''pose a serious threat to the United States'' as well as to its East Asian neighbors. North Korea, which recently made a series of belligerent statements after its third nuclear test, has displayed an intercontinental missile that can be moved by road and in December launched a satellite atop a Taepodong-2 launch vehicle, Mr. Clapper's prepared statement noted. ''The rhetoric, while it is propaganda laced, is also an indicator of their attitude and perhaps their intent,'' Mr. Clapper said during one exchange with a lawmaker, adding that he was concerned that North Korea ''could initiate a provocative action against the South.'' In his discussion of terrorism, Mr. Clapper noted that while Al Qaeda's core in Pakistan ''is probably unable to carry out complex, large-scale attacks in the West,'' spinoffs still posed a threat. Listed first is the affiliate in Yemen, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which Mr. Clapper said had retained its goal of attacks on United States soil, but he also noted militant groups in six other countries that still threaten local violence. Mr. Clapper began his remarks by criticizing policy makers for the current budget impasse, saying that the budget cuts known as sequestration will force American spy agencies to make sharp reductions in classified programs and to furlough employees. The classified intelligence budget has ballooned over the past decade, and Mr. Clapper compared the current round of cuts to the period during the 1990s when the end of the cold war led to drastic reductions in the C.I.A.'s budget. ''Unlike more directly observable sequestration impacts, like shorter hours at public parks or longer security lines at airports, the degradation of intelligence will be insidious,'' Mr. Clapper said. ''It will be gradual and almost invisible unless and until, of course, we have an intelligence failure.'' The threat hearing is the only scheduled occasion each year when the spy chiefs present open testimony to Congress about the dangers facing the United States, and Mr. Clapper did not hide the fact that he is opposed to the annual ritual. President Obama devoted part of his State of the Union address to a pledge of greater transparency with the Congress and the American public, but Mr. Clapper, a 71-year-old retired Air Force general, made it clear that he saw few benefits of more public disclosure. ''An open hearing on intelligence matters is something of a contradiction in terms,'' he said. "
Web Site Investigated For Posting Private Data,"WASHINGTON -- Law enforcement officials said on Tuesday that they had opened an investigation into a Web site that posted the home addresses, Social Security numbers and other personal information for more than a dozen celebrities and politicians, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Michelle Obama and Jay-Z.  ''At this point, we are trying to determine the sourcing of this and the validity of the stuff that is being posted,'' said a senior federal law enforcement official. The investigation is being led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service and the Los Angeles Police Department, law enforcement officials said. One said the authorities were looking at whether Russian hackers were involved. The site -- Exposed: The Secret Files -- included the Internet suffix ''.su'' -- an indication that it was originally from the Soviet Union. It linked to a Twitter account that included postings in Russian. At the bottom of the Web page was a list of the people whom the hackers claimed to have compromised, including Chief Charlie Beck of the Los Angeles Police Department, Beyoncé, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., former Vice President Al Gore and Kim Kardashian. Some of the information can be readily found through public records searches, but other information exceeded what can normally be found online. For instance, the hackers posted a home address, Social Security number, birth date and link to what appeared to be a complete credit report for Mr. Holder. Credit-reporting agencies, including Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, said Tuesday that hackers had used private information to gain access to their credit reports from third-party sites like annualcreditreport.com, a free service. ''There is a stringent credentialing process for those sites,'' said Tim Klein, a vice president at Equifax. He said that to get to those reports, hackers must have used stolen personally identifiable information -- like a person's Social Security number and mortgage provider -- to authenticate themselves and gain access to credit reports. Parts of the credit reports confirmed information that has been previously disclosed about the Obamas. Mrs. Obama's credit report showed that she paid off her college loans in January 2003. The credit report also showed that she had Banana Republic and Gap credit cards and that she was 30 days overdue on a payment in July 2008, when Mr. Obama was running for president. Security experts said such attacks are on the rise because of lax security by companies that hold confidential information and because consumers use easy-to-crack passwords online. ''Forget the F.B.I. and the banks,'' said Mark Risher, chief executive at Impermium, a start-up that aims to clean up social networks. ''The problem we're seeing is that sensitive information is being pulled from less-defended sites like social networks and dating services.'' By Tuesday afternoon, more than 250,000 people had visited the site. "
DDoS,"Last week, a dispute between an antispam enforcer and a spam provider escalated into one of the largest Internet attacks in history -- what specialists call a DDoS, for distributed denial of service, in which a service like the ability to visit a Web site or use a network is denied because of deliberate congestion. In this case, a powerful stream of data, peaking at 300 billion bits per second, made some sites unavailable and slowed networks around the world. In some cases the slowdown lasted for as long as nine days.  How is a small group -- perhaps even a single individual -- able to wreak so much havoc? The Internet makes it possible for computer vandals to easily harness thousands of computers to simultaneously send streams of data to a single address. If there is enough data, even the largest Web services buckle under the load and become unresponsive. More advanced DDoS attacks use a trick called amplification. Streams of simple Internet queries are sent from a false address, which is actually the location of the attack's target. When Web services respond, sometimes with large blocks of data, they create devastating digital fire hoses. Millions of computers on the Internet can be compromised and turned into ''zombies.'' One partial solution is for Internet providers to make sure that messages being sent from their networks are actually coming from the Internet addresses of their users. That would not eliminate DDoS, but it would make it harder for attacks to be amplified. "
Times Site Is Attacked By Hackers,"The New York Times Company was a victim of online attacks earlier this week that slowed down The New York Times Web site and limited access to articles and other types of content.  According to Danielle Rhoades Ha, a company spokeswoman, the Web site became unavailable to ''a small number of users'' after a denial-of-service attack, a tactic used by hackers to slow or halt Web traffic by bombarding a host site with requests for information. She added that the company did not ''have confirmation on who is responsible for the most recent attacks on nytimes.com.'' The announcement follows attacks that were made on The Times's site late last year. In January, the newspaper announced that its computer systems had been infiltrated by Chinese hackers who found passwords for reporters and other employees. The attacks took place as The Times investigated the relatives of Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister, and how they had built up a multibillion-dollar fortune during his political tenure. David Barboza, the author of the article, won a Pulitzer Prize. Attacks on media organizations are not unique to The Times. Shortly after the January announcement by The Times, officials at The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post also reported that their Web sites had been attacked by Chinese hackers. On Friday, the Syrian Electronic Army said it had hacked the Web site and several Twitter accounts that belonged to The Financial Times. In the past, it has attacked other media companies, including The Associated Press and The Onion. "
Former Hacker Testifies at Private's Court-Martial,"FORT MEADE, Md. -- Adrian Lamo, the former computer hacker who reported Pfc. Bradley Manning to military authorities in May 2010 after Private Manning confided that he had provided vast archives of secret government documents to WikiLeaks, testified at the soldier's court-martial on Tuesday that he saw parallels between his own youthful hacking offenses and those of the young Army intelligence analyst. Mr. Lamo, who testified for about half an hour, has been a polarizing figure in the WikiLeaks case. He is despised by many of Private Manning's supporters for betraying the trust of a person they see as an important whistle-blower; Mr. Lamo has maintained that turning Private Manning in was the socially responsible thing to do because his wholesale leaking recklessly endangered others.  Mr. Lamo, who wore black clothing and a light beard, recounted how Private Manning sent him an encrypted e-mail from his personal Google e-mail account, and later contacted him via an online chat service around May 20, 2010. The two later connected on Facebook as well, but did not meet in person. Mr. Lamo said he first contacted a government official the day after the first online conversation, while continuing to chat online with Private Manning over the next week -- sometimes from his home in California, and sometimes from two nearby Starbucks where there was Internet access. The last chat, he said, was around May 26; soon after, Private Manning was arrested. When Mr. Lamo was 22 -- the same age Private Manning was when he sent the information to WikiLeaks -- he hacked into the networks of several companies, including The New York Times. He pleaded guilty in 2004 to the offenses and was sentenced to six months of house arrest and two years of probation. He has since become a network threat analyst, and in 1998 he was appointed to a San Francisco government task force on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth issues. During cross-examination, Private Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, focused on the portions of the chat logs showing that his client had reached out to Mr. Lamo at a time when he was struggling with his own sexual identity, had just spent several months downloading government secrets and sending them to WikiLeaks, and was scared and in turmoil. Mr. Coombs raised the parallels between Private Manning and Mr. Lamo, asking whether, based on their conversations, Mr. Lamo had seen ''someone very familiar'' to himself, a ''young 22-year-old with good intentions like you were?'' Mr. Lamo replied, ''That was not lost on me.'' Asked if Private Manning had represented himself as a person who tried to investigate to find out the truth about matters, Mr. Lamo said, ''Something that I could appreciate, yes.'' Mr. Lamo answered with a simple ''yes'' to many other questions, like whether Private Manning had described some of the documents as exposing casualties in Iraq and whether he had expressed hope that his disclosures would prompt worldwide discussions and reforms. He also acknowledged asking Private Manning why he did not sell the documents to a foreign government, and said Private Manning had replied that the information should be public. But he also distanced himself from some of Private Manning's assertions in the chat logs. For example, asked if Private Manning had also told him how the more than 250,000 diplomatic cables he had leaked ''explained in detail how first world countries exploited third world countries,'' Mr. Lamo replied, ''He made that representation, yes.'' After Mr. Coombs finished, a prosecutor got Mr. Lamo to agree that Private Manning had mentioned Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, and asked whether the private had admitted ''to compromising classified information at the thousands of documents level.'' ''Yes, he did,'' Mr. Lamo replied. Private Manning, now 25, sat quietly as the opposing lawyers questioned Mr. Lamo. He did not turn his head to watch as Mr. Lamo, who had testified at a pretrial hearing as well, walked out of the courtroom after being excused from the witness stand. Mr. Lamo later posted on Twitter a picture of a subpoena requiring him to appear and wrote: ''My work here is done. Elsewhere, just beginning.'' There was a sharp drop from Monday in the presence of news organizations and protesters at the trial, which opened Monday at this military base near Baltimore, as it shifted from the drama of the opening statements toward chain-of-custody issues and other evidentiary matters. Mr. Lamo said he had allowed federal agents to take a hard drive from a laptop and a second computer he used for the chats, where the transcripts were automatically saved by the program he was using. He said he did not alter those transcripts, but did make copies of them and redact some portions before sending them to reporters for Wired magazine and The Washington Post. A forensic computer analyst also testified that he had recovered matching chat logs on computers belonging to Mr. Lamo and Private Manning covering May 21 to May 25, 2010. In addition, a former instructor testified that he trained Private Manning in 2008 to protect classified secrets and not to post information on the Internet that could help adversaries. He said Private Manning had stood out because he asked many questions in class and was the butt of jokes by classmates. A former sergeant who oversaw Private Manning's training unit, Brian Madrid, recalled an incident in which Private Manning drew scrutiny for making a YouTube video describing his schedule and training; it used terms like ''Top Secret'' although it did not include any secrets. Mr. Madrid required him to make a class presentation on protecting operational information. Afterward, Private Manning said it would not happen again. A prosecutor asked Mr. Madrid whether it had happened again. ''I believe so -- that's why we're here,'' he replied. "
Police Arrest Suspect in Large-Scale Web Attack,"SERRAVAL, FRANCE -- A man suspected of involvement in a large-scale online attack against an Internet spam-fighting service has been returned to his native country, the Netherlands, and ordered to remain in custody as an investigation proceeds.  The suspect, Sven Olaf Kamphuis, was transferred to the Netherlands from Spain on Monday after having been arrested at his home in Barcelona last month, according to the Dutch authorities. On Wednesday, a judge in Rotterdam ordered that Mr. Kamphuis remain in custody for up to two weeks as a police investigation proceeds, said Wim de Bruin, a spokesman for the Dutch national prosecutor's office. ''He is being held on suspicion of participating in DDoS,'' Mr. de Bruin said, referring to distributed denial of service attacks, a criminal offense under Dutch law. The attacks slowed Internet service globally for several days in April, especially in Russia and other European countries. The attacks in question, which crested last month, took aim at the Web site of Spamhaus, a group that provides e-mail services and other clients with lists of suspected spammers. In March, Spamhaus added two concerns run by Mr. Kamphuis -- a Web hosting service called CyberBunker and an Internet service provider called CB3ROB -- to its blacklist. Though Mr. Kamphuis has solicited support for action against Spamhaus in postings on Facebook, he has denied participating directly in the attacks. He has not been charged with any crime. The Dutch police can hold Mr. Kamphuis for up to two weeks; at that point, with a further court ruling, they could keep him in custody for up to 90 additional days without filing any charges. "
"In Swartz Tribute, Hackers Attack M.I.T. Site","Anonymous, the loose collective of hackers, attacked the Web site of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Sunday, in a tribute to Aaron Swartz, the 26-year-old technology programmer who killed himself on Friday.  Mr. Swartz, a passionate advocate for the freedom of information, helped create Reddit and RSS technology, and was something of an ""Internet folk hero.""  At time of his death, Mr. Swartz was being prosecuted for using M.I.T.'s computers to gain access to millions of scholarly articles from Jstor, a subscription-only service for distributing literary journals. If convicted, Mr. Swartz faced up to 35 years in prison and millions of dollars in fines -- a steep punishment that Mr. Swartz's family and supporters say contributed to his death. ""Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy,"" Mr. Swartz's family and partner said in a statement. ""It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. attorney's office and at M.I.T. contributed to his death."" On Sunday evening, M.I.T.'s president, L. Rafael Reif said that he had appointed an M.I.T. professor to investigate the university's role in Mr. Swartz's case and death. By then, hackers had already begun a campaign that they called #OpAaronSwartz and rendered the M.I.T. site inaccessible using a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack, in which people flood a site with data requests until it collapses from the load. The hackers announced the campaign through a Twitter account associated with Anonymous. TANGO DOWN - mit.edu and doj.gov#Anonymous#OpAaronSwartz Knowledge is not a crime!! Please RT!!! - AnonOps (@anonopsofficial) January 14, 2013 Late Sunday, the site was back online. The Justice Department's Web site, at justice.gov, was operational late Sunday.  Elsewhere on the Web, others paid a more peaceful tribute, setting up a memorial Web site where friends and supporters could post their own remembrances. Academics paid tribute as well, posting links on Twitter to copyright-protected articles with the hashtag #pdftribute. By Sunday evening, a site set up to collect their material included more than 1,500 links to academic and research articles.   "
Daily Report: Hackers in China Attack The Times," For the last four months, Chinese hackers have persistently attacked The New York Times, infiltrating its computer systems and getting passwords for its reporters and other employees, Nicole Perlroth reports in Thursday's New York Times.  After surreptitiously tracking the intruders to study their movements and help erect better defenses to block them, The Times and computer security experts have expelled the attackers and kept them from breaking back in. The timing of the attacks coincided with the reporting for a Times investigation, published online on Oct. 25, that found that the relatives of Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister, had accumulated a fortune worth several billion dollars through business dealings. Security experts hired by The Times to detect and block the computer attacks gathered digital evidence that Chinese hackers, using methods that some consultants have associated with the Chinese military in the past, breached The Times's network. They broke into the e-mail accounts of its Shanghai bureau chief, David Barboza, who wrote the reports on Mr. Wen's relatives, and Jim Yardley, The Times's South Asia bureau chief in India, who previously worked as bureau chief in Beijing. ""Computer security experts found no evidence that sensitive e-mails or files from the reporting of our articles about the Wen family were accessed, downloaded or copied,"" said Jill Abramson, executive editor of The Times. The hackers tried to cloak the source of the attacks on The Times by first penetrating computers at United States universities and routing the attacks through them, said computer security experts at Mandiant, the company hired by The Times. This matches the subterfuge used in many other attacks that Mandiant has tracked to China.  "
Bank of America Suffers Widespread Outages; Hacking Is Not Suspected,"Bank of America customers were unable to access their online banking accounts, mobile payment systems or the company's telephone call centers on Friday. ""We're aware of the issue and are addressing,"" Mark Pipitone, a Bank of America spokesman, said in a statement. ""We're also working closely with our customers to help alleviate any concerns."" A customer service representative said that the bank's online and mobile payment systems had been down since 11 a.m. Eastern time. The customer service telephone lines were also down Friday morning but were restored hours later. The representative described the outage as a ""whole system failure"" and said that even Bank of America employees were not able to see customers' accounts for several hours.  A person close to Bank of America said the problem appeared to stem from an internal breakdown, rather than a cyberattack, but the bank continued to investigate. American banks have been hit by a wave of computer attacks in recent months. Starting last September, intruders have caused intermittent disruptions to the online banking sites of more than a dozen American banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, Capitol One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&T and HSBC. But those earlier attacks caused online banking sites to hiccup or fall offline for several minutes at a time. The outage at Bank of America lasted for several more than four hours. Also, this appeared to be the first outage that affected a bank's telephone lines. Previous outages, representatives for banks have confirmed, were the result of DDoS, or distributed denial of service attacks, so named because attackers deny customer service by directing a large volume of traffic to a site until it falls offline. There were no breaches of bank accounts and no customers' money was taken. Security researchers who have studied those attacks say that the attackers flooded each site with traffic that was more than 10 orders of magnitude larger than the amount of traffic that Russia directed at Estonia in a monthlong online assault in 2007 that nearly crippled the Baltic nation. They were able to do so by infecting data centers and then using multiple data centers to fire unprecedented amounts of traffic at each bank simultaneously until they fell offline. And then firing unprecedented amounts of traffic at each banking site until it fell offline. Affected banks have been working closely with each other and with Internet service providers to conduct forensics on the attacks. Government officials in the United States have accused Iran of orchestrating the attacks in retaliation for American computer attacks against Iran and for Western economic sanctions, but they have offered no proof to back up their claims. A hacker group calling itself Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has claimed responsibility for the attacks in online posts, but deny that they are affiliated with any particular nation state. On Friday, Bank of America customers seemed less concerned with the origin of the outage then when it would be fixed. Several took to online forums and Twitter to vent. ""Bank of America website and app down going on 4 hours now,"" tweeted one customer. Why does this happen so often?"" ""I don't always shutdown worldwide, but when I do... I make sure it's on the 1st of the month when my clients bills are due,"" another tweeted, half-joking.  "
Daily Report: A New Candor In Disclosing Hacking Attacks,"In the last few weeks, a number of American companies have stepped forward to admit they have been the victims of hacking attacks, a departure from how companies used to keep these incidents secret, reports Nicole Perlroth in Thursday's New York Times.Twitter, Facebook and Apple have all announced that they were attacked by sophisticated cybercriminals. The New York Times revealed its experience with hackers in a front-page article last month. The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post have also said they were attacked by what they believed to be Chinese hackers.  The revelations come as computer security experts estimate that more than a thousand companies have been attacked recently. In 2011, security researchers at McAfee unearthed a vast massive online espionage campaign, Operation Shady Rat, that found that more than 70 organizations had been hit over a five-year period, many in the United States. Yet few admit to it. A majority of companies that have at one time or another been the subject of news reports of online attacks refuse to confirm them. The list includes the International Olympic Committee, Exxon Mobil, Baker Hughes, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Chesapeake Energy, the British energy giant BG Group, the steel maker ArcelorMittal and Coca-Cola. What makes some companies admit to a hacking incident? Some step forward in the interest of increasing awareness and improving security within their respective industries. But often their candor is to little avail anyway. "
Hacked A.P. Twitter Feed Sends Erroneous Message About Explosions at White House,"The Twitter account of The Associated Press was hacked on Tuesday and erroneously sent out a message saying there had been explosions at the White House, injuring President Obama. Within a few minutes, Twitter suspended the account, and Julie Pace, the chief White House correspondent for The A.P., announced at a White House briefing that the account had been hacked. Jay Carney, Mr. Obama's press secretary, confirmed that the president was unharmed.   Editors at The A.P. soon followed with a statement saying that ""The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false. We will advise more as soon as possible."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 150 points when the news broke on Twitter - an indicator of traders' presence on the social media platform - before immediately recouping the losses after it became clear that there had been no attack at the White House.  The A.P. typically uses Social Flow, a social media tool, to distribute Twitter posts. But in this case, the attackers posted directly from the Web, according to the meta data associated with the message.  Paul Colford, a spokesman for The A.P. said the Twitter hacking was preceded by an attempt to access The A.P.'s corporate e-mail network, which was likely an effort to get user credentials. ""The attack was blocked, and there is no evidence any A.P. systems beyond e-mail were compromised.""  Through a Twitter account, a group called the Syrian Electronic Army took credit for the attack.  Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama http://t.co/HTKoO6gIL6 - SyrianElectronicArmy (@Official_SEA6)23 Apr 13 That Twitter account is linked to the Web site Syrianelectronicarmy.com, a Syrian-language Web site that broadcasts what the group says are its latest cyberattacks. Even as the Twitter accounts for @AP and @AP_Mobile were suspended Tuesday afternoon, the account for the Syrian Electronic Army was still live. It was the third high-profile corporate account to be hacked in recent months. In February, Burger King's Twitter account was hacked, the company's logo was replaced by a McDonald's logo and rogue announcements began to appear. A day later the Twitter account for Jeep was also attacked. But the attack on The A.P.'s Twitter account was more serious. Within seconds, the erroneous A.P. headline about explosions at the White House had spread all over Twitter and been re-posted hundreds of times. The attack, and hacking episodes before it, continue to raise questions about the security of social media passwords and the ease that brand-name accounts can be accessed. Logging on to Twitter is the same for a company as it is for a consumer, requiring just a user name and one password. Twitter has tried to take an active role in ridding malicious content. It has manual and automatic controls in place to identify such posts and fake accounts, and last year the company sued those responsible for five of the top spamming tools on the site. But preventing hacking and identifying fake accounts continues to be more art than science. Security researchers estimate that as many as 20 million Twitter accounts on the platform are fake, and real accounts continue to be catnip for hackers. An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed a statement about a phishing attempt on The A.P.'s corporate e-mail system to a spokeswoman for the news organization. That person, an employee of The A.P., was not authorized to speak for the organization.  "
Investigations Expand in Hacking of A.P. Twitter Feed,"Three federal agencies are now investigating an incident Tuesday in which hackers hijacked the Twitter account for The Associated Press and momentarily erased $136 billion from the stock market after they posted a fake Tweet reporting that there had been explosions at the White House that injured President Obama. A group calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter, but the Federal Bureau of Investigation is  investigating who was behind the attack, and the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are investigating the impact of the attacks on the market.  ""We have standard operating procedures whenever there are market developments, and this is no exception,"" said John Nester, an S.E.C. spokesman. ""These procedures start with getting the facts about what occurred. We do not limit ourselves to looking at the catalyst for an event, but also its repercussions, to determine whether any further inquiries or actions are warranted."" The A.P.'s account was the fourth prominent Twitter account of a media organization to be hacked in recent months -  accounts for CBS, NPR and the BBC have all been hijacked by hackers recently - but the A.P. incident had the most serious impact. Within seconds of the fake A.P. post, the Dow Jones Industrial Average nosedived, dropping 150 points, before recovering five minutes later. High-frequency trading algorithms that are designed to make trades based on certain headlines served as a catalyst. The C.F.T.C. is now investigating trading in 28 futures contracts that took place over that five-minute period, according to CNBC. A C.F.T.C. spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment but John Chilton, an commissioner with the agency, told CNBC Wednesday that ""We need certain rules of the road for technology and that's particularly true with the advent of social media."" Mr. Chilton, who referred to high frequency traders as ""cheetahs,"" noted that there was no ""kill switch"" in their technology to prevent them from acting on misinformation. ""We need to set up basic rules of the road,"" Mr. Chilton said. ""We should not just accept technology blindly."" The timing of the A.P.  on Twitter comes just two weeks after Bloomberg announced that it would start incorporating Twitter feeds into its financial information terminals. The new feature allows traders to monitor social media buzz and market-moving news from their Bloomberg terminals. Ironically, Bloomberg introduced the service, in part, to prevent the spread of misinformation on Twitter after an erroneous tweet suggested that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was dead last August, creating a surge in crude oil prices. The incident Tuesday also raised questions about security on Twitter. Logging on to Twitter requires the same process for a company as for a consumer - just one user name and one password - and security experts say Twitter could do more. Until now, Twitter has resisted incorporating two-factor authentication, a verification approach that can, for example, send a second, one-time password via text message to users' mobile phones to keep attackers from hijacking their accounts with a single, stolen password. Microsoft rolled out two-factor authentication last week. Apple added it in March. Both Google and Facebook have offered the service for years. ""It's a very established baseline,"" Mark Risher, co-founder of Impermium, an Internet security start-up that aims to help social networks, said Tuesday. ""But there are costs, and user friction is introduced. You could put four deadbolts on your front door, but it's going to be a pain every time you go to the drugstore. That said, why not offer it? I don't have a good answer for that.""  "
No Joke: Syrians Hack The Onion,"On Monday, The Onion, a news parody site, became the latest publication to have its Twitter account hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army. The group, which supports Syria's embattled president, Bashar Al-Assad, posted several anti-Israel messages to The Onion's nearly 5 million Twitter followers. Another message read, ""UN retracts report of Syrian chemical weapon use: Lab tests confirm it is Jihadi body odor."" A member of the Syrian Electronic Army who goes by the hacker handle ""Th3 Pr0"" told The New York Times that the group aimed at The Onion because of a recent Onion parody post, purportedly written by Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, titled: ""Hi, In The Past 2 Years, You Have Allowed Me To Kill 70,000 People.""  ""The Onion is a satire news organization and quite often is more trusted to reflect the news than the corporate media is known to,"" Th3 Pr0 wrote in an e-mail. ""Recently they have published an article that savages Syria and its current circumstances. This hurt the feelings of many Syrians who relied on it to tell the truth in a funny way. We hoped that our effort to correct their news would draw attention to the fact that it was likely that an outside decision was involved in changing The Onion's tune."" ""We hope people take it in good humor and understand our people's suffering,"" he added. ""The Onion can do a much better job reporting the truth through its satire. Unfortunately even they seem to be biased."" The Syrian Electronic Army started targeting Syrian opposition groups during the beginning of the Syrian uprisings in 2011 and have since turned their attention to media outlets, hacking their Twitter accounts in retaliation for what they call the media's one-sided coverage of the Syrian civil war. In recent weeks, Human Rights Watch, NPR, CBS, the Associated Press, E! Online and the Guardian were all hacked by the group.  The group uses multiple tactics in its attacks, but according to security researchers who have investigated the break-ins, the hackers send employees at each organization an e-mail with a link that redirects them to a fake Gmail or Microsoft Outlook log-in page, where they are asked to enter in their username and password. The hackers then use those passwords, to break into e-mail in-boxes, where they can search for the password to a Twitter account or reset the site's Twitter password themselves. In the case of the Associated Press, the hackers sent a link disguised as a Washington Post article. S.E.A. hackers claim that more than 50 A.P. employees fell for the hoax, including several of the A.P.'s social media editors.  To prove that the S.E.A. was behind the recent Associated Press Twitter hack, Th3 Pr0 sent a screenshot he took while he was resetting the AP's Twitter password. Security researchers confirmed that the group was responsible. The S.E.A.'s A.P. attack, in which it used the A.P. account to post a fake message about explosions at the White House, sent the stock market nose-diving before the hoax was discovered.  The group is now emboldened by that success. ""We have a strategy and we are working on it very successfully,"" Th3 Pr0 wrote via e-mail. ""It's just the beginning."" Meanwhile, The Onion deleted the fake posts to its Twitter account and posted a  titled: ""Onion Twitter Password Changed To OnionMan77: 'That Ought To Do It,' Company Sources Confirm.""  "
"Syria, and Its Hacker Activists, Are Back on the Internet","Syrian Internet and cellphone access resumed Wednesday morning after an Internet failure pulled the company offline Tuesday. The likely culprit, technologists say, was the Syrian government. But the Syrian government said the failure was because of a technical problem.  Bakr Bakr, the director general of Syria's General Establishment for Communications, told the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, or SANA, that the Internet failure was caused by a ""malfunction in an optic cable,"" but security experts said that such an occurrence would be unlikely. There are four physical cables that connect Syria to the Internet, three run undersea and one runs over land through Turkey. The only way an outsider could pull off such an outage, security experts say, would be too physically cut all four cables simultaneously. Evidence suggested that the state-run Syrian Telecommunications Establishment, the exclusive provider of Internet access in Syria, simultaneously withdrew the Border Gateway Protocol, or B.G.P., routes into Syria at roughly 7:45 p.m. E.D.T. on Tuesday, ensuring that any information trying to reach Syria could not find its way, according to Renesys, OpenDNS and Arbor Networks. The same technique was used to shut down the Internet and mobile phone service last November. Syrian government officials said terrorists, not the government, were responsible for that failure, but evidence also pointed to government involvement. ""The way the routes were withdrawn was systematic and looked as if individual providers were cut off one after another,"" said Matthew Prince, the founder of Cloudflare, a San Francisco start-up that distributes large volumes of traffic across the Internet. Cloudflare discovered Wednesday morning that one small pocket of the Syrian Internet maintained access to the Internet through the failure, though it was not immediately clear who was using it. That, Mr. Prince said, further contradicted claims that a technical malfunction was to blame. ""That again is a strong indication that this was an explicit effort to turn off most (although not all) of the country's Internet connectivity,"" Mr. Prince said in an e-mail. ""Had it been a true cable cut across all four of the country's connections than this selective space wouldn't have remained online."" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an antigovernment activist group, said it believed ""the reason for the blackout was military operations being carried out by the regime forces in some areas."" The failure had the least effect on rebel-controlled territories, where the Syrian opposition has successfully built an alternate system of Internet and cellphone connectivity using two-way satellite devices. But the failure did temporarily silence the usually boisterous Syrian Electronic Army, the collective of pro-government Syrian hackers who have been breaking into the Twitter accounts of an array of news outlets and nonprofits, including E! Online,""The Onion,"" Human Rights Watch and the Associated Press in recent weeks. On Wednesday morning, one hacker affiliated with Syrian Electronic Army, who identified himself only by his hacker handle,Th3 Pr0, said he did not believe the government was to blame for the failure and that the electronic army's campaign of targeting media outlets would continue.

"In Malaysia's Election, a Free Press Was Elusive","HONG KONG - American presidents have built-in advantages when running for re-election. Corporations and other interest groups tend to give financially to their cause to stay in the good graces of the leadership. The president enjoys the bully pulpit that comes with being in the White House. Throw a healthy economy into the mix, and it's an almost unbeatable combination. Some of the same could be said halfway around the world in Malaysia, except the leadership there enjoys even more pronounced advantages that helped propel it to victory Sunday: control over an economy that is riding a wave of economic prosperity with a growth rate of over 5 percent last year, the government's perceived influence over some of the most influential media outlets - and a willingness to act against those that don't fall into line.  In the run-up to Sunday's voting, there were numerous allegations that Web sites giving voice to the opposition were the victim of cyberattacks. According to the group Human Rights Watch, one online site that is critical of the government, Malaysiakini, could not be accessed from within Malaysia in the two weeks leading to the elections, or readers experienced significant slowdowns while accessing the site. The group also said that at least three other sites  - Radio Free Malaysia, Radio Free Sarawak and Sarawak Report  - experienced what appeared to have been cyberattacks in which the sites were overwhelmed with traffic, curtailing access for nearly a week before the election. There is no conclusive evidence that the government or its supporters were behind such disruptions, but the timing and targets naturally raise questions. As Human Rights Watch noted, Radio Free Sarawak and the Sarawak Report ""frequently report on government corruption and criticize government policies affecting rural residents."" The group said the government was obligated to prevent such attacks from happening to assure free elections. While Sunday's election kept the governing National Front coalition in power, it was left with a weakened majority in Parliament. Since then, the opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, has said the elections were marred by fraud and that his coalition would challenge the results of some races, my colleague Joe Cochrane reports. But the Malaysian authorities have been cracking down on members of the opposition who are raising such issues. As the Brisbane Times reports, the police this week arrested two bloggers, one of whom tweeted a claim that the police were protecting phantom voters in contested election districts. ""We will continue monitoring social media and we will not rest until those who circulate racial postings online are detained,"" said Syed Ismail, the director of the Commercial Crime Investigation Department. ""Anyone who tries to instill hate and compromise public safety will face the music."" The government has reason to be defensive: the rise of social media in Malaysia was viewed as one of the primary reasons why the National Front and the incumbent prime minister, Najib Razak, have struggled to retain control over the country. The social media have   allowed Malaysians access to news reporting outside government control and influence. On Thursday, Western news outlets highlighted reports about a Wednesday night rally that drew tens of thousands to hear Mr. Anwar, the opposition leader, accuse the Malaysian government of having ""stolen the election."" But on the Web site of the New Straits Times, Malaysia's most influential newspaper and one viewed as regularly toeing the government line, the election stories that were highlighted were ""Accept the People's Verdict, Says Azmin,"" ""White House Congratulates Malaysia on Election"" and ""Call to Accept the Election Outcome.""

Let's Build a More Secure Internet,"Eli Dourado is a research fellow with the technology policy program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. ARLINGTON, Va. -- CAN we ever trust the Internet again? In the wake of the disclosures about the National Security Agency's surveillance programs, considerable attention has been focused on the agency's collaboration with companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google, which according to leaked documents appear to have programmed ''back door'' encryption weaknesses into popular consumer products and services like Hotmail, iPhones and Android phones. But while such vulnerabilities are worrisome, equally important -- and because of their technical nature, far less widely understood -- are the weaknesses that the N.S.A. seems to have built into the very infrastructure of the Internet. The agency's ''upstream collection'' capabilities, programs with names like Fairview and Blarney, monitor Internet traffic as it passes through the guts of the system: the cables and routers and switches.  The concern is that even if consumer software companies like Microsoft and telecommunications companies like AT&T and Verizon stop cooperating with the N.S.A., your online security will remain compromised as long as the agency can still take advantage of weaknesses in the Internet itself. Fortunately, there is something we can do: encourage the development of an ''open hardware'' movement -- an extension of the open-source movement that has led to software products like the Mozilla browser and the Linux operating system. The open-source movement champions an approach to product development in which there is universal access to a blueprint, as well as universal ability to modify and redistribute the blueprint. Wikipedia is perhaps the best-known example of a product inspired by the movement. Open-source advocates typically emphasize two kinds of freedom that their products afford: they are available free of charge, and they can be used and manipulated free of restrictions. But there is a third kind of freedom inherent in open-source systems: the freedom to audit. With open-source software, independent security experts can scrutinize the code for vulnerabilities -- whether accidentally or intentionally introduced. The more auditing by the programming masses, the better the security. As the open-source software advocate Eric S. Raymond has put it, ''given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.'' Perhaps the greatest open-source success story is the Internet itself -- at least its ''soft'' parts. The Internet's communications protocols and the software that implements them are collaboratively engineered by loose networks of programmers working outside the control of any single person, company or government. The Internet Engineering Task Force, which develops core Internet protocols, does not even have formal membership and seeks contributions from developers all over the world. But the problem is that the physical layer of the Internet's infrastructure -- the hardware that transmits, directs and relays traffic online, as well as its closely knit software (or ''firmware'') -- is not open-source. It is made by commercial computing companies like Cisco, Hewlett-Packard and Juniper Networks according to proprietary designs, and then sold to governments, universities, private companies and anyone else who wants to set up a network. There is reason to be skeptical about the security of these networking products. The hardware firms that make them often compete for contracts with the United States military and presumably face considerable pressure to maintain good relations with the government. It stands to reason that such pressure might lead companies to collaborate with the government on surveillance-related requests. Because these hardware designs are closed to public scrutiny, it is relatively easy for surveillance at the Internet's infrastructural level to go undetected. To make the Internet less susceptible to mass surveillance, we need to recreate the physical layer of its infrastructure on the basis of open-source principles. At the moment, the open hardware movement is limited mostly to hobbyists -- engineers who use the Internet to collaboratively build ''open'' devices like the RepRap 3D printer. But the Internet community, through a concerted effort like the one that currently sustains the Internet's software architecture, could also develop open-source, Internet-grade hardware. Governments like Brazil's that have forsworn further involvement with American Internet companies could adopt such nonproprietary equipment designs and have them manufactured locally, free from any N.S.A. interference. The result would be Internet infrastructure, both hardware and software, that was 100 percent open and auditable. But never, of course, 100 percent secure. The N.S.A. could still try to exploit the Internet's open hardware. And of course, open hardware would do little to prevent the government from reading e-mail if it still had the cooperation of companies like Microsoft or Google. Open hardware is not a panacea. Still, open hardware would at a minimum make the N.S.A.'s Internet surveillance efforts more difficult and less effective. And it would increase the difficulty of surveillance not just for the N.S.A. but also for foreign governments that might otherwise piggyback on N.S.A.-introduced security vulnerabilities. A 100 percent open-infrastructure Internet -- a trustworthy Internet -- would be an important step in the empowerment of individuals against their governments the world over. "
Syria Loses Access to the Internet,"Syria's access to the Internet was cut on Tuesday. The most likely culprit, security researchers said, was the Syrian government. Syrian Internet traffic came to a  halt just before 3 p.m. Eastern time. Google reported a drop in Internet traffic around that time, as did the Local Coordinating Committees, an antigovernment activist group in Syria.  Four physical cables connect Syria to the Internet - three  under the sea, and the fourth over land through Turkey. For outsiders to cause Tuesday's outage, security experts say, they would have had to physically cut all four cables simultaneously.  That does not appear to have happened in this case, according to security experts. Instead, someone with access to the physical connections dropped the Border Gateway Protocol, or B.G.P., routes into Syria in such a way that any information trying to enter the country was not able to find its way. ""It's akin to someone removing all the street signs into Syria,"" said Matthew Prince, the founder of CloudFlare, an Internet security firm that distributes large volumes of traffic across the Internet. The firm put together a video illustrating Syria's outage. The same technique was used to shut down the Internet and mobile phone service last November. Syrian government officials said terrorists, not the government, were responsible for that outage, but evidence pointed to government involvement. Ironically, Syrian opposition groups are more immune to Internet and cellphone outages than ordinary Syrians. In Syria's opposition-controlled territories, rebels have successfully built an alternate system of Internet and cellphone connectivity using two-way satellite devices. But experts warn that the use of  satellite devices also makes it much easier for the Syrian government to track the rebels' location. ""Radio direction finding and signals intelligence could easily be deployed in this scenario to figure out where the opposition is communicating from,"" said John Scott-Railton, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab, an organization at the University of Toronto that focuses on Internet security.

"U.S. Is a 'Hacker Empire,' Says Chinese Military Analyst","BEIJING - For more than an hour Wednesday morning, a Chinese military analyst excoriated the United States over what state-run media here calls ""Prismgate""  - the revelations of National Security Agency surveillance by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A contractor. Speaking in a Q&A with Xinhua, the state-run news agency, Wang Changqin, whom Xinhua described only as a ""military expert"" but elsewhere is identified as a professor at the Academy of Military Science of the People's Liberation Army of China, called the U.S. a ""hacker empire.""  America stole people's secrets, including economic secrets, he said. ""America has many faces,"" Mr. Wang said, in comments that were often colorful and colloquial, perhaps reflecting the fact they were likely aimed for consumption by millions of ordinary Chinese. It played many roles, including as protector of Internet freedoms and symbol of online morality and security, he said. But, ""as common folk here say, no matter how often you 'play a role,' eventually the stuffing comes out,"" he said. ""Prismgate has shown us America's stuffing."" ""Before, for a variety of reasons, we never had sufficient evidence. But now we have the evidence and everyone knows more than ever: it's not that other people are 'harming' it,"" the U.S., ""but that it is 'harming other people. Especially China,"" said Mr. Wang. He accused U.S. companies of using the fruits of the surveillance to make economic profit, and said, in a speech laced with moral admonition: ""Persisting in evil brings about one's own destruction."" ""This hegemony clearly violates human fairness, justice and the innate sense of right and wrong,"" he said. ""If America doesn't learn lessons from this, stop its hegemonic behavior and truly return to a harmonious way of dealing with the people of the world, get onto the path of cooperation and win-win, in the end it will 'drop a rock on its own feet,'"" he said, using a proverb. ""When you fall on the road of no return that is 'becoming an empire,' you can't get up again."" Mr. Wang said there were about 1,000 military and civilian online hackers mining China's secrets at the N.S.A's secretive eavesdropping organization, the Office of Tailored Access Operations, or TAO. Earlier this month, Foreign Policy magazine reported the office had ""successfully penetrated Chinese computer and telecommunications systems for almost 15 years, generating some of the best and most reliable intelligence information about what is going on inside the People's Republic of China."" Mr. Wang is not a ranking state official, but his workplace - the country's top military academy in Beijing - and the venue of the comments made them noteworthy. A drumbeat of criticism had been growing earlier this year in the U.S. that China was hacking its military and commercial secrets, including this one in the New York Times that cited three authors of a new book, who do research for the U.S. government, saying it amounted to  aimed at leapfrogging development and overtaking the West with legally or illegally procured technology. It was notable that Mr. Wang hit back at the allegations very early in the session, which lasted a little over one hour and was posted live on Xinhua. ""Under the influence of its propaganda, a lot of people believed: China's development wasn't just reliant on 'hard work,' 'resourcefulness' and 'doing one's utmost'"", he said. ""Envious and jealous, they inferred that China must have used many 'crooked roads and paths', the so-called 'original sin' theory."" ""So 'framing' China had the biggest audience. As for the complaints, they used their technology and superior media to cause a bit of noise from time to time: hey my Web site has been attacked, hey that Website has been attacked. Yelling around in that way, yelling that it was a lot, going on a long time, turning up the volume, people who didn't know easily believed it. Not long ago they shouted: the People's Liberation Army hacked us. And that time it wasn't just subordinates who yelled it but the 'big boss,' Obama, who yelled along, even said, this is 'stealing America's property',"" he said. ""This time, everyone understands: in the end they were yelling themselves hoarse to cover their own thievery!"" By tapping in to China's text message networks and the systems backbone at Tsinghua University, one of the country's biggest, as Mr. Snowden alleged in his leaks, ""how much Chinese property did they steal!"" ""America is slipping from being a 'hacker empire' to being a stealing money empire,"" he said. China had to protect itself by strengthening its own online security, he said. Earlier in June, not long after Mr. Snowden's allegations became public, James Mulvenon, a vice president at Defense Group Inc., a technology company in the Washington D.C. area, said U.S. firms did not use information gleaned from surveillance operations against terrorist threats for their commercial advantage, because, among other reasons, and speaking only on a practical level, ""they would not know how to distribute the spoils fairly."" In an email, Mr. Mulvenon said, ""most of the countries we deal with have single, state-affiliated 'national champions' in each sector, so it is easy for their intel services to provide commercial secrets to them."" ""By contrast, the USG faces the prospect of anti-trust lawsuits from the private sector companies that did NOT receive the goods. For example, if the USG stole Huawei's LTE technology, who would they give it to? Cisco? Juniper? Both? What about startups in the 4G sector? Because of this problem, they don't steal commercial secrets for anyone. Of course, the Chinese do not believe us when we tell them this, since the U.S. is the only country in the world with these kind of scruples, but there it is,"" said Mr. Mulvenon.  "
Chinese Firm Increases Stake in Brazilian Tech Company,"The Chinese Internet company Qihoo 360 has significantly increased its bet on a Brazilian cloud-based online security company, PSafe Tecnologia, by leading a $30 million round, the company said Wednesday.  Redpoint Ventures, Redpoint e.ventures and Pinnacle Ventures were all early investors in PSafe and also participated in the new financing round. The new investments, which closed last month, value PSafe at approximately $130 million.  Qihoo 360's stake was not disclosed, but it becomes the largest investor in PSafe, with Redpoint right behind it. It is thought to be one of the largest investments by a Chinese firm in a Brazilian Internet start-up. PSafe, which is part of the Rio de Janeiro-based holding company Grupo Xango, was co-founded by a former Microsoft executive, Marco De Mello. The investment by Qihoo reflects the growing international ambitions of Chinese Internet companies, which are no longer content just to compete in the domestic online business while contending with government censorship and website blocking. A leading Chinese Internet services company, Tencent, introduced its WeChat mobile communications platform, in Brazil in July. Baidu is testing a Portuguese version of its search engine and considering an introduction for next year, according to recent Brazilian news reports. In China, Qihoo has been involved in legal battles with Tencent. It also recently lost out to that company in a contest to forge a partnership with the Chinese search engine firm Sogou. Qihoo started looking at Brazil in 2010, providing a small investment to PSafe when it was founded at the suggestion of Redpoint, which had been an early investor in Qihoo. Qihoo also provided PSafe a license to use its antivirus cloud-scanning technology in Latin America. In 2010, ""we were not very clear about the future of PSafe,"" said Li Tao, Qihoo's vice president of business development and international operations. ""We made that investment as a test."" But now, it sees so much potential that it did not seek out new investors in the latest funding round. ""We decided that it is in Qihoo's best interests to see PSafe fully develop and help it become of the best Internet security companies in Latin America,"" Mr. Li said. Jeff Brody, Redpoint's founding partner, said that Latin America was providing a lot of opportunities for Chines firms as other markets mature. ""For a lot of Chinese companies, the U.S. and Europe are tough,"" he said. ""Brazil and Latin America are pretty attractive and have many parallels.""  Eric Pfanner contributed reporting.   "

Daily Report: Lawsuit Accuses Google of Wiretapping in Gmail Scans,"SAN FRANCISCO - Wiretapping is typically the stuff of spy dramas and shady criminal escapades. But now one of the world's biggest Web companies, Google, must defend itself against accusations that it is illegally wiretapping in the course of its everyday business - gathering data about Internet users and showing them related ads, Claire Cain Miller reports.  The accusations, made over several years in various lawsuits that have been merged into two separate cases, ask whether Google went too far in collecting user data in Gmail and Street View, its mapping project. Two federal judges have ruled, over Google's protests, that both cases can move forward. The wiretapping rulings are the latest example of judges and regulators prodding Google over privacy violations. The company is on the defensive, struggling to persuade overseers and its users that it protects consumer data, while arguing that the law is stuck in the past and has failed to keep up with new technologies. ""It's been a bad month for Google,"" said Alan Butler, a lawyer at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ""What's at stake is a core digital privacy issue for consumers right now, which is the extent to which their digital communications are protected from use by third parties.""  For the most part, Google has managed to avoid major privacy penalties. The Gmail case could have broad effects, though, because nearly half a billion people worldwide use the service, and because if it is, as expected, certified as a class action, the fines could be enormous. At the same time, the case could have long-term consequences for all e-mail services, including those from Yahoo and Microsoft, and for the issue of how confidential is online data. ""This ruling has the potential to really reshape the entire e-mail industry,"" said Eric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University School of Law.  "
Deciding Who Sees Students' Data,"WHEN Cynthia Stevenson, the superintendent of Jefferson County, Colo., public schools, heard about a data repository called inBloom, she thought it sounded like a technological fix for one of her bigger headaches. Over the years, the Jeffco school system, as it is known, which lies west of Denver, had invested in a couple of dozen student data systems, many of which were incompatible. In fact, there were so many information systems -- for things like contact information, grades and disciplinary data, test scores and curriculum planning for the district's 86,000 students -- that teachers had taken to scribbling the various passwords on sticky notes and posting them, insecurely, around classrooms and teachers' rooms. There must be a more effective way, Dr. Stevenson felt.  InBloom, a nonprofit corporation based in Atlanta, seemed to offer a solution: it could collect information from the district's many databases and store it in the cloud, making access easier, and protect it with high-level encryption. The company has name-brand backing: $100 million in seed money from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation along with the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Beyond storing data, it promised to help personalize learning -- by funneling student data to software dashboards where teachers could track individual students and, with the right software, customize lessons in real time. Also, districts could effortlessly share student records with developers seeking to create educational tools for schools. In other words, for Dr. Stevenson, it represented not just a fix to a narrow technical problem, but also a potentially revolutionary way to help educate students. ''We are joining the new generation of data management,'' Dr. Stevenson said enthusiastically in the March issue of ''Chalk Talk,'' the school district's newsletter for parents. She did not imagine that five months later, she would be sitting in a special school board meeting in the district's headquarters, listening as a series of parents, school board members and privacy lawyers assailed the plan to outsource student data storage to inBloom. What troubled the naysayers at that August session was that the district seemed to be rushing to increase data-sharing before weighing the risks of granting companies access to intimate details about children. They noted that administrators had no policies in place to govern who could see the information, how long it would be kept or whether it would be shared with the colleges to which students applied. ''Students are currently subject to more forms of tracking and monitoring than ever before,'' Khaliah Barnes, a lawyer at the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington who appeared via video conferencing, told the room packed with parents. ''While we understand the value of data for promoting and evaluating personalized learning, there are too few safeguards for the amount of data collected and transmitted from schools to private companies.'' Jefferson County is not the only place where parents have challenged the adoption of inBloom. Parents in Louisiana raised a ruckus after discovering that their children's Social Security numbers had been uploaded to inBloom. In April, Louisiana officials said they would remove all student data from the database. Of the nine states that originally signed up this year to participate, just three -- Colorado, New York and Illinois -- are actively pursuing the service. Still, that accounts for a lot of children. New York State has already uploaded data on 90 percent of 2.7 million public school and charter students -- data stripped of identifiers like students' names -- into inBloom; state education officials plan to upload a complete set soon, including names. But New York parents have no say in the matter, said Leonie Haimson, the executive director of Class Size Matters, a nonprofit group that has been the leading challenger of inBloom. ''We are officially the worst state in the country when it comes to student privacy,'' she said, speaking of New York. Educators are naturally excited about the potential for new tools to improve learning. But the Jeffco controversy is a reminder that it can be easy to leap at new and unproven technologies before considering potential risks. EDUCATION technology software for prekindergarten to 12th grade is an $8 billion market, according to estimates from the Software and Information Industry Association. One major reason is the Common Core State Standards Initiative, a program to standardize English and math curriculums nationally. To prepare for assessment tests for those standards, many districts across the country are investing in software to analyze individual student performance in more detail. Services like inBloom want to speed the introduction and lower the cost of these assessment tools by standardizing data storage and security. The idea is that inBloom's open-source code could spur developers to create apps for all its clients, reducing the need for them to customize software to each school district. In theory, that would make the products cheaper for schools. Recent changes in the regulation of a federal education privacy law have also helped the industry. That law, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, required schools to obtain parental permission before sharing information in their children's educational records. The updated rules permit schools to share student data, without notifying parents, with companies to which they have outsourced core functions like scheduling or data management. InBloom made its debut in February by announcing that nine states, representing more than 11 million students, had agreed to help develop or test the technology. A month later, Bill Gates introduced it as a ''new, exciting thing'' in his keynote speech at SXSWedu education conference in Austin, Tex. InBloom offers its clients a vision of continuously quantified students and seamlessly connected teachers. A video on its Web site presents a model of what this techno-utopia might look like. In one scene, a teacher with a tablet computer crouches next to a second-grader evaluating how many words per minute he can read: 55 words read; 43 correctly. Later, she moves to a student named Tyler and selects an e-book ''for at-risk students'' for his further reading. The video follows Tyler home, where his mother logs into a parent portal for an update on his school status: attendance, 86 percent; performance, 72 percent. She taps a button and sends the e-book to play on the family TV. InBloom doesn't actually provide any of the user-end software -- the student assessment dashboard, the reading analytics app, the parent portal -- shown in the video. Executives at the company see their service as the connective tissue between teachers and these technologies, which would be developed by software vendors. In other words, one inBloom goal is to streamline access to students' data to bolster the market for educational products. ''We are not creating commercial apps. Our role is to sit in the middle, to facilitate that innovation,'' Iwan Streichenberger, the C.E.O. of inBloom, said in a phone interview. ''There are tools that come in, mine and analyze the data and make recommendations.'' Yet, for all of inBloom's neutral-sounding intentions, industry analysts say it has stirred some parents' fears about the potential for mass-scale surveillance of students. Parents like Rachael Stickland, a mother of two Jeffco students, say that schools are amassing increasing amounts of information about K-12 students with little proof that it will foster their critical thinking or improve their graduation rates. ''It's a new experiment in centralizing massive metadata on children to share with vendors,'' she said, ''and then the vendors will profit by marketing their learning products, their apps, their curriculum materials, their video games, back to our kids.'' InBloom seems designed to nudge schools toward maximal data collection. School administrators can choose to fill in more than 400 data fields. Many are facts that schools already collect and share with various software or service companies: grades, attendance records, academic subjects, course levels, disabilities. Administrators can also upload certain details that students or parents may be comfortable sharing with teachers, but not with unknown technology vendors. InBloom's data elements, for instance, include family relationships (''foster parent'' or ''father's significant other'') and reasons for enrollment changes (''withdrawn due to illness'' or ''leaving school as a victim of a serious violent incident''). Ms. Barnes, the privacy lawyer, said she was particularly troubled by the disciplinary details that could be uploaded to inBloom because its system included subjective designations like ''perpetrator,'' ''victim'' and ''principal watch list.'' Students, she said, may grow out of some behaviors or not want them shared with third parties. She also warned educators to be wary of using subjective data points to stratify or channel children. One scene in the inBloom video, for instance, shows a geometry teacher virtually reassigning students' seating assignments based on their ''character strengths'' -- helpfully coded as green, yellow and red. On his tablet, the teacher moves a green-coded female student (''actively participates: 98 percent'') next to a red-and-yellow coded boy (''shows enthusiasm: 67 percent''). Executives at inBloom say their service has been unfairly maligned. It is entirely up to school districts or states to decide which details about students to store in the system and with whom to share them, Sharren Bates, inBloom's chief product officer, said. She said the company does not look at, use, analyze, mine or sell the student data it stores. Ms. Bates, who had flown in from Los Angeles to address the special August session of the Jeffco school board, assured it: ''All of the decisions about what data is stored and what applications are approved and what users can see that data in those applications are all a local customer decision.'' MS. STICKLAND, the Jeffco parent, learned about her school district's partnership with inBloom earlier this year, while perusing an education blog. She was already attuned to data privacy and security issues because she works at a nonprofit energy organization that pays for the electricity and gas of facilities like shelters for battered women. Ms. Stickland's job requires her to comply with strict rules that limit access to data, like addresses and phone numbers, which could make her clients vulnerable to intruders. Reading about inBloom, she wondered whether Jeffco officials had investigated the ramifications of storing and sharing student data with education technology vendors. She also worried that district officials might be unable to evaluate inBloom objectively, given its backing by the Gates Foundation, a major donor to public schools whose grant money Jeffco was hoping to attract. She quickly sought a meeting with Dr. Stevenson, the superintendent. ''I think they were star-struck and didn't do their due diligence,'' Ms. Stickland said. In July, the Gates Foundation awarded Jeffco a $5.2 million grant for teacher development. Lynn Setzer, a school district spokeswoman, said administrators had been completely objective in their evaluation of inBloom. For believers in data-driven education, the idea of collating data from a student's record has the same logic as electronic health records. ''Do you want to take your child to the doctor and have three data points -- height, weight and age -- or do you also want data from a hospital in another state?'' asked Bob Wise, a former governor of West Virginia who is an inBloom director. ''I want the most data points available so my child can have the best diagnosis.'' Consolidating and analyzing data that the district already collects just makes common sense to some educators. David Millard, a Jeffco fifth-grade teacher, goes so far as to extract data by hand from different databases and create his own spreadsheets so he can get a more comprehensive view of his students' progress. He thinks that parents should have access to this data about their children's progress, too. ''We are in critical need of a system that ties together the data that we have,'' Mr. Millard said during the school board meeting. Dr. Stevenson envisions inBloom as a vital part of doing just that. The district plans to invest up to $2 million in a student assessment dashboard being built by LoudCloud Systems, a software developer in Dallas, and she wants inBloom to supply data to that dashboard. ''Think of how useful your car dashboard is,'' Dr. Stevenson said in a recent interview. ''You know if you are going too fast, you know if you are going too slow, you know if your tires are low.'' But inBloom isn't actually necessary for the dashboard to work, said Manoj Kutty, chief executive of LoudCloud. His company's system could pull student information directly from the local data storage system that Jeffco already has. ''We might be perfectly fine working with these school districts directly,'' he said. ''FIFTY percent of this project has good intentions,'' Paula Noonan, a Jeffco school board member, said of the inBloom plan. ''The other 50 percent is totally full of risk that hasn't been examined and weighed.'' Concerns about privacy and liability have forced the district to slow down and really think about the use of inBloom. Jeffco's current service agreement says the data repository doesn't guarantee that its electronic files on students are not susceptible to intrusion or attack. Other districts in Colorado, and in other states, are closely watching Jeffco as they consider participating themselves. Dr. Stevenson, who was initially reluctant to allow parents to opt out of inBloom, fearing it would be too expensive and technologically cumbersome, recently notified them that they would have that option. On the advice of privacy advocates and parents, she has also revised her original plan to upload student disciplinary data to inBloom. ''We are really looking at the classroom data that is fundamental to academic progress,'' she said. ''We can do that without disciplinary data.'' The district expects to decide by January on whether to test the data repository next fall. Dr. Stevenson acknowledges that the district must develop policies to specify which data elements to upload to inBloom and the conditions under which they could be shared with vendors. The district has set up a data management advisory council, which includes some parents who work in data security and compliance. To everyone's frustration, there are no accepted national guidelines to follow because, until now, K-12 school districts have largely managed their own data storage. ''There aren't a lot of organizations that have all of the policies in place,'' Dr. Stevenson said. That means each inBloom client must develop its own policies. In New York State, for example, Thomas L. Rogers, superintendent of Nassau County schools, suggested at a recent public hearing that the state form an oversight board to manage inBloom's practices. ''My concern is that the monopoly inBloom creates sits outside the oversight of a publicly elected body,'' he said. Ms. Bates of inBloom said it was important for school districts to define their own legitimate uses for their students' data and to develop policies to manage them. ''We don't have all the answers, '' she said. Educators, in other words, are on their own. This is the sixth in a series about the business of consumer data.

Researchers Find 25 Countries Using Surveillance Software,"Last May, two security researchers volunteered to look at a few suspicious e-mails sent to some Bahraini activists. Almost one year later, the two have uncovered evidence that some 25 governments, many with questionable records on human rights, may be using off-the-shelf surveillance software to spy on their own citizens. Morgan Marquis-Boire, a security researcher at Citizen Lab, at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, and Bill Marczak, a computer science doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, found that the e-mails contained surveillance software that could grab images off computer screens, record Skype chats, turn on cameras and microphones and log keystrokes. The word ""FinSpy"" appeared in the spyware code. FinSpy is spyware sold by the Gamma Group, a British company that says it sells monitoring software to governments solely for criminal investigations.  Now, one year later, Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak have found evidence that FinSpy is being run off servers in 25 countries, including Ethiopia and Serbia, without oversight. Until Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak stumbled upon FinSpy last May, security researchers had tried, unsuccessfully, for a year to track it down. FinSpy gained notoriety in March 2011 after protesters raided Egypt's state security headquarters and discovered a document that appeared to be a proposal by the Gamma Group to sell FinSpy to the government of President Hosni Mubarak. Martin J. Muench, a Gamma Group managing director, has said his company does not disclose its customers but that Gamma Group sold its technology to governments only to monitor criminals. He said that it was most frequently used ""against pedophiles, terrorists, organized crime, kidnapping and human trafficking."" But evidence suggests the software is being sold to governments where the potential for abuse is high. ""If you look at the list of countries that Gamma is selling to, many do not have a robust rule of law,"" Mr. Marquis-Boire said. ""Rather than catching kidnappers and drug dealers, it looks more likely that it is being used for politically motivated surveillance."" As of last year, Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak, with other researchers at Rapid7, CrowdStrike and others, had found command-and-control servers running the spyware in just over a dozen countries. They have since scanned the entire Internet for FinSpy. The Munk School is publishing their updated findings on Wednesday. The list of countries with servers running FinSpy is now Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Britain, Brunei, Canada, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Qatar, Serbia, Singapore, Turkmenistan, the United Arab Emirates,  the United States and Vietnam. In Ethiopia, FinSpy was disguised in e-mails that were specifically aimed at political dissidents. The e-mails lured targets to click on pictures of members of Ginbot 7, an Ethiopian opposition group. When they clicked on the pictures, FinSpy downloaded to their machines and their computers began communicating with a local server in Ethiopia. ""This continues the theme of FinSpy deployments with strong indications of politically motivated targeting,"" the researchers wrote in their report. A Turkmenistan server running the software belonged to a range of I.P. addresses specifically assigned to the ministry of communications. Turkmenistan is the first clear-cut case of a government running the spyware off its own computer system. Human Rights Watch has called Turkmenistan one of the world's ""most repressive countries"" and warned that dissidents faced ""constant threat of government reprisal."" In Vietnam, the researchers found evidence that FinSpy was running on Android-powered phones. They found one Android phone infected with FinSpy that was sending text messages back to a Vietnamese telephone number. That finding was particularly troubling, researchers say, given recent clampdowns by the nation's government. Last year, Vietnam introduced censorship laws that prohibit bloggers from speaking out against the country's ruling Communist party. According to Human Rights Watch, at least 40 people had since been convicted and sentenced to prison terms. Many are now serving terms ranging from three to 13 years. The sale of surveillance technology is still largely unregulated, but Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak's findings have prompted greater scrutiny. Responding to their findings last fall, Germany's foreign minister Guido Westerwelle called for an Europe-­wide ban on the export of surveillance technology to repressive regimes. And last month, Privacy International and other groups filed complaints with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development against Gamma Group and Trovicor GmbH, a German company that also sells surveillance software. ""I don't think you can put technology back in the bottle,"" said Mr. Marquis-Boire. ""I understand why police would want to use this type of technology, but I'm just not for commercial companies selling them to nondemocratic regimes with questionable human rights records.""  "
Googling You,"The settlement last week between a group of state attorneys general and Google over the company's improper data collection from home wireless networks shows the need to overhaul a 27-year-old federal law that is not up to the task of addressing new forms of privacy invasion.  The case concerns Google Street View, the company's program to take photographs of homes, businesses and streets. The mapping project, which had cars outfitted with cameras and other equipment drive every block of America and many other countries, also captured e-mail messages, passwords and personal documents. The company said it meant only to catalog the location of the wireless networks and it inadvertently collected personal information that it never used. Google agreed to pay $7 million to 38 states and the District of Columbia and to create an Internet campaign to show consumers how they could protect their computers from such intrusions. Google Street View is also the subject to several pending private lawsuits and investigations by other countries. The attorneys general based their suit on states' consumer protection laws. A federal law, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, is also supposed to protect Americans' phone calls and personal messages from being monitored without warrants and subpoenas. But it was written for a different era and offers only partial protection against the kind of surveillance that worries privacy advocates today. For starters, the law provides little or no protection for data about the location of cellphones and other devices that is not considered communications but can be used to identify, connect or place individuals. Some federal officials cited weaknesses in the federal law and decided that they could not bring a case against Google's collection of information about wireless networks. The company's Street View program continues to take pictures, but it no longer collects data about wireless networks. Google has also said that it has privacy safeguards to ensure that the locations of individual wireless users are not disclosed without their consent. Those assurances do not go far enough. Congress needs to explicitly protect such information from prying eyes. There have been efforts to upgrade parts of the federal law, but not all of it. In November, for instance, Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, tried to amend the law to make it harder for the government to obtain private e-mail messages stored on the servers of companies like Google. A bipartisan majority of the Judiciary Committee, which Mr. Leahy heads, approved the change, but the full Senate did not vote on it before the end of its term. Mr. Leahy has said that updating the law is one of his top priorities. A lot has changed since 1986, when very few academics and technology enthusiasts had access to rudimentary e-mail systems and the easiest way to snoop on people was to steal their trash. Some might argue that it is just too hard for the government to monitor invasions of privacy, especially when law enforcement itself collects so much information. And many people willingly share every aspect of their life online. Such arguments, however, ignore recent innovations in encryption technologies and the desire of most Americans to keep their private lives private. Congress needs to improve the law so it can keep up. "
Lawmakers Show Concerns About Google's New Glasses,"Eight members of Congress on Thursday formally demanded that Google address a range of privacy concerns about its new wearable technology device, Google Glass. The letter, addressed to Larry Page, Google's chief executive, outlined eight questions for Google and asked for a response by June 14.  ''We are curious whether this new technology could infringe on the privacy of the average American,'' the letter said. ''Because Google Glass has not yet been released and we are uncertain of Google's plans to incorporate privacy protections into the device, there are still a number of unanswered questions.'' The glasses, which are not yet for sale to the public, connect to the Internet and allow people to do things like take photographs, record and watch video, send text messages, post to social media sites and read text snippets. They have already raised privacy concerns on issues like unwanted recording. The request, from the Bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus, came as Google held its annual I/O developers conference in San Francisco, where it showed off Glass, gave software developers information about how to build apps for the device and introduced seven new apps, including ones from Facebook, Twitter and CNN. The group, for which Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, is a co-chairman, asked questions including how Google would collect and store data from the devices, how it would ensure that it did not unintentionally collect private data, how Google would protect the privacy of people not using Glass when they are with people using it and whether the device would have facial recognition technology. Steve Lee, director of product management for Google Glass, addressed the facial recognition question in a statement. ''We've consistently said that we won't add new face recognition features to our services unless we have strong privacy protections in place,'' he said. Google has faced punishments over privacy violations with past products, including a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over a social networking tool and another one with 38 states over data collection during its Street View mapping project. In a session at the conference, Mr. Lee addressed other concerns in the letter. Google followed all its privacy and data collection policies with Glass, he said, and built social cues into the device to help prevent certain privacy violations. For instance, users have to press a button or speak to Glass to take a photograph or record video, and look directly at whatever they are shooting. Still, one developer said he had already built an app for Glass that enables users to take a photograph with a wink. In a statement, Chris Dale, a Google spokesman, said, ''We are thinking very carefully about how we design Glass because new technology always raises new issues.'' He added that Google was slowly selling early versions of the device, which cost $1,500, to people who sign up for them, ''to ensure that our users become active participants in shaping the future of this technology.''

The Face Scan Arrives,"Ginger McCall, a lawyer and privacy advocate, is the founder of Advocates for Accountable Democracy. WASHINGTON -- THE future of technological surveillance is fast approaching -- and we are doing far too little to prepare ourselves. Last week, thanks in part to documents that I and the Electronic Privacy Information Center obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the American public learned that the Department of Homeland Security is making considerable progress on a computerized tool called the Biometric Optical Surveillance System. The system, if completed, will use video cameras to scan people in public (or will be fed images of people from other sources) and then identify individuals by their faces, presumably by cross-referencing databases of driver's license photos, mug shots or other facial images cataloged by name. While this sort of technology may have benefits for law enforcement (recall that the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings were identified with help from camera footage), it also invites abuse. Imagine how easy it would be, in a society increasingly videotaped and monitored on closed-circuit television, for the authorities to identify antiwar protesters or Tea Party marchers and open dossiers on them, or for officials to track the public movements of ex-lovers or rivals. ''Mission creep'' often turns crime-fighting programs into instruments of abuse.  At the moment, there is little to no regulation or legal oversight of technologies like the Biometric Optical Surveillance System. We need to implement safeguards to protect our civil liberties -- in particular, our expectation of some degree of anonymity in public. The Department of Homeland Security is not the only agency developing facial-surveillance capacities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has spent more than $1 billion on its Next Generation Identification program, which includes facial-recognition technology. This technology is expected to be deployed as early as next year and to contain at least 12 million searchable photos. The bureau has partnerships with at least seven states that give the agency access to facial-recognition-enabled databases of driver's license photos. State agencies are also participating in this technological revolution, though not yet using video cameras. On Monday, Ohio's attorney general, Mike DeWine, confirmed reports that law enforcement officers in his state, without public notice, had deployed facial-recognition software on its driver's license photo database, ostensibly to identify criminal suspects. A total of 37 states have enabled facial-recognition software to search driver's license photos, and only 11 have protections in place to limit access to such technologies by the authorities. Defenders of this technology will say that no one has a legitimate expectation of privacy in public. But as surveillance technology improves, the distinction between public spaces and private spaces becomes less meaningful. There is a vast difference between a law enforcement officer's sifting through thousands of hours of video footage in search of a person of interest, and his using software to instantly locate that person anywhere, at any time. A person in public may have no reasonable expectation of privacy at any given moment, but he certainly has a reasonable expectation that the totality of his movements will not be effortlessly tracked and analyzed by law enforcement without probable cause. Such tracking, as the federal appellate judge Douglas H. Ginsburg once ruled, impermissibly ''reveals an intimate picture of the subject's life that he expects no one to have -- short perhaps of his wife.'' Before the advent of these new technologies, time and effort created effective barriers to surveillance abuse. But those barriers are now being removed. They must be rebuilt in the law. Two policies are necessary. First, facial-recognition databases should be populated only with images of known terrorists and convicted felons. Driver's license photos and other images of ''ordinary'' people should never be included in a facial-recognition database without the knowledge and consent of the public. Second, access to databases should be limited and monitored. Officers should be given access only after a court grants a warrant. The access should be tracked and audited. The authorities should have to publicly report what databases are being mined and provide aggregate numbers on how often they are used. We cannot leave it to law enforcement agencies to determine, behind closed doors, how these databases are used. With the right safeguards, facial-recognition technology can be employed effectively without sacrificing essential liberties. "
Google Accused of Wiretapping in Gmail Scans,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Wiretapping is typically the stuff of spy dramas and shady criminal escapades. But now, one of the world's biggest Web companies, Google, must defend itself against accusations that it is illegally wiretapping in the course of its everyday business -- gathering data about Internet users and showing them related ads. The accusations, made over several years in various lawsuits that have been merged into two separate cases, ask whether Google went too far in collecting user data in Gmail and Street View, its mapping project. Two federal judges have ruled, over Google's protests, that both cases can move forward.  The wiretapping rulings are the latest example of judges and regulators prodding Google over privacy violations. The company is on the defensive, struggling to persuade overseers and its users that it protects consumer data, while arguing that the law is stuck in the past and has failed to keep up with new technologies. ''It's been a bad month for Google,'' said Alan Butler, a lawyer at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''What's at stake is a core digital privacy issue for consumers right now, which is the extent to which their digital communications are protected from use by third parties.'' For the most part, Google has managed to avoid major privacy penalties. The Gmail case could have broad effects, though, because nearly half a billion people worldwide use the service, and because if it is, as expected, certified as a class action, the fines could be enormous. At the same time, the case could have long-term consequences for all e-mail services -- including those from Yahoo and Microsoft -- and for the issue of how confidential is online data. ''This ruling has the potential to really reshape the entire e-mail industry,'' said Eric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University School of Law. The Gmail case involves Google's practice of automatically scanning e-mail messages and showing ads based on the contents of the e-mails. The plaintiffs include voluntary Gmail users, people who have to use Gmail as part of an educational institution and non-Gmail users whose messages were received by a Gmail user. They say the scanning of the messages violates state and federal antiwiretapping laws. The case revives a short-lived uproar over Gmail ads when Google introduced them in 2004. Microsoft has recently tried to call attention to the practice as part of its Scroogled campaign, including a video that shows a so-called Gmail man reading people's e-mail. Google has continued to show new types of ads in Gmail, including ads that look like e-mails. ''Google uses Gmail as its own secret data-mining machine, which intercepts, warehouses, and uses, without consent, the private thoughts and ideas of millions of unsuspecting Americans who transmit e-mail messages through Gmail,'' lawyers for the plaintiffs argued on July 11, opposing Google's motion to dismiss the case. On Thursday, Judge Lucy H. Koh of Federal District Court denied Google's motion in a 43-page order that fought the company at almost every turn. Judge Koh is highly respected in Silicon Valley, with a reputation for being fearless. During the Apple-Samsung patent trial, she made headlines for asking an Apple lawyer if he was ''smoking crack.'' In this case, she came down hard on Google. In the June 13 motion to dismiss the suit, Google said the plaintiffs were trying to ''criminalize ordinary business practices.'' It argued that the scanning of Gmail messages was automated, with no human review, and was no different from the processes it uses to detect spam or viruses, offer in-box searching or filter messages into folders. It said users had consented to it by agreeing to Google's terms of service and privacy policy. In a section of the motion that was widely noted, Google also argued that non-Gmail users had no expectation of privacy when corresponding with Gmail users. ''Just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipient's assistant opens the letter, people who use Web-based e-mail today cannot be surprised if their communications are processed by the recipient's'' e-mail provider, the lawyers wrote. Federal wiretap law exempts interception of communication if it is necessary in a service provider's ''ordinary course of business,'' which Google said included scanning e-mail. That argument did not fly with Judge Koh. ''In fact, Google's alleged interception of e-mail content is primarily used to create user profiles and to provide targeted advertising -- neither of which is related to the transmission of e-mails,'' she wrote in last week's ruling. Judge Koh also dismissed Google's argument that Gmail users consented to the interception and that non-Gmail users who communicated with Gmail users also knew that their messages could be read. ''Accepting Google's theory of implied consent -- that by merely sending e-mails to or receiving e-mails from a Gmail user, a non-Gmail user has consented to Google's interception of such e-mails for any purposes -- would eviscerate the rule against interception,'' she wrote. A Google spokeswoman, Leslie Miller, and a lawyer for the company, Michael G. Rhodes of the law firm Cooley, declined to comment on the case beyond a company statement. ''We're disappointed in this decision and are considering our options,'' it said. ''Automated scanning lets us provide Gmail users with security and spam protection, as well as great features like Priority Inbox.'' Lawyers for the plaintiffs, Sean F. Rommel of Wyly Rommel and F. Jerome Tapley of Cory Watson, did not respond to requests for comment. Also last week, Google asked the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to reconsider a Sept. 10 ruling that a separate wiretapping lawsuit could proceed. That one involves Google Street View vehicles that secretly collected personal information from unencrypted home computer networks. The federal antiwiretapping law at the heart of both cases is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, a 1986 law that has been under fire for years for not taking into account modern-day technology like e-mail. ''It's not surprising we're seeing courts struggle with applying the E.C.P.A.,'' Mr. Goldman of Santa Clara said. ''It's a poorly drafted statute that has aged very poorly.'' "
"As It Denounces U.S. Spying, Europe Delays Privacy Protection at Home","BRUSSELS -- Even with Europe in an uproar over intrusive United States surveillance, its leaders are looking for ways to slow down legislation aimed at preventing violations of privacy at home. Two days after Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany telephoned President Obama to complain about the monitoring of her cellphone by the United States, she joined fellow European leaders at a summit meeting in Brussels last week in agreeing not to rush into a new data privacy law, perhaps putting it off until 2015, after elections next May for a new European Parliament. Kicking decisions into the future is a permanent feature of Europe's cumbersome decision-making process. But Germany's acquiescence in a British-led effort to freeze the privacy measures highlighted what appear to be contradictions between the verbal support for privacy among European leaders and their own policy decisions. ''Everyone is very eager to protect privacy in their public statements,'' said Miriam Artino, a policy analyst at La Quadrature du Net, a French organization that promotes digital rights and liberties. ''But we can see that government leaders are not very enthusiastic and are looking for ways to delay the process.''  The disclosures of the National Security Agency's activities by a former contractor for the it, Edward J. Snowden, have set off a fierce debate on both sides of the Atlantic about the proper balance between privacy and economic, security and other interests. In an effort to control the damage, the Obama administration indicated on Monday that it was preparing to ban surveillance of friendly foreign leaders. Ms. Merkel stayed silent about the shift, but officials in Berlin welcomed what apparently was a realization that American economic interests, too, could be harmed if the monitoring persisted. ''The Americans know by now that this affair is very damaging to their own interests, which is evident in the reaction of the president, as well as the Senate,'' the interior minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich, told Germany's N-TV news channel. But increasingly, it has damaged the standing of European politicians as well, as they seek to play down the role their own security services have played in secret surveillance. Britain's intelligence service is long known to have cooperated closely with the N.S.A., carrying out surveillance on behalf of the United States. The director of the N.S.A., Gen. Keith B. Alexander, testified on Tuesday before Congress that reports that his agency had collected the phone records of millions of Europeans were ''completely false.'' Apparently referring to recent reports of extensive phone surveillance in France and Spain by the N.S.A., he said European intelligence services had themselves collected phone records in war zones and other areas outside their borders and shared them with the United States. Europe's involvement in the spying game was given further credence by a former foreign minister of Greece, Theodoros Pangalos, who told a Greek radio station that his country's intelligence services had listened in on the phone conversations of American ambassadors to Greece and Turkey in the 1990s, The Associated Press reported. In addition to what seemed to be the leaders' reluctance to rein in too sharply activities countenanced by their own spy agencies, Europe's slow-track approach to tightening the rules on privacy protection has faced a host of other hurdles. The proposed legislation in the European Parliament met with fierce opposition from business groups in the United States and Europe. There were also concerns that the issue would complicate negotiations on a wide-ranging trade agreement between Europe and the United States, a pact that many European leaders champion as an important lever to help lift Europe's sluggish economic growth. Many members of the current Parliament and officials at the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, had wanted to push the law through before next summer. Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German Parliament member who is in the vanguard of that push, said the summit meeting decision showed that Germany, the bloc's weightiest economic and political power, had been eclipsed by other nations in protecting privacy. ''The Germans are not on the forefront when it comes to better privacy protection for its citizens, but the French, Italians and Spanish are,'' said Mr. Albrecht, who spoke by telephone from Washington. Peter Schaar, the German federal data protection commissioner and a longtime critic of relatively lax American data privacy policies, took European leaders to task for delaying the proposed legislation. ''Whoever delays this reform is endangering it in an irresponsible way,'' said Mr. Schaar, appealing ''also to our government'' for deeds, not words. Immediately after last week's meeting in Brussels, Viviane Reding, an outspoken vice president of the European Commission and a proponent of tight privacy rules, insisted that France, Poland and Italy were still pushing for a strong law in 2014. Yet the legislation has been under consideration for two years and, caught by the crosswinds of rival national interests and corporate lobbying, the process has shown how hard it is for Europe to agree on protecting privacy, something nearly everyone supports in principle. The United States has also complicated matters, lobbying hard in Brussels against aspects of the proposed rules that Washington and American businesses do not like. Two years ago, it persuaded the commission to abandon a measure that would have shielded Europeans from requests by American authorities to share online data gathered by some of the biggest American Internet companies, which have many users in Europe. Yet, in a serious reversal for Washington, that measure was restored after a panel of European Union lawmakers early last week backed a stipulation that could require American companies like Google and Yahoo to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. American technology companies worry that fines for breaking those rules and others would run as high as 5 percent of a company's global annual revenue or 100 million euros, about $137 million, whichever is higher. Mr. Albrecht, the German lawmaker who was pushing for tough rules, said one reason Germany joined Britain in seeking to slow down the process was the strong influence of the technology industry. ''Lobbying also, at the level of the heads of state, plays a role,'' Mr. Albrecht said. He referred to news reports that Eric E. Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, had served as an adviser to David Cameron, the British prime minister. One curious aspect of the furor over monitoring of the German chancellor's cellphone is that perhaps no European leader is as conflicted by the pitfalls and possibilities of digital technology as Ms. Merkel. A trained scientist herself, she is keenly aware that Europe trails America in digital technology, and often reminds audiences that there are no Googles, Apples or Facebooks on a troubled Continent that is thus missing out on economic growth. At the same time, she defends Germany's strict data protection laws, which are an outgrowth of the Nazi and Communist past here. Ms. Merkel, raised in East Germany, is deeply familiar with government spying on citizens. Her personal history also means that she always had a vision of the United States as a bastion of civil liberties, and seeing this vision dashed over the past week certainly helped fuel her evident anger with Washington. Her quandary became clear in Brussels last week. On the one hand, with the furor over her cellphone, Ms. Merkel was clearly concerned to fend off strong criticism at home that she had failed to react vigorously to last summer's initial disclosures of extensive American eavesdropping on millions of Germans, and really became engaged only after her personal privacy was at stake. On the other, she and other European leaders faced a decision on data protection rules gathering momentum in the European Parliament. Der Spiegel, a German newsmagazine, reported that Germany had played a critical role in adopting language that essentially postponed a decision on how to deal with United States digital companies that have clear obligations under American law to hand over data if subpoenaed. Ms. Merkel, the newsmagazine said, citing documents from the German Foreign Ministry, sided with Mr. Cameron to delay any regulation until 2015. "
Web Hunt for DNA Sequences Leaves Privacy Compromised,"The genetic data posted online seemed perfectly anonymous -- strings of billions of DNA letters from more than 1,000 people. But all it took was some clever sleuthing on the Web for a genetics researcher to identify five people he randomly selected from the study group. Not only that, he found their entire families, even though the relatives had no part in the study -- identifying nearly 50 people. The researcher did not reveal the names of the people he found, but the exercise, published Thursday in the journal Science, illustrates the difficulty of protecting the privacy of volunteers involved in medical research when the genetic information they provide needs to be public so scientists can use it. Other reports have identified people whose genetic data was online, but none had done so using such limited information: the long strings of DNA letters, an age and, because the study focused on only American subjects, a state.  ""I've been worried about this for a long time,"" said Barbara Koenig, a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco who studies issues involving genetic data. ""We always should be operating on the assumption that this is possible."" The data are from an international study, the 1000 Genomes Project, that is collecting genetic information from people around the world and posting it online so researchers can use it freely. It also includes the ages of participants and the regions where they live. That information, a genealogy Web site and Google searches were sufficient to find complete family trees. While the methods for extracting relevant genetic data from the raw genetic sequence files were specialized enough to be beyond the scope of most laypeople, no one expected it to be so easy to zoom in on individuals. ""We are in what I call an awareness moment,"" said Eric D. Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health. There is no easy answer about what to do to protect the privacy of study subjects. Subjects might be made more aware that they could be identified by their DNA sequences. More data could be locked behind security walls, or severe penalties could be instituted for those who invade the privacy of subjects. ""We don't have any claim to have the answer,"" Dr. Green said. And opinions about just what should be done vary greatly among experts. But after seeing how easy it was to find the individuals and their extended families, the N.I.H. removed people's ages from the public database, making it more difficult to identify them. But Dr. Jeffrey R. Botkin, associate vice president for research integrity at the University of Utah, which collected the genetic information of some research participants whose identities were breached, cautioned about overreacting. Genetic data from hundreds of thousands of people have been freely available online, he said, yet there has not been a single report of someone being illicitly identified. He added that ""it is hard to imagine what would motivate anyone to undertake this sort of privacy attack in the real world."" But he said he had serious concerns about publishing a formula to breach subjects' privacy. By publishing, he said, the investigators ""exacerbate the very risks they are concerned about."" The project was the inspiration of Yaniv Erlich, a human genetics researcher at the Whitehead Institute, which is affiliated with M.I.T. He stresses that he is a strong advocate of data sharing and that he would hate to see genomic data locked up. But when his lab developed a new technique, he realized he had the tools to probe a DNA database. And he could not resist trying. The tool allowed him to quickly find a type of DNA pattern that looks like stutters among billions of chemical letters in human DNA. Those little stutters -- short tandem repeats -- are inherited. Genealogy Web sites use repeats on the Y chromosome, the one unique to men, to identify men by their surnames, an indicator of ancestry. Any man can submit the short tandem repeats on his Y chromosome and find the surname of men with the same DNA pattern. The sites enable men to find their ancestors and relatives. So, Dr. Erlich asked, could he take a man's entire DNA sequence, pick out the short tandem repeats on his Y chromosome, search a genealogy site, discover the man's surname and then fully identify the man? He tested it with the genome of Craig Venter, a DNA sequencing pioneer who posted his own DNA sequence on the Web. He knew Dr. Venter's age and the state where he lives. Bingo: two men popped up in the database. One was Craig Venter.  ""Out of 300 million people in the United States, we got it down to two people,"" Dr. Erlich said. He and his colleagues calculated they would be able to identify, from just their DNA sequences, the last names of approximately 12 percent of middle class and wealthier white men -- the population that tends to submit DNA data to recreational sites like the genealogical ones. Then by combining the men's last names with their ages and the states where they lived, the researchers should be able to narrow their search to just a few likely individuals. Now for the big test. On the Web and publicly available are DNA sequences from subjects in the 1000 Genomes Project. People's ages were included and all the Americans lived in Utah, so the researchers knew their state. Dr. Erlich began with one man from the database. He got the Y chromosome's short tandem repeats and then went to genealogy databases and searched for men with those same repeats. He got surnames of the paternal and maternal grandfather. Then he did a Google search for those people and found an obituary. That gave him the family tree. ""Now I knew the whole family,"" Dr. Erlich said. And it was so simple, so fast. ""I said, 'Come on, that can't be true.'"" So he probed and searched and checked again and again. ""Oh my God, we really did this,"" Dr. Erlich said. ""I had to digest it. We had so much information."" He and his colleagues went on to get detailed family trees for other subjects and then visited Dr. Green and his colleagues at the N.I.H. to tell them what they had done. They were referred to Amy L. McGuire, a lawyer and ethicist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. She, like others, called for more public discussion of the situation. ""To have the illusion you can fully protect privacy or make data anonymous is no longer a sustainable position,"" Dr. McGuire said. When the subjects in the 1000 Genomes Project agreed to participate and provide DNA, they signed a form saying that the researchers could not guarantee their privacy. But, at the time, it seemed like so much boilerplate. The risk, Dr. Green said, seemed ""remote."" ""I don't know that anyone anticipated that someone would go and actually figure out who some of those people were,"" Dr. McGuire said.

Daily Report: Google Hastens to Show Concern for Privacy," Google executives are realizing that penalties for privacy breaches, like those it acknowledged involving its Street View project, do matter, if only because of the reputational risks, David Streitfield and Claire Cain Miller report in Thursday's New York Times.  In the culmination of a two-year investigation into whether its Street View mapping project violated privacy protections, law-enforcement officials told Google this week to shape up. Again. Google has repeatedly redefined how people communicate and acquire knowledge in the 21st century, and it has repeatedly been accused of breaking the rules in the process. The company says it has taken its mistakes in the case to heart and has already changed. Never again, it says, will a midlevel engineer be able to do anything like what one did in Street View: start a program to scoop up data from potentially millions of unencrypted Wi-Fi networks around the world, without his bosses knowing. To make sure of this, a coalition of 38 states has drawn up numerous specific steps for Google to take, ranging from educating its engineers to educating its lawyers. Whatever Google was doing before to improve its privacy controls was not enough, the states say. Google's internal compliance will not be directly monitored. But if states feel Google is not upholding its side of the deal, they can bring the matter up to the executive committee that brokered the deal, including the attorneys general of Illinois, Massachusetts and Texas. Some privacy experts think the program has a fair chance of success. ""This gives me some glimmer of hope that going forward, the culture of Google will include more privacy by design,"" said Joseph L. Hall, senior staff technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. ""Then they could do things in an innovative way on the front end that won't result in needing to beg for forgiveness later."" Still, it is difficult to make changes in an extremely successful technology firm.  "
Google Admits to Privacy Violations in Street-Mapping Project," In ""Google Concedes That Drive-By Prying Violated Privacy,"" David Streitfeld writes about Google's privacy violation and its promise to pay more attention to privacy concerns.   WHAT did Google acknowledge on Tuesday? WHAT is Street View? WHAT are some of the requirements that Google has to fulfill as part of this week's settlement? WHAT kinds of personal information did Google collect during its street-mapping initiative?  HOW many states brought a case against Google? HOW much money does Google have to pay as a fine?  WHO is Scott Cleland? WHO led the states' investigation?  WHY did the Federal Trade Commission fine Google last summer?  WHERE did regulators pursue Google aggressively, but then end their investigation in November without bringing charges?   WHEN did the states' inquiry begin?

Daily Report: Europe's Biggest Privacy Fine Is Pocket Change to Google,"Regulators in Germany, one of the most privacy-sensitive countries in the world, unleashed their wrath on Google on Monday for scooping up sensitive personal information in the Street View mapping project and imposed the largest fine ever assessed by European regulators over a privacy violation, Claire Cain Miller reportsin The New York Times.  The penalty? $189,225. Put another way, that's how much Google made every two minutes last year, or roughly 0.002 percent of its $10.7 billion in net profit. It is the latest example of regulators' meager arsenal of fines and punishments for corporations in the wrong. Academics, activists and even regulators themselves say fines that are pocket change for companies do little to deter them from misbehaving again and are merely baked into the cost of doing business. Johannes Caspar, the data protection supervisor in Hamburg who led the Street View investigation, said the fine, which was close to the maximum of 150,000 euros ($195,000) that he could impose, was woefully inadequate to stop the practices of companies as large as Google. He called on lawmakers to raise such fines significantly.  "
What Is More Important: Our Privacy or National Security?," Earlier this year, Edward J. Snowden, a government contractor, leaked classified documents to the news media that revealed the existence of top-secret government surveillance programs.   We now know that the National Security Agency gathers phone logs and Internet data from millions of Americans as part of its mission to keep the United States safe. But has domestic spying gone too far?   What do you feel is more important: our privacy or national security?   In the article ""Poll Finds Disapproval of Record Collection, but Little Personal Concern,"" Allison Kopicki writes about the results of a June CBS News poll conducted after the first leaks by Mr. Snowden. In the wake of the exposure of two classified surveillance operations, most Americans expressed disapproval about the United States government's collecting phone records of ""ordinary"" Americans. Yet, most showed little concern about their own Internet activities or phone calls' being monitored. A majority, 57 percent, said that the leaks about the surveillance programs would not affect the ability of the United States to prevent future terrorist attacks, while 30 percent said the fact that the programs had been made public would weaken the government's efforts to prevent terrorism. According to a CBS News poll released Tuesday evening, nearly 6 in 10 Americans said they disapproved of the federal government's collecting phone records of ordinary Americans in order to reduce terrorism. However, three-quarters said they approved of the government's tracking phone records of Americans suspected of terrorist activity. Nearly the same number approved of the United States' monitoring the Internet activities of people living in foreign countries.  Students: Tell us ...

Steps to Take In Data Breach,"Half of identity fraud victims in 2012 had also received a data breach notification in the same year, a new report from Javelin Strategy & Research finds. Javelin's 2013 Data Breach Fraud Impact Report finds that data breaches are increasingly correlated with fraud; if your personal information is compromised in a data breach, you are much more likely to end up being a victim, said Al Pascual, a senior security, risk and fraud analyst at Javelin. The fraud in question usually involves using the stolen information to create a new account in your name, or to gain illegal access to an existing account.  Javelin cites information from the Open Security Foundation, a nonprofit that collects information about data breaches, which found that there were 1,611 breaches in 2012, a 48 percent increase over the prior year. And the impact can be significant. In a case study examined in the report, Javelin calculated that a breach of the South Carolina Department of Revenue, which led to the exposure of 3.6 million Social Security numbers and thousands of payment card numbers, cost affected consumers an average of 20 hours and $776 out of pocket to resolve. While there is little consumers can do to prevent data breaches at large companies or government agencies, they can take steps to protect themselves if they get a notification of such a breach. But the statistics suggest that consumers aren't acting when they are informed that their information was compromised, Mr. Pascual said. ''They're getting notifications, but they're not acting on them,'' he said. ''If they were, the numbers would be lower.'' His advice? If you receive a data breach letter, ''Don't just throw it away.'' Rather, he advises, if you receive a notification, there are some steps you should take as a result: -- If you are offered free identity protection services after a breach, use them. The services can help notify you of suspicious activity on your credit report, and offer assistance in resolving any fraud that occurs. -- Contact your bank or credit card company and ask about any potential effect the breach could have on your accounts. -- If your Social Security number is lost or stolen in a breach, placing a fraud alert on your credit report can flag lenders that any application for credit should be given greater scrutiny. A security freeze is a stronger option, as it will prevent any lender from accessing your credit file. But be aware that you will need to remember to lift the freeze temporarily, if you need to seek credit, apply for a job or rent an apartment. -- Monitor your financial accounts by signing up for e-mail or text alerts, which can notify you quickly of any unusual activity, such as an unauthorized funds transfer or a change of address. (According to Javelin, changing the physical address of a bank account occurred in more than half of account takeover frauds, in which a criminal illegally gains access to your bank account). Have you been notified of a data breach? What steps did you take to protect yourself? This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Protecting Your Children's Credit,"If you want to make sure your personal information isn't at risk from identity thieves, you can ask to have a security freeze placed on your credit file at the three major credit bureaus -- Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. That prevents lenders or credit card companies (that you aren't already doing business with) from gaining access to the information and in effect shuts down the chance of unauthorized credit being issued. Typically, parents have not been able to exercise the freeze option for their children -- because they usually don't have credit in the first place. But now, several states have passed laws giving parents the right to request similar protections for minors. In effect, parents can ask to have a credit record created, and then have it frozen.  Why would you want to do that? Children's personal information, like their Social Security number, is valued by identity thieves because there typically isn't a credit file associated with the data. That means they can pair the information with any name and date of birth and create a false identity -- with clean credit. Thieves can open credit cards and borrow money, and the damage isn't discovered for years -- because parents typically don't check a child's credit report. ''It's a persistent problem,'' although it is hard assess its magnitude, said Steven Toporoff, a lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission. That's because parents are often unaware anything has happened until the child becomes a young adult and applies for a car loan or a student loan and is rejected. But in 2012, he said, 8 percent of 280,000 identity theft complaints received by the F.T.C. concerned child victims. Children's information can be at risk at schools and medical offices but also from family members who may be in financial straits and have ruined their own credit. ''A lot of the time, it's extended family members who obtain the information and use it, knowing a child's credit record is pristine, and that usually nobody is checking it,'' said Diane Childs, financial information and identity theft outreach coordinator for the Oregon Division of Finance and Corporate Securities. As of Sept. 13, residents of Oregon can contact the three major credit bureaus and ask that they create a ''protected'' record in their child's name -- a sort of empty credit file -- which is then frozen. The enactment of the law was prompted by a data breach in a state school district. Maryland and Delaware have similar laws. Child identity protection laws take effect next year in Texas and Ilinois, and measures are also under consideration in other states, including Wisconsin and Florida. Utah created a somewhat different program in consultation with TransUnion, which lets parents register their children's information in the credit bureau's ''high risk'' database. TransUnion searches its files for records with the child's information and notifies the parents if anything is found, said Scott Morrill, program manager for the Child Identity Protection Program at the Utah attorney general's office. And any company seeking to issue credit based on the information gets a warning that the application is likely to be fraudulent. When the child turns 17, the information is automatically removed from the system, he said. The program isn't foolproof, he conceded, since the two other major credit bureaus don't participate. Eva Velasquez, chief executive of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said the state laws were a step in the right direction, but she tends to prefer Utah's approach because it doesn't require formal establishment of a record for a minor. Once a file is established, it could be subject to errors, she said, and once the file is frozen, consumers generally have to remember to unfreeze it when the child is ready to apply for credit. She advises creating a file to freeze only if you suspect there is a problem. ''Without a red flag,'' she said, ''it's best not to muddy the water.'' Here are some questions to consider: â-  When should I suspect that my child may be the victim of identity theft? You should be suspicious if your child begins to receive unusual mail, like collection notices or bills in your child's name. â-  Is there any legitimate reason for a child to have a credit file? Yes, said Maxine Sweet, vice president for public education at Experian. For instance, parents may add an older child to their credit-card account as a joint holder, if the card company allows it, or as an ''authorized user,'' to help the child learn how to manage credit. Experian, however, doesn't make the file accessible for credit inquiries until the child turns 18: ''If Experian has a file on a minor child, we protect those minors in every state in that we do not disclose the information to a third party,'' she said. â-  Is there a charge for enacting a security freeze? The service is typically free to fraud victims, but the credit bureaus may charge a fee for enacting a freeze proactively; fees vary by state. Under Oregon's law for minors, for instance, there is no charge to create the child's record, but each credit bureau charges $10 to freeze the record. Enrolling in Utah's program is free. "
ID Theft Services Toning Down Some Claims,"Commercial identity-theft protection services are doing somewhat better at toning down their claims and providing more specifics about the assistance they provide, a report from the Consumer Federation of America says. Last year, the federation rated variousidentity-protection services based on the clarity of their marketing, and whether or not they were promising more than they delivered. The federation, working with many of the sites themselves, has created a set of voluntary ""best practices"" for them to follow. The guidelines are meant to help deter potentially misleading claims and ensure that consumers understand just what they are getting, and how much the services cost, before they sign up. Susan Grant, the federation's director of consumer protection, said the goal of its work with the service providers is to help consumers understand what they are getting, because the services offered by the firms vary. Some, for instance, simply monitor a participant's credit file for suspicious activity and send e-mail alerts to subscribers, while others offer Internet scanning, which aims to ferret out credit card numbers or other information that may be offered for sale on illegal Web sites. Still others may offer checks of public records, such  bankruptcy filings, to see if stolen personal information is being used to create a new identity.  Some sites essentially offer advice about what to do, after the fact - which may be helpful, she said, but is different from actively preventing identity fraud. ""For some people, someone who will hold your hand through the process may be really what they need,"" she said. But it is important for consumers to know that advice is what they are buying, she said. A recent review of 20 Web sites - some of which participated in the federation's working group, and some that didn't - found that many have made ""significant improvements"" or are in the process of implementing the federation's recommendations, said Ms. Grant. For instance: - The federation found that AllClear ID (formerly called Debix) modified its claim of a ""100% success rate,"" to state that it referred to resolving cases of financial identity fraud, specifically. (Ms. Grant noted that because there are other types of identity theft, including medical identity theft, the federation considered the claim to be too broad). AllClear ID also added information under its ""frequently asked questions"" about its refund policy, and a link to a summary of the benefits of its insurance policy, the federation found. - Equifax, which was not a member of the federation's working group, added a link from its products page to a summary of the benefits provided by its identity-theft insurance, and also provides a clearer explanation of the fraud assistance that it offers to customers if they become identity-theft victims, the federation said. - Identity Guard, offered by Intersections Inc., has added an explanation to make clear that the credit score it provides as part of its service is for educational purposes, and isn't the score that lenders actually use. Some services, however, don't seem to be in a big hurry to change their approach. Experian, the federation said, will make changes to its Web site ""over the next twelve months,"" including the removal of a claim to ""Stop Identity Theft in its Tracks."" (In its 2012 report, the federation said the statement was an ""overpromise"" of what the service could do.) The federation is in ongoing talks with TransUnion about making changes to its Zendough site, the federation said. (In its 2012 report, the federation had recommended changes like putting more information in easy-to-find locations, rather than in a jargon-filled ""product agreement."") One site, EZShield, didn't respond when the federation tried to contact it, the report said. The federation offers tips on shopping for identity theft services on its identitytheft.org site, and additional information is available from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouseas well as the Federal Trade Commission.

Student Data's Future,"To the Editor: New platforms for collecting, storing and displaying data about students can help educators make instructional decisions (''Deciding Who Sees Students' Data,'' Oct. 5). But first we must have safeguards to protect students' privacy and teacher-student interactions. Educators can lead the way by fostering discussion on these questions:  How secure is confidentiality when students' names are coded to protect their identities? Who owns and controls access to student data? How do students and parents consent to the data collected about students? Are they informed about all the various possible uses for that data, and about security procedures? More data can help educators improve learning, but at what cost to the personal aspect of interaction with students? Will the premium placed on what's measurable depreciate teachers' perception and judgment? Will recorded early missteps limit students' ability to get a fresh start as they move on? SUSAN H. FUHRMAN Manhattan, Oct. 7 The writer is the president of the National Academy of Education and of Teachers College, Columbia University. To the Editor: I agree with the suggestion of the Nassau County school superintendent, Thomas L. Rogers, that New York State form an oversight board to manage practices of its outside data collection. More generally, individual states nationwide must exert more oversight over the collection, use and storage of students' information. This role would best be served by a state education chief privacy officer who would be appointed by a state's governor and be the primary gatekeeper and expert on student privacy and security matters. This C.P.O. would advise students and parents on how they can protect their personally identifiable information; make recommendations on privacy and security to the governor, state legislatures and agencies, and schools; and oversee and audit the privacy and security activities of organizations using student data. Students deserve a strong advocate for their privacy rights amid data-driven education reform initiatives. State C.P.O.'s would be a major step toward protecting the rights of students and preventing data leaks and breaches that may jeopardize their futures and safety. SHEILA KAPLAN Brooklyn, Oct. 7 "
Getting a Glimpse of Your Own Marketing Data Online," Updated with analysts' comments  Last weekend, I wrotea story about Acxiom, a marketing technology firm that introduced a Web site on Wednesday morning called Aboutthedata.com. The site allows consumers to view all sorts of personal details the company has collected about them in its marketing databases. The piece provoked an animated conversation across social media:  Find out what #data brokers know about you on Sept 4. At least theoretically. I don't expect it to be comprehensive. http://t.co/dVbzS9kKM5 - Carri Bugbee (@CarriBugbee)2 Sep 13 Tomorrow, you can find out how you've been sold http://t.co/xIM4tgP0yS #prospectresearch #nptech - Raymund Flandez (@raymundf23)3 Sep 13 On the Web site, people who are willing to undergo an identity verification process - which includes submitting your name, address and the last four digits of your Social Security number - and who pass that test will be able to see, correct and delete information Acxiom has collected about them. But some privacy and security analysts said they were uncomfortable with an identity verification system that requires consumers to give personal details like their birth dates and partial Social Security numbers in order to access their marketing records. Ashkan Soltani, an independent privacy and security consultant who visited the site Wednesday morning, told me he was reluctant to give Acxiom ""even more info about me - specially high-quality info that I volunteer.""  He was more blunt on Twitter: Acxiom's NEW portal seems more like a clever data-harvesting scam. Requires name/addr/email/dob to gain access https://t.co/kr4W6UrJoM (1/2) - ashkan soltani (@ashk4n)4 Sep 13 Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, also warned about potential security flaws. After all, he said, family members like ex-spouses - as well as employees of banks and credit card companies - may have access to the same personal identity details about consumers and could use that information to impersonate them on the site. ""The data verification system does not inspire confidence,"" Mr. Soghoian said. For those who are willing to log in, they will find six categories of information on the site that could include personal details like race, gender and occupation; residential data like assessed home data and lot square footage; vehicle data like the make and model of your car; economic data like estimated household income; shopping data like whether your household buys books, cooking utensils or toys; and household interests like board games, golf, hunting or text-messaging. When I visited Acxiom's headquarters in Little Rock, Ark., last week to get a preview of Aboutthedata.com, I discovered that I was unable to view my own marketing profile. It turned out that, after I started writing about Acxiom last year, including a piece about the troubles I had getting access to my Acxiom record, the company had opted me out of its marketing databases. So, after I passed the identification process on the new site, I found there were no details to see about me - only a message saying there was no information available. We would love to hear from readers who are able to view their details on Aboutthedata.com. What's your reaction to the site? How did you find the identity verification process - was it secure enough for you? How accurate were the data about you and your household? How did the site make you feel about data mining for the purposes of marketing? Did you modify or delete your data, did you opt out or stay in? Why?  "
"Internet Activist, a Creator of RSS, Is Dead at 26, Apparently a Suicide","Aaron Swartz, a wizardly programmer who as a teenager helped develop code that delivered ever-changing Web content to users and who later became a steadfast crusader to make that information freely available, was found dead on Friday in his New York apartment. An uncle, Michael Wolf, said that Mr. Swartz, 26, had apparently hanged himself, and that a friend of Mr. Swartz's had discovered the body. At 14, Mr. Swartz helped create RSS, the nearly ubiquitous tool that allows users to subscribe to online information. He later became an Internet folk hero, pushing to make many Web files free and open to the public. But in July 2011, he was indicted on federal charges of gaining illegal access to JSTOR, a subscription-only service for distributing scientific and literary journals, and downloading 4.8 million articles and documents, nearly the entire library. Charges in the case, including wire fraud and computer fraud, were pending at the time of Mr. Swartz's death, carrying potential penalties of up to 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines.  ''Aaron built surprising new things that changed the flow of information around the world,'' said Susan Crawford, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York who served in the Obama administration as a technology adviser. She called Mr. Swartz ''a complicated prodigy'' and said ''graybeards approached him with awe.'' Mr. Wolf said he would remember his nephew, who had written in the past about battling depression and suicidal thoughts, as a young man who ''looked at the world, and had a certain logic in his brain, and the world didn't necessarily fit in with that logic, and that was sometimes difficult.'' The Tech, a newspaper of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reported Mr. Swartz's death early Saturday. Mr. Swartz led an often itinerant life that included dropping out of Stanford, forming companies and organizations, and becoming a fellow at Harvard University's Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. He formed a company that merged with Reddit, the popular news and information site. He also co-founded Demand Progress, a group that promotes online campaigns on social justice issues -- including a successful effort, with other groups, to oppose a Hollywood-backed Internet piracy bill. But he also found trouble when he took part in efforts to release information to the public that he felt should be freely available. In 2008, he took on PACER, or Public Access to Court Electronic Records, the repository for federal judicial documents. The database charges 10 cents a page for documents; activists like Carl Malamud, the founder of public.resource.org, have long argued that such documents should be free because they are produced at public expense. Joining Mr. Malamud's efforts to make the documents public by posting legally obtained files to the Internet for free access, Mr. Swartz wrote an elegant little program to download 20 million pages of documents from free library accounts, or roughly 20 percent of the enormous database. The government shut down the free library program, and Mr. Malamud feared that legal trouble might follow even though he felt they had violated no laws. As he recalled in a newspaper account, ''I immediately saw the potential for overreaction by the courts.'' He recalled telling Mr. Swartz: ''You need to talk to a lawyer. I need to talk to a lawyer.'' Mr. Swartz recalled in a 2009 interview, ''I had this vision of the feds crashing down the door, taking everything away.'' He said he locked the deadbolt on his door, lay down on the bed for a while and then called his mother. The federal government investigated but did not prosecute. In 2011, however, Mr. Swartz went beyond that, according to a federal indictment. In an effort to provide free public access to JSTOR, he broke into computer networks at M.I.T. by means that included gaining entry to a utility closet on campus and leaving a laptop that signed into the university network under a false account, federal officials said. Mr. Swartz turned over his hard drives with 4.8 million documents, and JSTOR declined to pursue the case. But Carmen M. Ortiz, a United States attorney, pressed on, saying that ''stealing is stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars.'' Founded in 1995, JSTOR, or Journal Storage, is nonprofit, but institutions can pay tens of thousands of dollars for a subscription that bundles scholarly publications online. JSTOR says it needs the money to collect and to distribute the material and, in some cases, subsidize institutions that cannot afford it. On Wednesday, JSTOR announced that it would open its archives for 1,200 journals to free reading by the public on a limited basis. Mr. Malamud said that while he did not approve of Mr. Swartz's actions at M.I.T., ''access to knowledge and access to justice have become all about access to money, and Aaron tried to change that. That should never have been considered a criminal activity.'' Mr. Swartz did not talk much about his impending trial, Quinn Norton, a close friend, said on Saturday, but when he did, it was clear that ''it pushed him to exhaustion. It pushed him beyond.'' Recent years had been hard for Mr. Swartz, Ms. Norton said, and she characterized him ''in turns tough and delicate.'' He had ''struggled with chronic, painful illness as well as depression,'' she said, without specifying the illness, but he was still hopeful ''at least about the world.'' Cory Doctorow, a science fiction author and online activist, posted a tribute to Mr. Swartz on BoingBoing.net, a blog he co-edits. In an e-mail, he called Mr. Swartz ''uncompromising, principled, smart, flawed, loving, caring, and brilliant.'' ''The world was a better place with him in it,'' he said. Mr. Swartz, he noted, had a habit of turning on those closest to him: ''Aaron held the world, his friends, and his mentors to an impossibly high standard -- the same standard he set for himself.'' Mr. Doctorow added, however, ''It's a testament to his friendship that no one ever seemed to hold it against him (except, maybe, himself).'' In a talk in 2007, Mr. Swartz described having had suicidal thoughts during a low period in his career. He also wrote about his struggle with depression, distinguishing it from sadness. ''Go outside and get some fresh air or cuddle with a loved one and you don't feel any better, only more upset at being unable to feel the joy that everyone else seems to feel. Everything gets colored by the sadness.'' When the condition gets worse, he wrote, ''you feel as if streaks of pain are running through your head, you thrash your body, you search for some escape but find none. And this is one of the more moderate forms.'' "
Playing Whac-a-Mole With Piracy Sites,"OVER the years, the fight against online piracy has led to countless lawsuits by media companies and to escalating levels of law enforcement, all with mixed results. Lately, though, new attention has turned to an aspect of online commerce that critics say finances online piracy: advertising. Prodding from the White House and a recent academic report have put pressure on the online advertising industry to prevent ads -- for jeans, say, or car insurance -- from appearing on a page offering a free download of Season 2 of ''Game of Thrones.'' Yet these efforts have also been slow to produce results, in part because of the complexity of the online ad system.  This month, the University of Southern California's Annenberg Innovation Lab released a report that ranked 10 ad networks on the amount of business they do with sites suspected of engaging in piracy, with Google and Yahoo placing high on the list. Ad networks use advanced computer algorithms to place ads on Web sites. They can be run by agencies, publishers or others. The implicit criticism of the report is that the operators of these networks know which sites traffic in copyright infringement and therefore could keep ads -- and ad money -- away from them if they wanted to. ''Brands make sure that their ads never show up on porn sites, so we're basically saying, why not do the same with piracy sites?'' said Jonathan Taplin, the director of the Innovation Lab, which is part of U.S.C.'s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. But some of the ad networks cited by the report have disputed its methodology and meaning. And even its supporters complain that the online ad system -- a chain of Web sites, ad servers, digital publishers and agency trading desks that buy and sell ads at a rapid pace -- operates in a way that makes it difficult to know where to point the finger. The researchers studied the fragments of computer code that were appended to the ads they found on sites suspected of piracy over a year. The sites were drawn from a report by Google listing sites that had received the most complaints from copyright holders. Representatives of Google and OpenX, two of the largest companies on U.S.C.'s list, did not deny the prevalence of their codes. But they disputed its meaning, saying that their technology is widely used by third parties -- like ad agency trading desks and advertisers -- so the presence of their code did not necessarily implicate them in a transaction. ''To grossly overcalculate our network, you're also grossly overcalculating how many of these sites we are funding,'' said Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman. Mitch Stoltz, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, was more aggressive, calling the U.S.C. report ''a little bit of analysis resting on false premises.'' The report comes a year after the failure of the Stop Online Piracy Act, a Congressional bill that would have given additional powers to federal law enforcement to prosecute copyright infringement. The bill was supported by the media and entertainment world, but activists and technology companies said it would violate due process and privacy. Since then, the government has tried to press industry to regulate itself. ''We believe that effective enforcement must involve private sector stakeholder efforts,'' Victoria Espinel, the United States intellectual property enforcement coordinator, said in a statement. ''Voluntary best practices must be practical and effective, must respect privacy, due process, competition, free speech, and must protect legitimate uses of the Internet.'' A lack of progress toward self-regulation has frustrated media companies. They say the opacity of the online ad system makes it nearly impossible to hold any party responsible for the ads. ''The ecosystem for online ads is incredibly complicated,'' said Cary Sherman, chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America. ''Everybody can point the finger at other people.'' One example is programmatic buying, a technique used by networks to place ads on sites based primarily on demographics. As a result, a brand may not know every site where its ad will appear. One solution floated in the ad business is a blacklist of offending Web sites. Dick O'Brien, the executive vice president and director of government relations at the American Association of Advertising Agencies, a trade group, said this would be difficult. ''If an organization like ours tries to create a list and organize a boycott, that opens us up to antitrust issues,'' he said. Advertising agencies, including OMD, a digital agency part of the Omnicom Media Group, one of the largest agencies in the world, said they were examining the report, but so far little significant action has been taken. Stephen Kline, the senior counsel for privacy and regulatory matters at the Omnicom Media Group, described the challenge for brands and agencies to identify piracy sites that appear as quickly as they disappear as ''a little bit of Whac-a-Mole.'' As Mr. Taplin of the Innovation Lab sees it, Google has effectively provided a blacklist with its Transparency Report, which lists the sites that have received the most takedown requests from copyright owners. But these are only requests, not proof of illegal behavior. The next edition of the U.S.C. report is due in mid-February. Mr. Taplin said it would name brands that advertise on pirate sites. In an interview, he said he was not ready to identify those brands, but he noted that insurance companies were among the biggest offenders. Mr. Taplin said the report had not been done for any media company or organization, but, as a veteran of the music and film industries, he also made no secret of his sympathies with Big Content. He told the story of his friend Levon Helm of the Band, who died last year. (Mr. Taplin was a producer of the band's 1978 concert film, ''The Last Waltz.'') Mr. Helm, he said, had to tour, despite having cancer, to make up for money he lost from royalties, in part because of piracy. ''That didn't seem fair to me.'' "
E-Mails Of Reporters In Myanmar Are Hacked,"BANGKOK -- Several journalists who cover Myanmar said Sunday that they had received warnings from Google that their e-mail accounts might have been hacked by ''state-sponsored attackers.'' The warnings began appearing last week, said the journalists, who included employees of Eleven Media, one Myanmar's leading news organizations; Bertil Lintner, a Thailand-based author and expert on Myanmar's ethnic groups; and a Burmese correspondent for The Associated Press. Taj Meadows, a Google spokesman in Tokyo, said that he could not immediately provide specifics about the warnings, but said that Google had begun the policy of notifying users of suspicious activity in June.  ''I can certainly confirm that we send these types of notices to accounts that we suspect are the targets of state-sponsored attacks,'' Mr. Meadows said. Google has not said how it determines whether an attack is ''state sponsored'' and does not identify which government may be leading the attacks. Mr. Meadows referred a reporter to an announcement in June by Eric Grosse, the vice president for security engineering at Google, that said that the company could not provide details of its warnings ''without giving away information that would be helpful to these bad actors.'' Ye Htut, a Myanmar government spokesman, and Zaw Htay, a director in the president's office, could not be reached for comment on Sunday. The news media in Myanmar were highly censored and restricted during five decades of military rule, but the government has lifted many of those restrictions since President Thein Sein came to power nearly two years ago. The country, formerly known as Burma, now has thriving weekly publications that are beginning to report on subjects that were once considered taboo, like government corruption and the military's battles with ethnic rebels. But at least two leading private publications, Eleven Media and The Voice Weekly, a news journal, have suffered cyberattacks. Eleven Media's Web site and Facebook page were shut down by hackers several times in the past month, said U Than Htut Aung, the chairman and chief executive of the group. ''This is a direct attack on the media and a step backward for democracy,'' he said. Eleven Media Group posted an article over the weekend saying that the editor of The Voice Weekly and the correspondent for the Japanese news agency Kyodo had also received warnings from Google. Some journalists speculated that attempts to hack into e-mail accounts might be linked to the conflict in northern Myanmar, where ethnic Kachin rebels have engaged in fierce fighting with government troops in recent weeks for control over territory near the Chinese border. Eleven Media was among the first publications to report that the Myanmar military was deploying aircraft to attack the Kachin rebels, a policy that the government denied until reports and photographs appeared in Eleven Media. ''It's their most sensitive state security issue,'' said Mr. Lintner, the expert on ethnic groups. Mr. Than Htut Aung of Eleven Media said that he had heard reports from his staff that members of the Myanmar military were ''very angry'' with their reporting on the Kachin conflict, but he added that it was too early to say whether the military had a role in the cyberattacks. The Myanmar military has received training on cyberwarfare from Russia, Mr. Lintner said. Cyberattacks are not new to the Burmese news media. During military rule, news Web sites run by exiled Burmese activists in Thailand and elsewhere were attacked numerous times by hackers. "
China Won't Cut Its Cyberspying,"LONDON -- President Obama registered his serious concern in the State of the Union address over cyberespionage by what he called ''our enemies.'' His remarks on Feb. 12 came two days after leaks from a U.S. intelligence estimate named China -- again -- as the most serious menace in the cyberdomain. Some Obama advisers have recommended harsh action to send a clear signal to China to change its ways. But even if the Americans retaliate, China is unlikely to respond as they might hope. The spying will continue and probably intensify regardless of what the United States does.  One of the two main complaints against China's espionage is that organizations, both private and governmental, are stealing design secrets from Western corporations on a massive scale. Such theft of intellectual property rights (I.P.R.) is contrary to China's domestic law and international treaty commitments in place for more than a decade. Recent efforts by China to honor its commitments have been substantial considering that it had no such laws for most of its history. But there is a joke in China that its courts are where American corporations go to lose I.P.R. cases. Bilateral cooperation on cyberespionage against each other by the United States and China more or less exhausts itself at this rather unsatisfactory point. It is the second main complaint -- very distinct from I.P.R. theft -- that gives a clearer picture of what is at stake for China in this escalating diplomatic confrontation about cyberthreats. This is the charge that China is actively penetrating critical information infrastructure in the United States with hostile strategic intent. The Obama administration asserts that China, using cyberprobes of various kinds, is occupying certain positions inside the information networks of some critical U.S. infrastructure so that it can interfere with it if a military confrontation over Taiwan became imminent. To planners in China, such activity would be seen as no different from the sort of contingency planning and cyberoperations the United States undertakes toward Chinese military and infrastructure targets. Chinese military analysts and leaders have been studying the United States' use of cyberattacks against critical infrastructure ever since unconfirmed reports surfaced of U.S. attacks in 1999 against Serbia's electricity supply and telephone system. China's view is also colored by the leadership's heavy dependence for political stability on the intelligence services and armed forces, the main perpetrators of the espionage. Yet there is disbelief in China that the United States would expect it to make a principled rejection of military cyberespionage. The Chinese would argue that the United States is doing it, and so should China. There is commitment in China to the idea that in terms of military preparedness in the Information Age, a country has to be able to use cyberassets, if it can, to disable adversary infrastructure on which a military campaign might depend. Last November, the Chinese leadership announced it would hasten the development of information technology for military purposes. Military advisers in China have an easy case to make. Why should China abandon its nonlethal, contingency operations related to possible cyberattacks on critical infrastructure where the United States itself now is vigorously pursuing offensive cyberoptions? The United States, they will say, is the principal architect of a direct and unlawful sabotage attack on the critical infrastructure of Iran in peacetime through Stuxnet. Internal assessments in China paint its cyberwar capability (as opposed to its information siphoning) relative to that of the United States as basic versus advanced. This assessment is shared by some former senior U.S. military officials. Chinese military planners believe that they would only launch a cyberattack on U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of an imminent large scale military clash with the United States over Taiwan. While Americans cannot have equal confidence, and their concern is legitimate, it is the Chinese perception that shapes China's responses. The American case is not helped by its blurring of the two distinct complaints: I.P.R. theft and national security threats. This confusion comes about because some in the United States have assessed that China has an explicit policy of eroding American national economic power through large-scale cyberespionage. This is presented as a form of economic warfare -- an argument that many American analysts dispute. It is true that China has a policy of using any means available -- including covert intelligence collection -- to improve its own technology and, through that, its economic power. After all, it has to get around U.S. high-technology export bans in place for China. But Chinese officials say -- and most foreign economists agree -- that China has a huge vested interest in the stability and vitality of the U.S. economy. The United States has a good and urgent cause to argue for: strategic stability in cyberspace. To work toward that goal with China as an unavoidable partner, the United States will need to make arguments about cyberspying that fit more sensibly than they have so far into a vision of the interconnected, interdependent digital world.

The Brutality Cascade,"Let's say you were a power hitter during baseball's steroids era. You may have objected to steroids on moral and health grounds. But many of your competitors were using them, so you faced enormous pressure to use them too. Let's say you are a student at a good high school. You may want to have a normal adolescence. But you are surrounded by all these junior workaholics who have been preparing for the college admissions racket since they were 6. You find you can't unilaterally withdraw from the rat race and still get into the college of your choice. So you also face enormous pressure to behave in a way you detest.  You might call these situations brutality cascades. In certain sorts of competitions, the most brutal player gets to set the rules. Everybody else feels pressure to imitate, whether they want to or not. The political world is rife with brutality cascades. Let's say you are a normal person who gets into Congress. You'd rather not spend all your time fund-raising. You'd like to be civil to your opponents and maybe even work out some compromises. But you find yourself competing against opponents who fund-raise all the time, who prefer brutalism to civility and absolutism to compromise. Pretty soon you must follow their norms to survive. Or take a case in world affairs. The United States is a traditional capitalist nation that has championed an open-seas economic doctrine. We think everybody benefits if global economics is like a conversation, with maximum openness, mutual trust and free exchange. But along comes China, an economic superpower with a more mercantilist mind-set. Many Chinese, at least in the military-industrial complex, see global economics as a form of warfare, a struggle for national dominance. Americans and Europeans tend to think it is self-defeating to engage in cyberattacks on private companies in a foreign country. You may learn something, but you destroy the trust that lubricates free exchange. Pretty soon your trade dries up because nobody wants to do business with a pirate. Investors go off in search of more transparent partners. But China's cybermercantilists regard deceit as a natural tool of warfare. Cyberattacks make perfect sense. Your competitors have worked hard to acquire intellectual property. Your system is more closed so innovation is not your competitive advantage. It is quicker and cheaper to steal. They will hate you for it, but who cares? They were going to hate you anyway. C'est la guerre. In a brutality cascade the Chinese don't become more like us as the competition continues. We become more like them. And that is indeed what's happening. The first thing Western companies do in response to cyberattacks is build up walls. Instead of being open stalls in the global marketplace, they begin to look more like opaque, rigidified castles. Next, the lines between private companies and Western governments begin to blur. When Western companies are attacked, they immediately turn to their national governments for technical and political support. On the one hand, the United States military is getting a lot more involved in computer counterespionage, eroding the distance between the military and private companies. On the other hand, you see the rise of these digital Blackwaters, private security firms that behave like information age armies, providing defense against foreign attack but also counterattacking against Chinese and Russian foes. Pretty soon the global economy looks less like Monopoly and more like a game of Risk, with a Chinese military-industrial complex on one part of the board and the Western military-industrial complex on another part. Brutality cascades are very hard to get out of. You can declare war and simply try to crush the people you think are despoiling the competition. Or you can try what might be called friendship circles. In this approach, you first establish the norms of legitimacy that should govern the competition. You create a Geneva Convention of domestic political conduct or global cyberespionage. Then you organize as broad a coalition as possible to agree to uphold these norms. Finally, you isolate the remaining violators and deliver a message: If you join our friendship circle and abide by our norms, the benefits will be overwhelming, but if you stay outside, the costs will be devastating. In his effort to fight what he regards as Republican zealots, President Obama is caught between these two strategies. He never quite pushes budget showdowns to the limit to discredit Republicans, but he never offers enough to the members of the Republican common-sense caucus to tempt them to break ranks. Clearly the second option is better for dealing with the Chinese. Establish a Geneva Convention that bans cyberactivity against citizens and private companies. Establish a broad coalition to enforce it. Unfortunately, standard-setting is a dying art these days, so we are living with these brutality cascades. "
Media Editor Is Charged In Hacking of News Site,"8:30 p.m. | Updated Matthew Keys, a 26-year-old deputy social media editor at Thomson Reuters, has been charged with assisting the hacking collective Anonymous in an attack on the Web site of The Los Angeles Times, the Justice Department said Thursday. A federal indictment of Mr. Keys, formerly a Web producer at KTXL Fox 40, which, like The Los Angeles Times, is owned by the Tribune Company, said that he went by a user name of ''AESCracked'' and assisted in a cyberattack on the newspaper's Web site. The attack reportedly allowed the group to gain access and alter a news feature.  The three-count indictment includes charges that Mr. Keys provided Anonymous with login information for computers owned by the Tribune Company. The indictment also states that he encouraged the hackers, with whom he worked from Dec. 10 to Dec. 15, 2010, to log on to the Tribune Company server ''to make unauthorized changes to Web sites'' owned by the company and ''to damage computer systems'' used at the Tribune Company. A Los Angeles Times news article with the headline ''Pressure Builds in House to Pass Tax-Cut Package'' was renamed ''Pressure Builds in the House to Elect CHIPPY 1337,'' according to the indictment. If convicted, Mr. Keys could face up to 10 years in prison for each substantive count and three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 for each count, the Justice Department said in a news release. A spokesman for Reuters said that the news organization was aware of the charges against Mr. Keys and that the alleged misconduct occurred before Mr. Keys joined Reuters in 2012. A spokesman for Tribune Company declined to comment. The charges came as a shock in social media circles where Mr. Keys, considered a wunderkind of new media, cut a popular presence, including being named one of Time Magazine's 140 best Twitter feeds. But the tsunami of social media also appeared to have taken a toll on Mr. Keys. After posting more than 46,000 Twitter messages, Mr. Keys publicly took a break from the social media Web site. In an interview with Ad Week in July, he said Twitter had kept him up at night. ''I got sucked into that. I loved it. I still love it. But at some point you have to take a break,'' Mr. Keys said. (In a Twitter post on Thursday, Mr. Keys again said he intended to take a break.) The length of his potential sentence reignited online protests on Thursday over the way federal prosecutors approached the Internet. Those protests from open Internet proponents like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, exploded in January after the computer programming prodigy Aaron Swartz, also 26 and facing federal charges related to hacking, committed suicide. The charges against Mr. Keys came as other media organizations were facing computer threats. Chinese hackers have compromised the computer systems of several major United States media organizations, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The Ministry of National Defense of China has denied any involvement in the attacks. On Wednesday, President Obama met with chief executives to discuss digital security legislation. In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, he acknowledged the ''ramping up of cybersecurity threats.'' Anonymous, a nebulous and global collective of so-called hactivists, often use computers in protesting or supporting political causes. The group demanded Christmas dinner be provided to Pfc. Bradley Manning, the former Army intelligence officer arrested in 2010 on accusations of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks. In a Twitter message posted last year, Hector Xavier Monsegur, a hacker known as ''Sabu'' who led a hacking collective and worked as an F.B.I. informant, accused Mr. Keys of playing a part in hacking into The Los Angeles Times. Mr. Keys has written about Sabu and Anonymous for Reuters and been associated with hacking groups in the past, including in a Gawker article that identified him as a ''journalist who infiltrated'' Anonymous. ''I identified myself as a journalist during my interaction with top-level Anonymous hackers,'' Mr. Keys wrote on his personal blog in response to the Gawker article. The charges against Mr. Keys were first reported by The Huffington Post. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Luring Young Web Warriors Is a U.S. Priority. It's Also a Game.,"WASHINGTON -- In the eighth grade, Arlan Jaska figured out how to write a simple script that could switch his keyboard's Caps Lock key on and off 6,000 times a minute. When friends weren't looking, he slipped his program onto their computers. It was all fun and games until the program spread to his middle school. ''They called my parents and told my dad I was hacking their computers,'' Mr. Jaska, 17 years old, recalled. He was grounded and got detention. And he is just the type the Department of Homeland Security is looking for. The secretary of that agency, Janet Napolitano, knows she has a problem that will only worsen. Foreign hackers have been attacking her agency's computer systems. They have also been busy trying to siphon the nation's wealth and steal valuable trade secrets. And they have begun probing the nation's infrastructure -- the power grid, and water and transportation systems.  So she needs her own hackers -- 600, the agency estimates. But potential recruits with the right skills have too often been heading for business, and those who do choose government work often go to the National Security Agency, where they work on offensive digital strategies. At Homeland Security, the emphasis is on keeping hackers out, or playing defense. ''We have to show them how cool and exciting this is,'' said Ed Skoudis, one of the nation's top computer security trainers. ''And we have to show them that applying these skills to the public sector is important.'' One answer? Start young, and make it a game, even a contest. This month, Mr. Jaska and his classmate Collin Berman took top spots at the Virginia Governor's Cup Cyber Challenge, a veritable smackdown of hacking for high school students that was the brainchild of Alan Paller, a security expert, and others in the field. With military exercises like NetWars, the competition, the first in a series, had more the feel of a video game. Mr. Paller helped create Cyber Aces, the nonprofit group that was host of the competition, to help Homeland Security, and likens the agency's need for hackers to the shortage of fighter pilots during World War II. The job calls for a certain maverick attitude. ''I like to break things,'' Mr. Berman, 18, said. ''I always want to know, 'How can I change this so it does something else?' '' It's a far different pursuit -- and a higher-minded one, enlightened hackers will say -- than simply defacing Web sites. ''You want people who ask: How do things work? But the very best ones turn it around,'' said Mr. Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a computer security training organization. It's no coincidence that the idea of using competitions came, in part, from China, where the People's Liberation Army runs challenges every spring to identify its next generation of digital warriors. Tan Dailin, a graduate student, won several of the events in 2005. Soon afterward he put his skills to work and was caught breaking into the Pentagon's network and sending reams of documents back to servers in China. ''We have no program like that in the United States -- nothing,'' Mr. Paller said. ''No one is even teaching this in schools. If we don't solve this problem, we're in trouble.'' At Northern Virginia's acclaimed Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, which both Mr. Jaska and Mr. Berman attend, there are five computer science teachers, but none focused on security. When eight students expressed interest in starting a security club, they had to persuade a Raytheon employee to meet with them once a week. (One idea for a name, the Hacking Club, didn't last. ''We don't want people who are going to go around defacing sites,'' Mr. Berman said. They recently rebranded from the Cybersecurity Club to the Computer Security Club. The group dropped the ''Cyber'' because ''it sounds like you're trying to be cool but you're not,'' clarified Mr. Jaska.) Mr. Jaska and Mr. Berman heard about the Virginia competition through their school. To qualify, they had to identify bad passwords and clean up security settings -- a long way from a Caps Lock program. Some 700 students from 110 Virginia high schools applied, but only 40, including Mr. Jaska and Mr. Berman, made the cut. So, three weeks ago, the pair traveled to the Governor's Cup Cyber Challenge at George Mason University. There, they found something they rarely encounter in high school -- a thriving community of like-minded teenagers, the best and brightest of a highly specialized task. ''For some of the kids, who tended to be a little bit loners, this was the first time they had a peer group,'' Mr. Paller said. ''They were having excited conversations about arcane technical issues -- something they never get to do -- and their parents exalted in it.'' The students faced the same five-level test that the military uses to test its own security experts. They earned points for cracking passwords, flagging vulnerabilities and breaking into a Web site administrator's account where, had they changed any settings or defaced a site, they would have been eliminated. Their scores were displayed in real time on a leader board. After several hours, the winners were announced. A third of the students had made it to Level 3 -- a level that Rear Adm. Gib Godwin, chairman of the Governor's Cup, said typically requires someone with seven to 10 years of experience to achieve. Mr. Jaska won, earning a $5,000 scholarship. Mr. Berman won $1,500 for third place. The idea for such competitions is nothing new. For years, a hacking conference called DefCon has hosted games like Capture the Flag in which teams earn points for hacking into each other's computers. The Air Force started a Cyber Patriot competition in which hackers defend against a ''Red Team'' trying to steal data. And the Defense Department has its own Digital Forensics Challenge. But none of these was meant for individual high school students. ''The goal is to create a continuum, similar to the way kids go to junior high, high school, college and get their Ph.D.,'' Admiral Godwin said. ''We want to create the same flow for kids in the cyber domain.'' This summer, Mr. Jaska is hoping to be an intern at Northrop Grumman. Mr. Berman is considering an internship at Homeland Security. But Ms. Napolitano still has some convincing to do. But asked about their dream job, both said they wanted to work in the private sector. ''The problem with going into the government is you're going to make a lot less,'' said Mr. Berman. ''Everything's slower, there's budget cuts and bureaucracy everywhere and you can't talk about what you do,'' Mr. Jaska added. ''It just doesn't seem like as much fun.'' "
"Debate Over Music Piracy Writ Large, On Billboard","Plenty of unknown musicians start arguments over online piracy. Few get the chance to do so on a 15,000-square-foot video billboard overlooking Times Square. For the last week a mysterious ad has flashed on the LED billboard above the American Eagle Outfitters store at Broadway and 46th Street, just over the bronze shoulder of George M. Cohan. Variably positing piracy as ''criminal,'' ''progress'' and ''the future,'' it asks the observer to ''pick a side'' on Twitter, as #artistsforpiracy or #artistsagainstpiracy. The display runs for just 30 seconds, four times an hour, alternating with images of tourists and scantily clad models. But the discussion it has stirred shows that unauthorized file sharing still touches a nerve in the music industry. The campaign asks artists to make what can be a torturous choice: Is it better to charge for music and probably limit your audience, or embrace all the ways music can spread online, without permission or remuneration?  The party behind the billboard and its related Web site, ArtistsVsArtists.com, is Ghost Beach, a two-man Brooklyn band whose profile is low even by indie Brooklyn standards: about 8,800 Facebook likes and zero Pitchfork hits. Ghost Beach was approached by American Eagle, which wanted to license the band's song ''Miracle'' for an online ad. As it has done with a few other bands the retailer offered a fee as well as access to the billboard. The ArtistsVsArtists billboard has been booked for two weeks, ending on Sunday. The group's use of the billboard is worth $50,000, an American Eagle spokeswoman said. ''When we were offered the space on the billboard, we were perplexed about what to do with it,'' said Josh Ocean, 27, the band's lead singer. ''Since we started we've given away all our music for free, so just telling people to purchase our music somewhere didn't seem natural for us. So we said, 'What if we take advantage of this and open up a discussion about the new music industry?' '' The band's manager, Will Suter, has a background in advertising, and approached some agencies. ''I said, 'Our budget is zero, but we have this wonderful canvas,' '' he recalled. TBWA\Chiat\Day New York, one of the world's leading advertising agencies, took the account as a pro bono project and devised a stark, text-heavy design in black, red and white. So far the #artistsforpiracy hashtag has been used far more than #artistsagainstpiracy: 2,802 versus 93 on Tuesday afternoon. But comments by artists (and others) show it is not so easy for them simply to pick a team. One blog writer, identified as a guitar student in Milwaukee, struggled with the idea and concluded, ''So, if anyone wants to support me as a musician, come to my shows, listen to what I have to say, or let me crash on your couch.'' The effect of piracy continues to be intensely debated in the entertainment industry. Many studies have shown that it negatively affects sales, but they have not been unanimous. Last week a European Commission report found that piracy did not hurt digital sales, but music industry groups immediately blasted it as flawed. The ArtistsVsArtists site offers another choice, ostensibly about piracy: pay $5 to download a Ghost Beach EP from iTunes, or get it free from the band. David Lowery of the bands Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker, who has been an outspoken advocate for artists' rights in the digital age, said the site misrepresented piracy. (He was quick to add, though, that he could not blame a struggling band for some clever self-promotion.) ''This conflates piracy and giving music away for free,'' Mr. Lowery said. ''Piracy is eliminating your rights as artists, whereas if you are for copyright, you have the choice to sell your work or give it away.'' Some music industry bloggers were alarmed at the involvement of TBWA\Chiat\Day, which is part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group. The agency's other clients include the Grammy Awards, and the recording industry's official stance on piracy has always been strongly negative. A Grammy spokeswoman had no comment on Tuesday. Ghost Beach's own position is absent from the campaign. In an interview Mr. Ocean and his band mate, Eric Mendelsohn, 26, said they opposed piracy. But they also expressed a pragmatic view of piracy that is widely shared by musicians of their generation: If you can't fight it, at least try to use it. ''We are against piracy in the sense that we are for new technologies and using the Internet in a way that wins over it by us giving away our music directly to fans,'' Mr. Ocean said. ''That way we know where the music is going and can establish that connection directly with fans.'' ''We never want to promote blatantly going out and stealing music,'' he added. ''What we do want to do is offer choices that we think are right.'' "
What's On Today,"11:30 A.M. (AMC) HACKERS (1995) Two New York high school students (played by Angelina Jolie and Jonny Lee Miller) use their hacking skills for mischiefmaking until they stumble upon a corporate extortion scheme and are charged for computer crimes they did not commit. Only through copious in-line skating, frenzied typing and obsolete tech lingo can their names be cleared. Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times about this '90s time capsule directed by Iain Softley, said, ''A lot of attention has gone into the film's video games, computer imagery and costumes, to the point where simply watching these artifacts is half the fun.''  6:15 P.M. (Showtime) THE COMPANY MEN (2010) Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones (above left with Mr. Affleck) and Chris Cooper portray employees of a Boston company confronting downsizing -- the better to justify the chief executive's $22 million salary on the eve of a probable merger. ''Some of the details are wrong,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The Times of this feature-directing debut from John Wells. ''Yet the minor miscalculations pale beside the film's unflinching depiction of the perils of heedless upward mobility that, for all the luxuries it affords, looks pretty grim.'' Playing a man who rose from the factory floor to an executive suite, Mr. Cooper ''gives a great, tragic performance of a man who lashes out like a trapped snake when he realizes that, in his words, 'My life ended, and nobody noticed.' '' 7:30 P.M. (Oxygen) DEFINITELY, MAYBE (2008) A soon-to-be-divorced father (Ryan Reynolds) regales his daughter (Abigail Breslin) with stories about his romantic past, then leaves it to her to figure out which of his loves (names changed to protect the innocent as well as the fairy-tale concept) wound up her mother. Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Weisz and Isla Fisher play the girlfriends. While this ''nimble and winning little romance,'' written and directed by Adam Brooks, is ''hardly perfect, it navigates the choppy waters of modern courtship with commendable, understated honesty,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. 8 P.M. (ABC) HAPPY ENDINGS This series returns after a two-month hiatus with back-to-back episodes. First, Penny (Casey Wilson) and Max (Adam Pally) turn to a black market cough medicine to help them sleep. Then, at 8:30, Alex (Elisha Cuthbert) hits the books to remove her ''dumb blonde'' label, but her friends are not pleased when her newfound knowledge throws off their group dynamic. 8 P.M. (Bravo) BAD BOYS II (2003) Will Smith and Martin Lawrence (from left below) return as a pair of bullet-dodging Miami police detectives with a penchant for car chases. ''Quite a bit was clearly spent on the assaultive, bombastic and occasionally funny spectacle that is 'Bad Boys II,''' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. He added that the film's director, Michael Bay, ''may lack restraint (also taste, wit and shame), but he does have an undeniable flair for sleaze, noise and vulgarity.'' 9 P.M.

A. O. Scott wrote in The Times that Mr. Roth ''dominates the screen,'' adding that the directors, William Karel and Livia Manera, ''succeeded in putting him at ease. He is, for 90 minutes, marvelous company -- expansive, funny, generous and candid.'' 12:30 A.M. (HBO) TOWER HEIST (2011) Some condominium workers, led by Josh Kovaks (Ben Stiller), the building's manager, plot revenge after their life savings disappear at the hands of a resident Wall Streeter (Alan Alda), a Bernard Madoff-like Ponzi schemer. Writing in The Times A. O. Scott called this comedy, directed by Brett Ratner and also starring Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick and Téa Leoni, ''a mild, chaotic and cartoonish dose of populism, set in a Manhattan luxury high-rise at the southwestern corner of Central Park, from which the name 'Trump' has been excised with the utmost digital care.'' Oh, well, he added, ''mediocre entertainment is not a crime -- this is still America, dammit! -- but 'Tower Heist' could and should have been much more.'' ADAM W. KEPLER "
"After Attack on Web, a Shadowy Provocateur Comes Into View","Sven Olaf Kamphuis calls himself the ''minister of telecommunications and foreign affairs for the Republic of CyberBunker.'' Others see him as the Prince of Spam. Mr. Kamphuis, who is actually Dutch, is at the heart of an international investigation into one of the biggest cyberattacks identified by authorities. He has not been charged with any crime and he denies direct involvement. But because of his outspoken position in a loose federation of hackers, authorities in the Netherlands and several other countries are examining what role he or the Internet companies he runs played in snarling traffic on the Web this week. He describes himself in his own Web postings as an Internet freedom fighter, along the lines of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, with political views that range from eccentric to offensive. His likes: German heavy metal music, ''Beavis and Butt-head'' and the campaign to legalize medicinal marijuana. His dislikes: Jews, Luddites and authority. Dutch computer security experts and former associates describe Mr. Kamphuis as a loner with brilliant programming skills. He did not respond to various requests for interviews, but he has communicated with the public through his Facebook page, which includes photos of himself, a thin, angular man with close-cropped hair and dark, bushy eyebrows, often wearing a hoodie sweatshirt.  ''He's like a loose cannon,'' said Erik Bais, the owner of A2B-Internet, an Internet service provider that used to work with Mr. Kamphuis's company, but severed ties two years ago. ''He has no regard for repercussions or collateral damage.'' Mr. Kamphuis's current nemesis is Spamhaus, a group based in Geneva that fights Internet spam by publishing blacklists of alleged offenders. Clients of Spamhaus use the information to block annoying e-mails offering discount Viagra or financial windfalls. But Mr. Kamphuis and other critics call Spamhaus a censor that judges what is or isn't spam. Spamhaus acted, he wrote, ''without any court verdict, just by blackmail of suppliers and Jew lies.'' The spat that rocked the Internet escalated in mid-March when Spamhaus blacklisted two companies that Mr. Kamphuis runs, CB3ROB, an Internet service provider, and CyberBunker, a Web hosting service. Spamhaus contended that CyberBunker was a conduit for vast amounts of spam. CyberBunker says it accepts business from any site as long as it does not deal in ''child porn nor anything related to terrorism.'' Mr. Kamphuis responded by soliciting support for a hackers' campaign to snarl Spamhaus's Internet operations. ''Yo anons, we could use a little help in shutting down illegal slander and blackmail censorship project 'spamhaus.org,' which thinks it can dictate its views on what should and should not be on the Internet,'' he wrote on Facebook on March 23. Mr. Kamphuis later disavowed any direct role in the so-called distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack, which spilled over from Spamhaus to affect other sites. He took to Facebook to inform the world that the flood of Internet traffic that threatened to cripple parts of the Web emanated from Stophaus, an ad-hoc, amorphous group set up in January with the aim to thwart Spamhaus, a company it claims uses its ''tiny business to attempt to control the Internet through underhanded extortion tactics.'' Stophaus, which lists no contact or location for the group, claims to have members in the United States, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, China and Western Europe. Mr. Kamphuis said Stophaus was not a front for him; he is merely acting as a spokesman. Nonetheless, the authorities are curious. The Dutch national prosecutor's office said on Thursday that it had opened an investigation. Wim de Bruin, a spokesman for the agency, which is based in Rotterdam, said prosecutors were first trying to determine whether the DDoS attacks had originated in the Netherlands. Authorities in Britain and several other European countries are also looking into the matter. Mr. Kamphuis, who is believed to be about 35, is singled out because of his vocal role. ''For the Dutch Internet community, it's very clear that he has a big role in this, even if there isn't 100 percent airtight proof that he is behind it,'' said J. P. Velders, a security specialist at the University of Amsterdam. ''He could not be not involved. How much is he involved -- that is for law enforcement to figure out and to act upon.'' Greenhost, a Dutch Internet hosting service, said in a detailed blog post that it had found the digital fingerprints of CB3ROB when it examined the rogue traffic that had been directed at Spamhaus. Mr. Kamphuis created CB3ROB in 1996 and helped set up CyberBunker in 1999. From 1999 to 2001, he worked on the help desk at a Dutch Internet service provider, XS4ALL, according to one senior manager at the company who declined to be named, citing company policy. One co-worker said Mr. Kamphuis was constantly being reprimanded for hacking into his employer's computer system. He was known for eccentric behavior; during a company trip to Berlin, the former co-worker said, Mr. Kamphuis refused to travel with his colleagues and rode alone in a bus. ''Sven absolutely hates authority in any form,'' this person said. ''He was very smart. Too smart for customers, by the way. Oftentimes they couldn't understand his technobabble when he tried to help them.'' After leaving XS4ALL, he continued to run his Web hosting business, which was based for a time in a former army bunker in Goes, the Netherlands. Photos on Mr. Kamphuis's Facebook page show him holding a flag in front of the bunker, like a freedom fighter defending his redoubt. CyberBunker still lists its address as the bunker. But Joost Verboom, a Dutch businessman, says the address is occupied by his own company, BunkerInfra Datacenters, which is building a subterranean Web hosting center at the site. Mr. Verboom said CyberBunker and Mr. Kamphuis left the site a decade ago. It is not clear where the servers of CyberBunker and CB3ROB are now. Associates say Mr. Kamphuis moved to Berlin in about 2006, and his Facebook page displays photos indicating his interest in the Pirate Party, a small political movement focusing on Internet issues that holds some opposition seats in Berlin's city-state government assembly, and in the Chaos Computer Club, a group that discusses computer issues. For a time, CyberBunker's clients included WikiLeaks and The Pirate Bay, a Web site whose founders were convicted by a Swedish court in 2009 of abetting movie and music piracy. In May 2010, six American entertainment companies obtained a preliminary injunction in a German court ordering CB3ROB and CyberBunker to stop providing bandwidth to The Pirate Bay. Since the attacks, Mr. Kamphuis has given television interviews from what appeared to be an empty Internet cafe or office. In a Russian television interview, he suggested that the people responsible for the attacks were in countries where there were no laws against cyberattacks or no serious enforcement. Mr. Kamphuis also continued to provoke people in Facebook postings. ''The Internet is puking out a cancer, please stand by while it is being removed,'' he wrote. "
Hackers List Witnesses In Lebanon Killing Trial,"PARIS -- Hackers broke into a major Lebanese news Web site and plastered the front page with the names of the so-called secret witnesses for the trial in the killing of the former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in an apparent bold, new move to intimidate witnesses and derail the trial. The hacking of the Beirut newspaper last week came on the heels of an earlier publication by another Lebanese newspaper that named 32 witnesses in the trial, which is planned to begin this year. Progress in the case at the United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon has been delayed for years by blocked investigations in Beirut, the killing of a Lebanese investigator, the near-killing of another and the court's bureaucracy.  A spokesman for the tribunal denounced the hacking operation, warning that the authors were endangering the lives of Lebanese citizens. ''It is part of the continuing campaign to undermine the tribunal and intimidating all of the witnesses,'' the spokesman, Marten Youssef, said Friday. International criminal tribunals have been confronted by threats to witnesses and the disclosure of confidential materials before, and a number of lawyers and journalists have been prosecuted for contempt of court. But until now, international courts have not faced a cyberattack of this scale, according to lawyers in The Hague. The hackers broke into the Web site of the newspaper Al Mustaqbal and listed personal data for 167 Lebanese men, including their names, passport pictures, their places and years of birth, cities of residence and professions. The text in Arabic and English said that the information about the witnesses was leaked by the tribunal. Mr. Youssef said that the list published by the hackers was not ''an accurate reflection of the official court records,'' but he gave no further details. What has unfolded is an opaque story full of twists that is now under investigation by the tribunal, the attorney general of Lebanon and the police in the Netherlands, where the tribunal is based. It began Tuesday morning when the newspaper Al Mustaqbal discovered that the front page of its Web site had been taken over by the purported secret witness list, causing much consternation in a small country where many people know one another. The newspaper was owned by Mr. Hariri and still belongs largely to his family. The hackers also directed visitors to a Web site called ''Journalists for the Truth,'' lawyers said. ''We are a group of journalists seeking to unveil corruption in the Special Tribunal for Lebanon,'' the Web site said, adding that it aimed to prove ''bribery'' and ''prejudice and non-professionalism'' of court officials. It also said its mission was to provide legal support to the witnesses ''who face daily temptation or pressure'' from tribunal staff. In what seemed a surreal spin on a Web site that was itself simultaneously publishing the so-called witness list, the site blamed court officials for leaking the confidential information and said that this was an act that ''posed a threat to the lives of many witnesses.'' The Journalists for the Truth site revealed no names or news media affiliation, only an e-mail address. The Dutch police said they had traced the Web site to a registry in the Netherlands, but they said its owners were still unknown. A Lebanese lawyer familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he believed the hackers were supporters of the militant movement Hezbollah, which has long campaigned against the court. The Hezbollah leadership has consistently denied any connection with the Hariri killing and has said it would not cooperate with the tribunal. The tribunal has charged four Hezbollah members in connection with the bombing of Mr. Hariri's car as it drove down a seaside boulevard in Beirut in 2005. The location of the four is unknown, and they would be tried in absentia. Hezbollah officials could not be reached for comment, but the group has previously denied any involvement in the bombing and denounced the tribunal as a tool of the United States and Israel. In Paris last week, Saad Hariri, the dead prime minister's son, who has also served as prime minister, called the hacking and the publication of the possible witnesses in his father's case ''a criminal act.'' He insisted that the tribunal would continue its work and reveal who killed his father and a number of his supporters. For the tribunal, which faces opposition in Lebanon from Hezbollah and its supporters, the listing of names and photographs is a second major setback this year. In January, the newspaper Al Akhbar, which is close to Hezbollah, published similar ''confidential'' lists, revealing pictures and personal details of 32 people it said were witnesses in the case. But the newspaper stopped after it received a warning from Lebanon's attorney general that it was violating judges' orders of confidentiality. Mr. Youssef, the tribunal spokesman, said the prosecution had prepared a still undisclosed list of 500 potential witnesses. But he declined to say whether the published names were among them. ''As a court, we are obviously concerned about the safety of legitimate witnesses,'' he said, ''they are among the most important component of the trial.'' Mr. Youssef added that the anonymous ''journalists' group'' was not credible. ''Let them reveal their identity, and we will engage with any critics,'' he said. A lawyer in The Hague, familiar with the tribunal's work, called the listing of names an astonishing maneuver. ''Without firing a shot or beating up anyone,'' he said, ''they'll manage to scare away all the witnesses.'' "
"Australia Arrests the Professed Head of LulzSec, Which Claims a C.I.A. Hacking","SYDNEY, Australia -- The federal police in Australia have arrested the professed leader of a prominent international hacking collective known as LulzSec, which is perhaps best known for its assertions of being behind a cyberattack that shut down the Central Intelligence Agency's public Web site in 2011.  The Australian Federal Police said that they arrested the 24-year-old Australian citizen on Tuesday night in connection with an attack on an unspecified Australian government Web site this month. The unidentified man, who faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted on two hacking-related charges, is said to have used his position as an I.T. specialist at a Sydney-based company to access confidential information from clients including the Australian government. ''The A.F.P. has zero tolerance for this kind of behavior,'' Glen McEwen, manager of cybercrime operations for the Australian Federal Police, said at a news conference on Wednesday. ''There were no denials of his claims of being the leader.'' ''The A.F.P. believes this man's skill sets and access to this kind of information presented a considerable risk to Australian society,'' Mr. McEwen added. LulzSec, which draws its name from a combination of ''lulz'' -- an Internet coinage derived from ''lol'' for ''laughing out loud'' -- and ''security,'' is a diffuse online community of so-called hacktivists. These hackers differ from mainstream computer criminals in that they claim to be motivated by ideals as opposed to financial gain. The group is reported to have grown out of Anonymous, another ideologically motivated hacking group, and has claimed responsibility for computer attacks on Sony Pictures, Nintendo and a British newspaper, The Sun, owned by Rupert Murdoch. Both groups first gained widespread publicity in 2010 when they waged a series of coordinated cyberattacks in retaliation for efforts to shut down the Web site of the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks. LulzSec is also said to have breached a number of Australian government and university Web sites in 2011. Anonymous claimed responsibility for taking down roughly 10 Australian government Web sites as part of a protest against plans to compel Australian Internet service providers to make private user data available to the country's security services. The Australian police said that the arrested man, who goes by the online moniker Aush0k, had repeatedly asserted in online forums that he was the group's leader. The suspect's online activities had brought him to the attention of international law enforcement authorities before the attack that led to his arrest, the federal police said. His arrest added to a recent string of setbacks for the organization, whose members have been increasingly been targets of law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe. Last year, it was revealed that LulzSec's previous leader, Hector Xavier Monsegur, known online as Sabu, had been providing federal law enforcement officials with information on the hacking group as part of a plea bargain after his arrest in 2011. More recently, an American member of LulzSec, Cody Kretsinger, was sentenced last week by a Los Angeles court to one year in prison for his role in a LulzSec attack on Sony Pictures. Mr. Kretsinger, who used the online moniker Recursion, also pleaded guilty as part of an agreement with prosecutors. "
LivingSocial Hack Exposes Data for 50 Million Users,"LivingSocial, the daily deals site, told its employees Friday that it had been breached, and said that data for 50 million users might have been compromised. In a memo to employees, the company, based in Washington, said online criminals had gained access to user names, e-mail addresses and dates of birth for some users and encrypted passwords for 50 million people. The company's databases that store user and merchant credit card and banking information were not compromised in the attack, it said.  ''We recently experienced a cyberattack on our computer systems that resulted in unauthorized access to some customer data from our servers,'' the company told employees. ''We are actively working with law enforcement to investigate this issue.'' Andrew Weinstein, a spokesman for LivingSocial, confirmed that the attack might have compromised 50 million of its users, and said the company was resetting passwords and would be alerting customers by e-mail. Mr. Weinstein said it would contact customers in all the countries LivingSocial operates with the exception of Thailand, Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines, where its systems were not compromised. The attack on Living Social is just the latest in a string of attacks on consumer Internet companies in recent months. Twitter, Facebook and Apple all stepped forward in February to say they had been the victims of what they described as a ''sophisticated attack.'' Evernote, the notetaking app, said last month that it had reset passwords for 50 million users after it was compromised by hackers. Living Social did say it ''hashed'' passwords -- which involves mashing up users' passwords with a mathematical algorithm -- and ''salted'' them, meaning it appended random digits to the end of each hashed password to make it more difficult, but not impossible, for hackers to crack. Once cracked, passwords can be valuable on auctionlike black market sites where a single password can fetch $20. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Ex-Worker Created Havoc With Hacking, U.S. Says","Michael Meneses did not seem like the type of guy who would end up in federal court, pleading not guilty to charges of computer hacking. For years he commuted from his home in Smithtown, N.Y., on Long Island, to his job as a software programmer at Spellman High Voltage Electronics Corporation, a manufacturer of industrial power supplies in nearby Hauppage. His specialty was known as enterprise resource planning.  But after Mr. Meneses was passed over for promotions, he was upset enough to announce his resignation, giving two weeks' notice. Before his final day in January 2012, colleagues caught him copying files from his computer to a flash drive, the authorities said. They cut off his access to company servers. Soon odd things started happening. Employees at Spellman began reporting that they were unable to process routine transactions and were receiving error messages. An applicant for his old position received an e-mail from an anonymous address, warning him, ''Don't accept any position.'' And the company's business calendar was changed by a month, throwing production and finance operations into disorder. That account was laid out by federal prosecutors on Thursday, who said that Mr. Meneses, using stolen passwords and his high-level knowledge of the computer system, had hacked Spellman's servers and in three weeks caused enough mayhem to cost his former employer more than $90,000. ''The defendant engaged in a 21st-century campaign of cyber-vandalism and high-tech revenge,'' said Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District. Mr. Meneses was arrested Thursday. Investigators traced the e-mail account used to warn off the applicant for his old job to an Internet protocol address that belonged to Mr. Meneses's new employer. They traced the changes to the company calendar to a hotel in Cary, N.C., a short distance from Mr. Meneses's new job. Records from the hotel showed that he was staying there at the time of the online attack. Mr. Meneses, 41, officially denied the allegations in Federal District Court in Central Islip on Thursday and was released on $50,000 bond. He faces up to 10 years in prison. A lawyer for Mr. Meneses, Tracey E. Gaffey, declined to comment. "
"As Chinese Leader's Visit Nears, U.S. Is Urged to Allow Counterattacks on Hackers","WASHINGTON -- With President Obama preparing for a first meeting with China's new president, a commission led by two former senior officials in his administration will recommend a series of steps that could significantly raise the cost to China of the theft of American industrial secrets. If milder measures failed, the commission said, the United States should consider giving companies the right to retaliate against cyberattackers with counterstrikes of their own. The recommendations are from the private Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, which is led by two figures who parted company with the White House on strained terms: Dennis C. Blair, Mr. Obama's first director of national intelligence, and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former ambassador to China who left his post to run, unsuccessfully, for the Republican nomination for president.  ''China is two-thirds of the intellectual property theft problem, and we are at a point where it is robbing us of innovation to bolster their own industry, at a cost of millions of jobs,'' Mr. Huntsman said, with a bluntness that would have been forbidden when he served in Beijing. ''We need some realistic policy options that create a real cost for this activity because the Chinese leadership is sensitive to those costs.'' The commission's report will be published Wednesday, two days before Mr. Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, travels to Beijing to prepare for the meeting between Mr. Obama and Xi Jinping, China's new president. That two-day meeting, scheduled to start in California on June 7, has been highly choreographed on both sides. Mr. Donilon was preceded to Beijing by Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, Secretary of State John Kerry and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey. All have prepared to line up new initiatives, consultations and military-to-military exchanges intended to show a maturing relationship between the world's two largest economies. But the recent disclosures about Chinese cyberattacks and the theft of industrial secrets, an operation managed partly from a Chinese People's Liberation Army unit outside Shanghai, may affect the ability of Mr. Xi and Mr. Obama to forge anything the two men could claim to be a partnership. The new effort is similar to what Mr. Obama tried with Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi's predecessor, which despite a promising start during the 2009 financial crisis quickly went sour. For the last three years, relations between the two countries have been dominated by disputes with China over its territorial claims and arguments over how to pressure North Korea and Iran. Mr. Donilon, who has taken on the management of relations with China as a personal project, has begun to address the cyberattacks and intellectual property theft in public speeches, and he has made the argument that they must move to the center of the Sino-American relationship. He has steered clear of specific steps the United States was willing to take in response, and he has been more delicate about the subject than the Pentagon, which recently issued a blistering report that for the first time named the People's Liberation Army as the source of much of the espionage against American companies and government facilities. In a sign of the diplomatic delicacy of the accusations, the White House would not say if it had reviewed the report; the Pentagon said it had been fully vetted. The new report does propose specific remedies. One is to mandate that foreign companies that want to be listed on stock exchanges in the United States first pass a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission about whether they use stolen intellectual property. ''They all want their shares to be traded here, so this would impose a real cost,'' Mr. Blair said. Similarly, whether companies protect intellectual property would be considered by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which judges whether an investment in the United States could pose a security risk. Currently it looks only at national security implications of investments; this would add a new criterion. But the commission also said that Congress should ''greatly expand the number of green cards available to foreign students who earn science, technology, engineering and mathematics degrees in American universities and who have a job offer'' in the United States, to ensure that they have an incentive to stay in the United States rather than return home with knowledge they can use to compete with American companies. That recommendation would probably run headlong into the immigration debate in the United States. Some of the most interesting recommendations deal with combating China's role in cyberattacks, likely to rank among the most delicate subjects in Mr. Obama's meeting with Mr. Xi. The commission argued that American companies ''ought to be able to retrieve their electronic files or prevent the exploitation of their stolen information'' by designing their computer files to self-destruct if they fall into the wrong hands. But the authors of the report also say that if the damage ''continues at current levels,'' the government should consider allowing American companies to counterattack -- essentially taking cyberwar private. ''If counterattacks against hackers were legal, there are many techniques that companies could employ that would cause severe damage to the capability'' of the Chinese or other groups committing computerized theft, the report said. But it added a qualifier: ''while properly empowered law enforcement authorities are mobilized.'' Many in the administration have opposed such ideas, fearing that they could lead to a cycle of escalation between the United States and other nations that could easily spin out of control. The report also said that as a last-ditch measure, Congress could impose a tariff on all Chinese products, ''designed to raise 150 percent of all U.S. losses from Chinese'' thefts. That measure could easily run into challenges as a violation of international trade law. Mr. Obama will seek to defuse the tensions by holding the meeting with Mr. Xi at the Annenberg estate in California, allowing the two men and their top aides to have two days in near isolation. It is a highly unusual step -- Mr. Obama has rarely invited foreign leaders even to Camp David. A National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, said, ''We have no illusions about this.'' Mr. Obama, she said, ''seeks to expand the areas of cooperation in managing regional and global challenges -- and we seek to manage our differences in a way that prevents disruptive and unhealthy competition from undermining our interests.''

Bronx Officer Is Accused Of Hiring E-Mail Hackers,"It was the sort of discovery that is usually the mark of good police work: A Bronx detective came upon an online criminal enterprise that offered -- for a low price -- to hack into private e-mail accounts. But the detective was not seeking to build a case against the outfit, federal prosecutors said on Tuesday. Rather, prosecutors said, he became a client.  Using information bought from the hackers, the detective, Edwin Vargas, obtained login information for at least 43 e-mail accounts associated with 30 people, including at least 19 members of the New York Police Department in the Bronx, according to a complaint unsealed in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The reason for the digital snooping appeared to be personal, law enforcement officials said: Detective Vargas, 42, suspected a former girlfriend -- also an employee of the Police Department, an official said -- had started a new relationship with a fellow officer. Detective Vargas and the woman had a child together, officials said, but had broken up. ''A 20-year veteran of the Police Department, never before under suspicion for any impropriety, let alone any criminal activity,'' James Moschella, a lawyer for the detective's union, said of Detective Vargas, whom he represented at the arraignment. Detective Vargas was released on $50,000 bond. ''It's my understanding that some of the victims are detectives as well,'' said Michael J. Palladino, the head of the detectives' union. ''It would be inappropriate for me to comment any further.'' Prosecutors said that over the course of two years beginning in 2010, Detective Vargas contacted the e-mail hacking group multiple times and paid about $4,050 for the login information for accounts of fellow officers and some private citizens. He paid between $50 and $250 per account, according to the complaint, using a credit card or PayPal account registered to his Bronx address. The low prices suggested that, for the hackers, the e-mail account information was not difficult to obtain. It was not clear what was done with the information obtained. Detective Vargas is accused of gaining access to only one of the accounts for which he obtained login details. The complaint did not identify those targeted. Prosecutors also accused the detective of accessing online records for a cellphone belonging to one of the victims. The Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted the investigation along with the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau. Law enforcement officials said it was during the course of a broader, continuing investigation into a Los Angeles-based e-mail hacking operation that investigators found accounts belonging to the New York police officers had been hacked. Detective Vargas, who joined the department in 1993, was arraigned on charges of conspiracy to commit computer hacking and of unlawful access to a law enforcement database. The second charge came from what prosecutors said was an unauthorized use of a national crime database by Detective Vargas to look up information about two officers whose e-mails he had also obtained. He did so, prosecutors said, from a Bronx precinct where he worked, though the complaint did not specify which one. Detective Vargas had worked at the 44th Precinct, where officials said some of the police officers targeted were based, but was currently assigned to the 40th Precinct. ''Of all places, the Police Department is not a workplace where one should have to be concerned about an unscrupulous fellow employee,'' said George Venizelos, the head of the F.B.I.'s New York office. "
Hagel Calls For Action To Protect Cyberspace,"SINGAPORE -- In remarks directed at China, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke Saturday of a ''growing threat'' of cyberattacks against the United States and called on America and its allies to ''establish international norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace.'' Speaking to an audience of defense analysts and defense ministers from Asia and Europe at the annual conference of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Mr. Hagel said the United States was ''cleareyed about the challenges in cyber.''  ''The United States has expressed our concerns about the growing threat of cyberintrusions, some of which appear to be tied to the Chinese government and military,'' he said in a speech largely devoted to the Obama administration's defense posture in Asia. At the same time, Mr. Hagel emphasized the need for more talks between the American and Chinese militaries to build trust and reduce the risk of miscalculation at a time of mounting rivalry. His remarks were immediately challenged by a Chinese general in a question-and-answer session after his speech. A delegate to the conference, Maj. Gen. Yao Yunzhu, director of the Center for China-America Defense Relations at the Academy of Military Science in Beijing, said she was not convinced -- and China was not convinced -- that the United States wanted a ''comprehensive'' relationship with China. The new American policy in Asia and the Pacific amounts to containment of China, General Yao said. Speaking a week before a summit meeting in California between President Obama and China's new leader, Xi Jinping, Mr. Hagel sought to reassure Washington's nervous Asian allies, who are concerned about China's expanding naval activities, that the United States would maintain its presence in the region. Over all, he said, the United States will keep its ''decisive military edge,'' an oblique but distinct reference to American military superiority. China announced an 11.2 percent increase in military spending last year, part of its rapid military modernization. He emphasized that new technologies would entail spending fewer resources in a smarter way, saying that the Navy had launched an experimental drone from an aircraft carrier last month for the first time. It was a feat that ushered in a new era of naval aviation, he said. Unstated, but understood by many in the audience, was the fact that China just last year put into service its first aircraft carrier, an old Ukrainian vessel refitted by the Chinese. Mr. Hagel also said the United States would deploy a solid-state laser aboard the Ponce, a naval vessel, next year. He said it would provide ''an affordable answer'' to counter threats like ''missiles, swarming small boats and remotely piloted aircraft.'' He said that the first of four littoral combat ships to rotate through Singapore had recently arrived, and that he would visit the ship, the Freedom, on Sunday. The littoral combat ship is a new class of speedy war vessels that can operate on the ocean and in shallow coastal waters. Each costs $700 million, the Pentagon says. In a feisty address that opened the conference, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung of Vietnam laid bare the rising regional tensions by repeatedly lamenting the lack of trust between China and its neighbors, and between China and the United States, although he did not mention China by name. Regional organizations are supposed to take care of such tensions, he said, but what is ''still missing is strategic trust in the implementation of these arrangements.'' As evidence of the problems, several diplomats from nations allied with the United States said they were concerned about a new map of the South China Sea that was issued last week by Sinomaps Press, the Chinese mapping authority. Beijing has long claimed the islands and land ''features'' within a nine-dash line drawn decades ago on maps of the South China Sea, a vital trade route where China is growing more assertive. About 80 percent of the South China Sea is inside that line, which was first drawn up by China in 1947 before the Communist takeover. The boundary is not recognized by any other country but has been the basis of China's territorial claims to islands like the Scarborough Shoal, which it effectively seized from the Philippines last year. The new map, according to Asian diplomats who have seen it, takes a further step and redesignates the nine-dash line as a national boundary. Its release was delayed from late last year so that it could be formally authorized by the Chinese senior leadership, according to a senior Asian diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. Wu Shicun, a Chinese official at the conference, denied that the new map showed national boundaries. Instead, he said, it shows new lines around the islands that China calls the Diaoyu, a group in the East China Sea that Japan, which calls them the Senkaku, nationalized in September, leading Beijing to claim them. At the time, China said the lines around the islands were drawn in accordance with Chinese law. A recent Pentagon report said they did not comport with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Mr. Wu, who heads the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said Saturday that the new map was needed because there had not been an official map of the South China Sea and the East China Sea drawn for about 20 years. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
France Appears Poised to Soften a Law Aimed at Deterring Internet Piracy,"SERRAVAL, France -- A French experiment in cracking down on digital media piracy by threatening to kick copyright cheats offline is about to end -- without solving the problem. In 2009, French lawmakers, aiming to curb unauthorized file-sharing and to slow the erosion of media industry revenue, approved what was billed as the toughest anti-piracy law in the world. Repeat offenders who ignored two warnings to quit downloading movies or music illegally were confronted with the prospect of a suspension of their Internet connection. The system was emulated in several other countries, including the United States, though generally with softer penalties. But now the government of President François Hollande appears poised to shut down the agency that was created to enforce the law, imposed under Mr. Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, and to defang the measure of much of its menace.  Fleur Pellerin, the French minister in charge of Internet policy, said during a recent visit to a high-technology complex in Sweden that suspending Internet connections was incompatible with the French government's hopes of spurring growth in the digital economy. ''Today, it's not possible to cut off Internet access,'' she said. ''It's something like cutting off water.'' A report on digital policy that was prepared for the government by Pierre Lescure, the former president of the pay-television company Canal Plus, in April recommended dropping the threat of disconnections and replacing it with a fine of &#x20ac;60, or $78, for repeat offenders. The report also recommended disbanding the enforcement agency, known by its French acronym, Hadopi, and subsuming some of its functions in the French media regulator, Conseil supérieur de l' audiovisuel. While government ministers have voiced support for Mr. Lescure's recommendations, some lawmakers, including Patrick Bloche, an influential Socialist deputy, have suggested that the administration should go further and simply scrap the entire system of warnings and potential penalties. Despite all the debate that the system has prompted, in and outside France, evidence of its effects remains skimpy. A study by researchers at Wellesley College near Boston and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh that was published last year showed that the threat of disconnection was directing more French Internet users toward Apple's iTunes store, a licensed source of digital music. Separate studies, commissioned by Hadopi, have shown a decline in illegal file sharing. Yet the French music business remains deeply troubled. SNEP, a French recording company group, said Friday that industry revenue fell by 6.7 percent in the first quarter of the year. More alarmingly, revenue from digital outlets fell by 5.2 percent -- the first quarterly decline -- though the organization said several special factors played a role in this. Meanwhile, SNEP said the number of visits to illegal music sites by French Internet users had risen by 7 percent between January 2010 and January 2013, to 10.7 million. Guillaume Leblanc, director general of SNEP, said the group was willing to accept dropping the threat of disconnection, as long as the warning system was preserved, but said the proposed &#x20ac;60 fine was too low. ''Maintaining graduated response is essential for the music industry,'' he said. ''For the legal offer to keep developing, it's important to have strong copyright protection on the Internet.'' While Hadopi has sent out hundreds of thousands of warnings to those suspected of being pirates, only a handful of cases have reached the third and supposedly final stage. Several of these were thrown out by the courts; others resulted in fines or suspended sentences. ''If you cannot chop off a few heads as an example, then the chopping machine inspires less fear,'' said Jérémie Zimmermann, spokesman for La Quadrature du Net, a group that has campaigned against the law. Supporters of the law say cutting off large numbers of Internet connections was never the point. ''From our standpoint this was always meant to be an educational and deterrent measure,'' said Frances Moore, chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a trade group. The Lescure report recommends that the downgraded penalty -- a fine rather than disconnection -- be accompanied by greater certainty that it would be applied, through the adoption of an administrative court procedure, like the one used for minor traffic violations. A downgrade of the French system would leave South Korea, which also imposed a similar system in 2009, as the country with perhaps the toughest anti-piracy measures in place. More than 400 Internet accounts or Web sites have been suspended in South Korea since the law went into effect. Recording industry revenue in South Korea rose by 26 percent from 2008 through 2012, a period in which sales worldwide fell by 14 percent, according to the international recording industry federation. Whether the law is responsible for the gains is debatable; the surge has coincided with the K-Pop phenomenon, in which South Korean acts like Psy and his ''Gangnam Style'' have taken the world by storm. The law is unpopular with free-speech groups, which are campaigning for a repeal. In March, the Korean National Human Rights Commission recommended that the measure should be reviewed to determine whether it clashes with constitutional protections. Elsewhere, countries that have adopted systems involving warnings and penalties, also known as graduated response, have tended to opt for less draconian measures than France or South Korea, sometimes involving private-sector deals rather than legislation. In the United States, for example, five major Internet providers recently agreed to put in place a so-called copyright alert system, negotiated with the entertainment industry. Sanctions, which can include a temporary slowdown in Internet access speed, do not kick in until an account holder ignores at least five warnings. Analysts say that the backtracking by the French could lessen legislators' enthusiasm for graduated response systems in other countries, at least if they involve the threat of disconnection. ''Looking at this politically, if one of the few countries where they were able to get the political support to pass this -- if they get rid of it, it could make it harder to do graduated response elsewhere,'' said Brett Danaher, a professor at Wellesley College who worked on the study examining the effects of Hadopi on iTunes sales. He and others said the entertainment industry and policy makers might now turn more of its attention to efforts to block Web sites that host content that infringes on copyright, rather than going after individual Internet users. Ms. Moore said neither strategy would provide an easy solution. ''We have to take a holistic approach,'' she said. ''Web site blocking and alert systems are just two tools.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Chinese State Media Suggest That N.S.A. Disclosures Will Hurt U.S. Ties,"HONG KONG -- After several days of relative silence on the issue, Chinese state news media Thursday highlighted revelations that the United States government was engaged in widespread monitoring of Internet and telephone communications, carrying reports suggesting the disclosures could damage relations between the two countries. The disclosures come at an uncomfortable time for American officials, just after President Obama pressed for Beijing's cooperation in curtailing Chinese cyberespionage. Chinese government officials have refrained from directly criticizing the United States on the disclosures, but the state news media have been reporting on the controversy.  ''The massive U.S. global surveillance program revealed by a former National Security Agency employee in Hong Kong is certain to stain Washington's overseas image and test developing Sino-U.S. ties,'' said an article in the state-run newspaper China Daily, citing analysts. It quoted Li Haidong, a researcher of American studies at China Foreign Affairs University, warning of the impact the disclosure could have on relations between the United States and China. ''For months, Washington has been accusing China of cyberespionage, but it turns out that the biggest threat to the pursuit of individual freedom and privacy in the U.S. is the unbridled power of the government,'' Mr. Li was quoted as saying. Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. computer technician who disclosed the surveillance, is now believed to be in Hong Kong, which is administered by China but has a large degree of legal autonomy. As American officials pursue possible charges against him in preparation for an extradition effort, the authorities in Hong Kong, rather than the mainland government, are likely to decide whether to turn Mr. Snowden over to the United States, which has a long history of cooperation with Hong Kong on such matters. Mr. Snowden said Wednesday in an interview with The South China Morning Post that the United States had gained access to hundreds of computers in Hong Kong and China since 2009. One mainland news outlet, The Global Times, a newspaper that is part of the Communist Party-run People's Daily group, called for assertive Chinese action to confront Washington in the wake of Mr. Snowden's revelations. ''Before the U.S. government rushes to shut Snowden's mouth, China also needs to seek an explanation from Washington,'' the newspaper said in an editorial. ''We are not bystanders. The issue of whether the U.S. as an Internet superpower has abused its powers touches on our vital interests directly.'' For the Chinese media, coverage of the issue can be a delicate balancing act, since the allegations that the United States is employing a double standard naturally focuses attention on its assertions that Chinese entities are engaged in widespread cyberspying, an issue that Chinese state media outlets have shied away from. There is also the tricky issue of Mr. Snowden's presence on Hong Kong soil, a potentially problematic development as China and the United States have recently worked to improve relations. Officials in the United States have rebuffed suggestions that the surveillance by the N.S.A. was in any way comparable to Chinese cyberspying. One intelligence employee, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue, said the two situations -- China's stealing of trade and military secrets and N.S.A. surveillance to track possible terrorist attacks -- were not comparable. ''I can tell you with absolute certainty the U.S. government does not pass on technological secrets obtained through (strictly speaking, as a byproduct of) espionage to U.S. firms, both as a matter of principle and because there is no fair way to do it,'' he wrote in answer to an e-mailed question. ''I recall some senior bureaucrat proposing this some two decades ago -- and he got nowhere,'' he wrote. ''None of the agencies wanted anything to do with it.'' ''China, by contrast, deliberately targets foreign technology for military and commercial purposes, so this is apples and oranges,'' he wrote. ''But in the propaganda war, that fact won't matter.'' While meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in California last week, Mr. Obama pressed the issue of Chinese cyberspying, but Mr. Xi did not acknowledge any culpability. At a daily news briefing Thursday, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was pressed repeatedly to address Mr. Snowden's disclosures, but said she had ''no relevant information to supply.'' "
This Isn't How to Stop Hacking,"WUHAN, China -- When we landed in China early this week, we hadn't realized that a long holiday, the Dragon Boat Festival, was about to begin. It took us a little while to figure out why traffic was so light in Beijing, and why the offices where we were meeting officials were so deserted. We were a handful of journalists on a three-city tour that included Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan, an industrial city in central China. (The trip was organized by the China-United States Exchange Foundation, which organizes trips for Western journalists to China a handful of times per year.)  The news about Edward Snowden had just broken, and it was much on our minds. To us, at least, it seemed to scream for a Chinese response. Snowden, a 29-year-old employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, had leaked information about a huge program conducted by the National Security Agency to obtain a record of every phone call made in the United States. He also leaked news of another program, Prism, that gathered information from Facebook, Apple and other tech companies about the cyberactivity of customers. The revelations were astonishing. Now Snowden was hiding out somewhere in Hong Kong, popping up just long enough to grant the occasional interview. What would China do if, say, Snowden asked for asylum? And what did China have to say about all this spying by the U.S. government? Not much, at least not at first. In one early meeting, the official answering our questions knew so little about l'affaire Snowden that he asked us to walk him through it. ''It sounds like Hong Kong has quite a problem,'' he grinned. Yes, we all concluded: It had to be the lingering effects of the Dragon Boat Festival. It's not that there weren't other things that Chinese officials wanted to talk about. But most of their observations began with the idea that their government was trying to be the ''good'' superpower, wanting harmonious relations with the United States, while the Americans continued to act in provocative ways, putting peace-loving China on edge. Topping the list of such ''provocations'' was the accusation made by the Obama administration that China has been hacking into American computers. Is China hacking? Of course it is -- on a broad scale. A report issued in February by the Mandiant Group was close to definitive. It traced a group of hackers to a building owned by the People's Liberation Army. Yet any question broached on the subject brought furious rebuttals. China did not hack American computers, we were told. Our so-called evidence was pathetic. Zhang Ping, the vice president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, described the hacking allegations as ''defamation.'' Chinese computers were hacked every day, he said. It was the classic Chinese response to allegations it didn't want to discuss. We soon saw another classic response. After he had been in Hong Kong a few days, Snowden gave another interview in which he said that the United States had routinely hacked into Chinese computers. In addition to suddenly improving his chances of gaining asylum, Snowden had given the Chinese the ammunition they had been looking for. All over the country, a magic switch went on. Thousands of writers and editors who hadn't dared touch the Snowden story on Tuesday couldn't get enough of it on Wednesday. ''The U.S. Has Attacked Chinese Networks for 15 Years,'' said a headline in The Yangtze Daily. ''Snowden Leaks Information About Prism to Reveal the Hypocrisy of the U.S. Government,'' added The Wuhan Evening News. China Daily quoted a Chinese expert on American affairs saying, ''For months, Washington has been accusing China of cyberespionage, but it turns out the biggest threat to the pursuit of individual freedom and privacy in the U.S. is the unbridled power of the government.'' I don't know whether Prism and the other programs truly stop terrorists. I have my doubts. What I do know is that if you are going to lecture the world about right and wrong -- and if you're trying to stop bad behavior -- perhaps you shouldn't be engaging in a version of that behavior yourself. Instead, this has become one of the trademarks of the Obama administration: decry human rights abuses abroad, but hold men in prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, who have never been accused of a crime. Say all the right things about freedom of the press -- even as you're subpoenaing reporters' phone records. And express outrage over Chinese hacking while carrying on a sophisticated spying operation of your own citizens. It may seem to us a false equivalence, but the existence of Prism will make it far more difficult to force the Chinese to get serious about stopping their own hacking. Maybe America's new motto should be: Do As We Say, Not As We Do. "
Retired U.S. General Is Focus Of Inquiry Over Iran Leak,"WASHINGTON -- The former second-ranking officer in the United States military, retired Gen. James E. Cartwright of the Marines, is a target of an investigation into the leak of classified information about American cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear program, a person familiar with the investigation confirmed Thursday night.  The leak investigation, being carried out by the United States attorney for Maryland, Rod J. Rosenstein, was announced by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. after articles in The New York Times described an ambitious series of cyberattacks under the code name Olympic Games that were intended to slow Iran's progress toward a nuclear bomb. That General Cartwright is a focus of the leak inquiry was first reported by NBC News. The general, 63, who served as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2007 to 2011, became a favorite adviser of President Obama and was considered an influential voice in the White House on security matters. A lawyer for General Cartwright, Gregory B. Craig, who served as White House counsel early in the Obama administration, declined to comment. Marcia Murphy, a spokeswoman for Mr. Rosenstein, declined to confirm or deny whether General Cartwright was being investigated. ''We don't have any comment at all,'' Ms. Murphy said. Since his retirement in 2011, General Cartwright has joined the Center for Strategic and International Studies and has spoken in favor of major cuts in nuclear weapons and warned of possible ''blowback'' from the use of drone aircraft by the United States in Pakistan and Yemen. Asked about the NBC News report, Jill Abramson, executive editor of The New York Times, said, ''We don't comment on our confidential sources.'' Since President Obama took office in 2009, seven current or former government officials or contractors have been charged under the Espionage Act with leaking classified information, compared with three under all previous presidents. The seventh person charged was Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who has acknowledged giving classified documents to The Guardian and The Washington Post. Press advocates have criticized the unprecedented crackdown on leaks, in which F.B.I. investigators have used e-mail and telephone records to track exchanges between reporters and sources, saying it endangers reporting on national security. But Mr. Obama and Mr. Holder have said that leaks can put American security at risk. "
If Hackers Inherit The Earth,"There's bad news in Wednesday night's episode of ''Through the Wormhole With Morgan Freeman,'' on the Science Channel. The annoying epidemic of hacking on television could be about to get a lot worse and a lot more far-fetched. ''Through the Wormhole'' is an always interesting exploration of new research and provocative ideas in the scientific world. Episode titles since the series began in 2010 have included ''Did We Invent God?,'' ''Is There a Superior Race?'' and ''Can We Eliminate Evil?'' On Wednesday the question of the night is ''Can Our Minds Be Hacked?''  We can surmise from recent news reports that any electronic device -- a cellphone, a laptop, a hearing aid, an electric toothbrush -- can not only be hacked or monitored by government agencies and cybercriminals, but probably also is being hacked or monitored. Pretty much any headline you can envision will be coming along within the next few days. ''Secret N.S.A. Toothbrush-Monitoring Program Finds Few Americans Are Reaching Rearmost Molars.'' But devices will be irrelevant in the future suggested by the ''Through the Wormhole'' episode. ''What if hackers learned to read, or tamper with, our most precious and private store of data, the contents of our minds?'' Mr. Freeman, the show's host, says in his ominous introduction. ''Hacking into our thoughts requires decoding the logic of our neurons,'' he adds. ''Science is getting close to achieving that goal.'' The episode checks in on Marc Salem, whose popular stage shows feature what seem like mind-reading tricks, and on an effort to create a communication device for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) that would read the electrical pulses of their brains. ''By seeing the activation of particular brain structures, we can tell, 'Ah, this person is trying to move his hands,' '' explains Philip Low, a neuroscientist. Then it's off to a lab in California that has been scanning people's brains as they watch videos to look for correlations between where blood is flowing at specific moments and the images on the screen. It's a primitive exploration of a way to tell what people are thinking. Other researchers are looking at ways to alter thoughts and capabilities once the brain has been hacked. Beware of your own nose. ''Computer hackers write programs called 'cracks' to break into secure systems,'' Mr. Freeman says. ''Could your sense of smell be a crack for a brain hacker?'' While contemplating that, also contemplate this: The coming age of brain hacking could exacerbate an already irksome television trend. For several years now, a stock character has been turning up in shows of all sorts: the superhacker, a person the protagonist can call to work some keyboard wizardry that gets that protagonist out of a jam. Sometimes the superhacker is in law enforcement, but other times it's just some guy or gal with a laptop. The superhacker frees scriptwriters to put a protagonist into absurdly impossible situations. ''Hey, I'm locked inside this museum I was trying to rob,'' to paraphrase a recent episode of the Cinemax series ''Banshee.'' ''Can you hack into its computers and override its security systems?'' Tap, tap, tap on the keyboard; problem solved. This is a downgrade from old-fashioned derring-do, as becomes evident if we project superhackers back in time. Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones is on his quest when a giant boulder starts rolling toward him. He calls his superhacker friend: ''Can you hack into the temple's computer system and activate the boulder brake?'' The movie makes $150,000 instead of becoming one of the top-grossing films in history. Television writers enjoy high-tech flourishes like superhackers because they know that average viewers who have trouble uploading a photo from a cellphone will have no way to judge how credible these scenes are. And so although we know from the news that superhackers exist, they are among the things that are far more common on television than they are in real life (a club that also includes serial killers, business deals struck in strip clubs and 8-year-olds who spout grown-up wisdom). Do most of us have a superhacker to call when we can't find miniature marshmallows in the grocery? (''Can you hack into the Stop & Shop's inventory grid for me?'') No, we do not. All of this suggests that mind hacking will be coming soon to a series near you as TV tries to stay ahead of the real-life curve. The ''Through the Wormhole'' episode is unclear as to whether in the future just anyone will be able to hack someone else's brain, or if it will require expertise. But presumably when the plot device begins turning up -- next season? the season after? -- it will follow the established call-for-help pattern. Beat cop, eyeballing a suspicious-looking fellow on the sidewalk: ''Hi, Officer Jacobs here, working the Diamond district. Can you patch me through to the mind-hack unit? I need them to brain-hack this dude to see if he's thinking about robbing a jewelry store.'' No chase, no exchange of gunfire; just a tap, tap, tap on a keyboard. Somewhere, Indiana Jones is shaking his head in dismay. "
Differences On Cybertheft Complicate China Talks,"WASHINGTON -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. opened annual strategic talks with senior Chinese leaders here on Wednesday by repeating the United States' accusation that the electronic theft of American intellectual property could undermine the relationship between the world's two largest economies. And to no one's surprise, the Chinese had an answer ready: that the publication of secret documents showing the extent of American surveillance of Chinese universities and other institutions undercuts the Obama administration's case.  That friction, American officials conceded in private, underscores how difficult it will be for the United States to make progress on what President Obama and his top aides have said is now a central issue between two countries whose economies are intertwined and whose militaries are in competition. And at a time when the Chinese economy is showing signs that it is headed into a period of slower growth, the administration's hopes of persuading Chinese leaders to crack down on the daily barrage of theft and espionage over the Internet -- considered crucial to keep China competitive -- is likely to be even more difficult. ''We both will benefit from an open, secure, reliable Internet,'' Mr. Biden said at the opening of the talks, the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, an annual effort to bring together top Chinese and American cabinet and subcabinet officials on a range of problems. ''Outright cyber-enabling theft that U.S. companies are experiencing now must be viewed as out of bounds and needs to stop.'' Mr. Biden was making the same point that Mr. Obama repeated in recent weeks, including during a meeting with China's new president, Xi Jingping, in California. To the Americans, China's cybertheft -- often directed by units of the People's Liberation Army -- is different, and far more corrosive, than standard government espionage. An American official who was sent out to brief reporters after the first day of talks said that when it came to the theft of intellectual property -- including the designs of commercial products and military aircraft -- ''we don't do it, and we don't think any country should do it.'' China has always viewed the issue differently, seeing far less of a distinction involving what it regards as issues of economic and military security. ''For many Chinese, it is bizarre that how Washington can continue to pose as the biggest cyberespionage victim and demand others behave well,'' China Daily, a government-influenced publication, wrote before the meeting, ''after former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed that U.S. spy agencies hacked deep into China and other countries' computer networks, including those of government, military, research, educational and business organizations.'' It concluded that ''by dividing cyberespionage into 'bad' and 'good' activities, Washington is trying to dictate the rules for global cyberdomain, which is a public space.'' American and Chinese cyberexperts met Monday for the first time in a working group intended to address the issue. That alone was progress: when the United States asked Chinese officials to discuss cybertheft, cyberespionage and cybersecurity at a meeting several years ago, there was almost no give and take. But new attention focused on the activities of the Chinese military, notably Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army, has made it harder for Mr. Xi's government to ignore the United States' protests. Mr. Snowden's revelations may be a gift to the Chinese, because they shift the focus from China's covert activities to Washington's. And even American scholars say the Chinese have a good argument. ''It is not true that 'unwritten rules' prohibit economic espionage,'' said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and cyberexpert who served in the Bush administration. ''Economic espionage is expressly prohibited by U.S. domestic law but is not prohibited by international law, written or unwritten, and it is widely practiced.'' The most fruitful part of the conversations, American officials indicated in a briefing late on Wednesday, dealt with North Korea and climate change, two areas where the governments have been moving into alignment.

New Targets for Hackers: Your Car and Your House,"Imagine driving on the freeway at 60 miles per hour and your car suddenly screeches to a halt, causing a pileup that injures dozens of people. Now imagine you had absolutely nothing to do with the accident because your car was taken over by hackers. Charlie Miller, a security researcher at Twitter, and Chris Valasek, director of security intelligence at IOActive, a security research company, recently demonstrated car hacks at the DefCon computer security conferences in Las Vegas. The researchers completely disabled a driver's ability to control a vehicle. No brakes. Distorted steering. All with a click of a button. While the demos were with hybrid cars, researchers warn that dozens of modern vehicles could be susceptible.  Hackers and security researchers are moving away from simply trying to break into -- or protect -- people's e-mail accounts, stealing credit cards and other dirty digital deeds. Now they're exploring vulnerabilities to break through the high-tech security of homes, cause car accidents or in some extreme cases, kill people who use implanted medical devices. ''Once any single computer in a car is compromised, safety of the vehicle goes out the window,'' Mr. Miller said in an e-mail interview. Modern cars typically have 10 to 40 little computers in them. ''Right now, there aren't a lot of ways for hackers to remotely attack cars: Bluetooth, wireless tire sensors, telematics units,'' he added. ''But as cars get Internet connections, things will get easier for the attacker.'' Carmakers and the government are aware that our vehicles are vulnerable. In fact, Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek received a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, to research ways carmakers can thwart attacks. The biggest fear is the future: as cars become more computerized -- or become fully automated, computers on wheels that drive for you -- they'll become more inviting targets.[Video: A video featuring two hackers showing Forbes's Andy Greenberg their latest tricks with cars. Watch on YouTube.]But the demonstrations by security experts and hackers weren't a peek at what's to come. The researchers hacked a Toyota Prius and Ford Escape, two hybrid cars that are already on the road. Certainly, hackable cars are a troubling development for people who don't even like to use cruise control. Now to add to your paranoia, security researchers warned that our homes are more vulnerable than our cars to attackers. That is, if burglars trade in their lockpicks and crowbars for laptops and Wi-Fi scanners. Devices like the Lockitron, a Wi-Fi enabled front-door lock that can be used with a smartphone, could open a way for technically skilled thieves to break into your home. That's not to pick on Lockitron. They just happen to be on the cutting-edge of wireless home security. ''We've built Lockitron from the ground up with security in mind,'' the company said in a statement, while acknowledging that ''anyone claiming their system is 'unhackable' is wrong.'' At the conferences, security experts lauded the company for the protection it has built into the Lockitron. Hackers could also turn our televisions and webcams against us, monitoring everything we're saying and doing. Next-generation light bulbs that are connected to the Web could be tampered with. Digital refrigerators could be turned off, allowing food to spoil without your knowledge. Some hacks could be mere practical jokes, albeit messy ones. Researchers have warned that the Bluetooth-enabled INAX Satis model toilets, which can be controlled via a smartphone app, could easily be hacked to spray water up instead of down. In response to warnings that its toilets could be hacked, INAX said it issued a security update for its toilets this month. Yes, in the future, you will need to download security updates for your toilet. And then, there are the usual smartphones fears. At BlackHat, Kevin McNamee, the director of Kindsight Security Labs, demonstrated how to take over an Android smartphone by injecting code through the game ''Angry Birds.'' Once he had control of the phone, Mr. McNamee was able to remove photos and personal data from the device without the owner having any clue. Other researchers took over an iPhone by hacking a power adapter -- yes, a little white power cord -- to suck passwords and e-mails from a device that ran operating systems earlier than iOS 7. But some of the most advanced security researchers are thinking about even scarier hacks, of implanted medical devices. Barnaby Jack, who was perhaps best known for a hack that made an A.T.M. spit out cash, was supposed to demonstrate at Black Hat how implantable medical devices, including a pacemaker, can be hacked to kill someone. But Mr. Jack, who was in his 30s, died shortly before he was to make his presentation, of causes that have yet to be determined. He was often referred to as an ''ethical hacker'' and hoped to show the pacemaker exploit as a warning to device makers. So, should we dig holes in our yards, bury our computers and smartphones and never drive our cars again? Some researchers said many of these demonstrations were provocative, but they were more theoretical than any sort of real risk we had to worry about today. ''Sometimes there is a gap between the researcher community and the real world. Researchers bridge this gap often, but it's not uncommon to see conference talks on exotic technologies that don't really impact our everyday lives just yet,'' said Chris Rohlf, founder of Leaf Security Research, a security consulting company, in an interview. ''As technology embeds itself into these everyday devices and other parts of our lives, you will see an increased focus on their security. Anywhere you find technology you'll inevitably find hackers.'' When these technologies do arrive, I would not count on the companies that are installing computers in our cars, homes and bodies to be able to stop rogue hackers. ''We haven't figured out how to stop attacks against Web browsers in personal computers despite trying for the last 10 years, so there isn't any reason to think that we can stop attacks against cars or other devices in the near future,'' Mr. Miller said. ''We should be concerned and start taking action now before something bad happens. I'll still be using my car and refrigerator in the meantime though.''

Times Says Web Site Failure Is Unrelated to Cyberattack,"The Web site of The New York Times was off-line for about two hours on Wednesday in what company officials say was a failure during regular maintenance of NYTimes.com and not the result of a cyberattack.  ''The outage occurred within seconds of a scheduled maintenance update being pushed out, and we believe that was the cause,'' said Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for The New York Times Company. The site went down about 11:10 a.m.. It returned around 1:15 p.m., but service was sporadic. New articles were being published again by about 3 p.m. The failure took place during the peak hours for traffic to the site, between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Ms. Murphy said, adding that the site had more than 7.1 million visits on Monday. In January, The Times reported that Chinese hackers had repeatedly attacked NYTimes.com and had obtained passwords for some reporters and other employees before being repelled by computer experts working for the company. Ms. Murphy said that based on what experts examining the failure on Wednesday had seen, there was ''no reason to believe this was the result of a cyberattack.'' It was a consequential day for international news, with reports that the Egyptian military had fired on protesters supporting the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi, leaving hundreds of people dead. The Times used Facebook Notes to publish a handful of articles, including two concerning the violent crackdown in Egypt. With a let's-put-out-a-newspaper attitude -- for example, the Opinion section of The Times posted to Twitter: ''Readers, don't fret. If NYTimes.com remains down, we are ready to tweet op-eds and editorials in 140-character increments'' -- the failure was reminiscent of a power blackout. As it happens, Wednesday was the 10th anniversary of the East Coast blackout. Others were there to fill the void -- with some promoting their podcasts or articles. Dow Jones sent a message via Twitter about its newspaper, The Wall Street Journal: ''Bonus lunchtime reading: WSJ.com is free to everyone for the next 2 hours.'' The company said the offer was for its breaking news coverage of Egypt, a practice it has followed in the past. For readers, the single biggest opportunity seemed to be the reaction on Twitter. Ezra Klein of The Washington Post posted: ''What, you thought Jeff Bezos was going to buy the Post and play defense?'' "
Times Site Is Disrupted In Attack By Hackers,"The New York Times Web site was unavailable to readers on Tuesday afternoon after an online attack on the company's domain name registrar. The attack also forced employees of The Times to take care in sending e-mails. The hacking was just the latest of a major media organization, with The Financial Times and The Washington Post also having their operations disrupted within the last few months. It was also the second time this month that the Web site of The New York Times was unavailable for several hours.  Marc Frons, chief information officer for The New York Times Company, issued a statement at 4:20 p.m. on Tuesday warning employees that the disruption -- which appeared to be affecting the Web site well into the evening -- was ''the result of a malicious external attack.'' He advised employees to ''be careful when sending e-mail communications until this situation is resolved.'' In an interview, Mr. Frons said the attack was carried out by a group known as ''the Syrian Electronic Army, or someone trying very hard to be them.'' The group attacked the company's domain name registrar, Melbourne IT. The Web site first went down after 3 p.m.; once service was restored, the hackers quickly disrupted the site again. Shortly after 6 p.m., Mr. Frons said that ''we believe that we are on the road to fixing the problem.'' The Syrian Electronic Army is a group of hackers who support President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Matt Johansen, head of the Threat Research Center at White Hat Security, posted on Twitter that he was directed to a Syrian Web domain when he tried to view The Times's Web site. Until now, The Times has been spared from being hacked by the S.E.A., but on Aug. 15, the group attacked The Washington Post's Web site through a third-party service provided by a company called Outbrain. At the time, the S.E.A. also tried to hack CNN. Just a day earlier, The Times's Web site was down for several hours. The Times cited technical problems and said there was no indication the site had been hacked. The S.E.A. first emerged in May 2011, during the first Syrian uprisings, when it started attacking a wide array of media outlets and nonprofits and spamming popular Facebook pages like President Obama's and Oprah Winfrey's with pro-Assad comments. Their goal, they said, was to offer a pro-government counternarrative to media coverage of Syria. The group, which also disrupted The Financial Times in May, has consistently denied ties to the government and has said it does not target Syrian dissidents, but security researchers and Syrian rebels say they are not convinced. They say the group is the outward-facing campaign of a much quieter surveillance campaign focused on Syrian dissidents and are quick to point out that Mr. Assad once referred to the S.E.A. as ''a real army in a virtual reality.'' In a post on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon, the S.E.A. also said it had hacked the administrative contact information for Twitter's domain name registry records. According to Whois.com, the S.E.A. was listed on the entries for Twitter's administrative name, technical name and e-mail address. Twitter said that at 4:49 p.m., the domain name records for one image server, twimg.com, were modified, affecting the viewing of images and photos for some users. By 6:29 p.m. the company said, it had regained control, although as of early evening, some users were still reporting problems receiving images. The social networking company, based in San Francisco, said no user information had been affected. Mr. Frons said the attacks on Twitter and The New York Times required significantly more skill than the string of S.E.A. attacks on media outlets earlier this year, when the group attacked Twitter accounts for dozens of outlets including The Associated Press. Those attacks caused the stock market to plunge after the group planted false tales of explosions at the White House. ''In terms of the sophistication of the attack, this is a big deal,'' Mr. Frons said. ''It's sort of like breaking into the local savings and loan versus breaking into Fort Knox. A domain registrar should have extremely tight security because they are holding the security to hundreds if not thousands of Web sites.'' "
Imagining a Cyberattack on the Power Grid,"WASHINGTON -- It's electrifying. Iran and Venezuela want to destroy the United States, so they conspire with a rogue Russian spy to launch a cyberattack on the North American power grid, beginning by electrocuting a lineman in North Dakota. Their main obstacle is a small-town sheriff in the state's badlands, Nate Osborne, a former Marine Corps lieutenant in Afghanistan whose titanium leg ultimately saves the day. That is more or less the plot of ''Gridlock,'' co-written by former Senator Byron L. Dorgan, the latest offering in a peculiar Washington genre.  ''That's my little niche, North Dakota energy thriller,'' said Mr. Dorgan, a Democrat who represented North Dakota in the Senate and House for more than three decades. But life is increasingly imitating Mr. Dorgan's potboiler. More than 200 utilities and government agencies across the country, from Consolidated Edison to the Department of Homeland Security to Verizon, are now expected to sign up for the largest emergency drill to test the electricity sector's preparation for cyberattack. The drill, scheduled for November, will simulate an attack by an adversary that takes down large sections of the power grid and knocks out vast areas of the continent for weeks. The drill, organized by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, is to explore how the country would respond to an enormous grid failure that interrupts supplies of water, food and fuel and creates disruptions on a scale far beyond those of Sept. 11, 2001. Although it's potentially bad news for the country, it's good news for Mr. Dorgan, who has been on an episodic book tour since ''Gridlock,'' written with David Hagberg, was published in July. ''It's entertaining, it's a thriller, but I hope it will get people to think about this some,'' Mr. Dorgan said in a recent interview in his office at a Washington law firm overlooking K Street, the lobbyists' corridor, and decorated with photos of himself with assorted presidents. An attack on the grid could really happen, Mr. Dorgan said. ''I think that we are vulnerable, and it's not just me, it's the National Science Foundation and a number of people in the energy industry. 'Glass jaw' is a pretty good description of the grid system, honestly.'' The book is a sequel to Mr. Dorgan and Mr. Hagberg's first energy thriller, ''Blowout,'' in which Iran and Venezuela link up with shady hedge-fund types to destroy a supersecret project that uses microbes to turn North Dakota coal into limitless, low-pollution electricity. In both books, many bad guys die, along with a few good ones, but enough survive to preserve the possibility of yet another sequel. Plots vary, but the characters are drawn from a familiar inventory of types, and the story lines have a certain predictability. They read a bit like treatments for action movies, the kind without much heavy dialogue. ''I know they're not Shakespeare,'' said Mr. Hagberg, who said he had written more than 80 novels under his own name and several pseudonyms. Mr. Dorgan is not completely new to writing either, although his previous offerings have been nonfiction. ''Take This Job and Ship It: How Corporate Greed and Brain-Dead Politics Are Selling Out America,'' was published in 2006, and ''Reckless!,'' on the perils of banking deregulation, was in print three years later. Out of the blue, his agent came to him with an idea for fiction, and the notion that in a novel, ''you can put important things into the public consciousness.'' A prominent local bookseller, Bradley Graham of Politics & Prose bookstore, put it slightly differently: Former spies and military officers often spin tales out of their experience, so why not legislators? In Mr. Dorgan's case, it would be a former appropriator, since he headed a subcommittee in charge of energy spending. The two-book collaboration got a boost, said Mr. Hagberg, because his publisher, Forge, which specializes in action titles, was ''keen on more environmental stuff.'' Mr. Dorgan brought local color to both ''Gridlock'' and ''Blowout.'' The North Dakota characters, for example, make fun of characters from South Dakota. (''What does he know, he's from South Dakota,'' one says to another.) Mr. Dorgan also contributed his knowledge of Washington's energy bureaucracy and the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or Arpa-e, a new organization that finances high-risk energy projects and is modeled after the better-known Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa. In ''Gridlock,'' Arpa-e has provided the money for a top-secret Dakota District Initiative, modeled after the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. The idea of giant secret projects are more fiction than readers may recognize. The real Arpa-e puts small sums into dozens of start-ups, and then publicizes the investments. Mr. Dorgan, 71, said he got the idea of microbes that turn coal into natural gas from Craig Venter, the biologist who was one of the first to sequence the human genome. (Mr. Ventor had a contract with Exxon to research making oil from algae.) Mr. Dorgan said he started his first book, ''Take This Job and Ship It,'' on a cruise with his extended family, using a 24-page guide to writing a book proposal that he found on the Internet. For the two thrillers, his agent paired him with Mr. Hagberg. (Mr. Hagberg, whose red-white-and-blue heroes tend toward conservative military or small-town types, described himself as a ''raging Republican,'' and called Mr. Dorgan ''my token Democrat.'') Mr. Dorgan and Mr. Hagberg would not discuss how ''Gridlock'' and ''Blowout'' were selling, although on Tuesday ''Gridlock'' was No. 94,180 on Amazon. Putting the name of a recently retired senator on the cover of a book does not make it sell any better, Mr. Hagberg said. "
"Both Hero and Villain, and Irresistible","Before there was a documentary about WikiLeaks -- before there was a major motion picture about its founder -- Julian Assange was a star. With his mysterious hacker back story and shock of silver hair, Mr. Assange burst into public consciousness in 2010 with WikiLeaks' release of the Apache helicopter attack video and, in the process of revealing millions of secrets, unlocked a rarefied kind of fame. An unfolding tale of a swashbuckling avatar against powerful forces was a movie trailer waiting to happen. The mythmaking was under way long before the spring release of ''We Steal Secrets,'' the documentary directed by Alex Gibney, and well in advance of the buildup to ''The Fifth Estate,'' the Bill Condon movie due Oct. 18, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Mr. Assange. The WikiLeaks-Assange story has snaked through countless twists and turns that played out on multiple platforms all over the world, scanning as a movie that has unfurled in real time. In that sense, the first film about WikiLeaks is the one that happened right in front of our eyes, one that left governments scrambling, media organizations gasping and regular people guessing about his next move.  Given its high profile and cinematic elements, the WikiLeaks tale was catnip to the movie industry. At one time, there were five films about Mr. Assange in development, with the documentary and the new drama eventually winning the race and going into production. The movies, each directed by an Academy Award winner, have sparked enormous discussion and remarkable pushback from WikiLeaks and its supporters. It is a measure of our times, and perhaps Mr. Assange's appetite for renown, that a technology designed to enable anonymity for whistle-blowers became an engine of celebrity. He is, even absent the attentions of Hollywood, one of the more recognizable faces on earth. It helps that he inhabits the role of provocateur so well. Mr. Assange is Australian by birth, but his accent is transnational, reinforcing the impression that he is a new kind of human, a product of the Internet who lives on the digital grid and in our collective consciousness. But he wears white and black hats with equal ease. His critics say he has behaved carelessly, some say recklessly, a view of Mr. Assange that gained traction after he was sought for questioning about accusations of sexual assault in Sweden. Handsome, dashing, conflicted and pursued, Mr. Assange is a kind of freelance spy who engages in black ops against powerful multinational interests. How different really is that from every Bourne movie you've ever seen? Sure, the damage he inflicts is with a flick of the mouse rather than a fusillade of gunfire, but his credentials as international man of intrigue are unassailable. And the fact that the peripatetic globe-trotter is now walled in by the Ecuadorean Embassy in London is a remarkably paradoxical third act. ''Even while he is attacking our movie, you can't help but feel how vulnerable he is in this moment,'' Mr. Condon said, adding that Mr. Assange was ''stuck in a self-imposed cell, and there is something deeply tragic about that.'' Mr. Gibney said that Mr. Assange expresses, and for some people fulfills, a durable human impulse. ''People desperately need and want a hero, and here you have someone who can set up a computer and instantly be inside the neural pathways of the entire Web,'' Mr. Gibney said. ''It's pretty hard to resist the story of a guy roaming the world armed with nothing more than his laptop.'' In both ''The Fifth Estate'' and ''We Steal Secrets,'' technology is a persistent character. In the same way that ''The Insider'' (1999) seemed to make reporters out to be action figures with weaponized cellphones -- remember Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman whipping out a clunky cellphone as if it were an AK-47? -- ''The Fifth Estate'' is rife with scenes of Mr. Assange rushing into a room and snapping open his computer with a flourish. Laptops never looked so sexy or powerful, and the WikiLeaks story often seems like a sequel to ''Revenge of the Nerds'' writ large. By trying to stop the government's digital bots from taking over our lives, Mr. Assange would seem to be fighting on behalf of all mankind. He is Tom Cruise in ''Minority Report,'' Harrison Ford in ''Blade Runner'' and Matt Damon in ''Elysium.'' But Mr. Assange also echoes a less modern cinematic type, the lone wolves of paranoid '70s cinema. As a man on the run, he brings to mind the C.I.A. analyst Robert Redford played in ''3 Days of the Condor'' or the reeling Dustin Hoffman being chased through ''Marathon Man.'' You can go even further back and find an analogue in Frank Sinatra in ''The Manchurian Candidate.'' Then again, Mr. Assange is fond of saying he will crush an opponent ''like a bug.'' Through that prism, he is closer to a Bond villain -- stateless, vaguely Euro-ish, with stunt hair and a remarkably cool demeanor. But to understand the appeal of a character like Mr. Assange in the current cultural context, the small screen might be a better place to look. He is an outlaw who lives by his own code, as was Tony Soprano, but his closest counterpart is probably Carrie Mathison, the C.I.A. operative on ''Homeland,'' skilled and omniscient but with a messianic zeal that tends to create a great deal of collateral damage. On the big screen, the two movies cast Mr. Assange as a tragic and self-seeking figure, a leader of a cause that conflated his personal interests and the movement's. Perhaps no one could shoulder the scrutiny that Mr. Assange has lived through, but he does not play the game of making nice with the media. As I have written before, I once had lunch with Mr. Assange in the English countryside, and while he was enormously gracious, fun even, in showing me and my family around the farm where he was under house arrest, he was also reflexively provocative, somewhat hilariously insulting me and the place I work for. In Mr. Assange's paranoid worldview, large, multinational financial interests have had a secret handshake with governments, principally that of the United States, and have together prosecuted a war on privacy, freedom and economic fairness. The reason that paranoia is so appealing? He turned out to be mostly right. Every time you open up a news site, the government seems to get its hands farther and farther up your skirt. In that sense, we are not just the audience in these movies; we are part of a target-rich environment, and so we root Mr. Assange on in spite of his shortcomings. Mr. Assange has made it clear that he hates both films, which comes as no surprise from a man who sees agendas and lies everywhere he looks. Mr. Gibney's film may be a work of journalism, but its rise-and-fall narrative did not sit well with its subject. WikiLeaks put out an annotation of a partial script that takes issue with practically everything in the film, beginning with the title, which is described as ''irresponsible libel.'' The memo adds, ''Not even critics in the film say that WikiLeaks steals secrets.'' Mr. Gibney is accused of selective editing, underappreciating the historic nature of the organization's work and rendering Chelsea Manning (previously known as Pfc. Bradley Manning) as a caricature, among many, many other complaints. Mr. Gibney, who has gone after many of the same targets that WikiLeaks has taken on, found himself dealing with incoming from its allies in the press and elsewhere. Chris Hedges, a former reporter for The New York Times who now blogs at TruthDig.com, accused him of making a work of ''agitprop for the security and surveillance state,'' intended to marginalize WikiLeaks and Mr. Assange. Mr. Gibney said he followed the facts and told the story they revealed, nothing more. ''The degree of vitriol has been amazing,'' Mr. Gibney said. ''He is a remarkable figure, narcissistic in the extreme and, as they say, beautiful from afar, but far from beautiful.'' Predictably, a work of drama purporting to depict real events has already picked up a great deal of withering reaction from Mr. Assange and his supporters. In a quotation sent by a WikiLeaks staff member -- Mr. Assange is, as behooves a star of his magnitude, surrounded by layers and difficult to access -- he suggested that ''The Fifth Estate,'' apart from being wrong about himself and WikiLeaks, is doomed commercially. ''Most people love our work and its ongoing David versus Goliath struggle,'' he said. ''These people form the backbone of the WikiLeaks cinema market. But rather than cater to this market, DreamWorks decided to cater to other interests. The result is a reactionary snoozefest that only the U.S. government could love. As a result the film has no audience and no promotion community. It will flop at the box office and deservedly so.'' In an e-mail, Kristinn Hrafnsson, a WikiLeaks spokesman, said, ''I don't recognize the Julian in these films, nor the fundamental essence of what we are doing.'' In a phone call, Mr. Condon made it clear he was proud of his film. A narrative feature requires license to pack vast amounts of history into a commercially viable length, and Mr. Condon said the film is true to its subject, including its depiction of his alleged hypocrisy around organizational information and WikiLeaks. ''For a public figure, he is one of the most thin-skinned subjects I have ever seen,'' Mr. Condon said. ''He believes and advocates for transparency, except where he is concerned. He doesn't realize it, but he has become the consummate tragic hero who sowed the seeds of his own demise.'' The chronic, multifront war is a fact of life at the off-screen version of WikiLeaks. Even people at odds with Mr. Assange don't deny him his place in history. ''Julian was able to pull together the biggest news organizations on earth and get them to cooperate around a single leak, holding the story for three weeks,'' said James Ball, a former WikiLeaks associate who now works at The Guardian. ''That is an amazing feat.'' That Mr. Assange ended up in a dispute with Mr. Ball, his media partners and just about everyone else around him adds to the myth. What is he against? Whatever comes his way. ''Most people avoid confrontation, but Julian escalates every single time,'' Mr. Ball said. ''He has the guts, the arrogance and the insanity to take everyone on. I think part of the reason that there is so much interest in WikiLeaks is that people respond to that.'' Many of the great public debates show up in the movie house, so it should not be surprising to see a simulacrum of Mr. Assange on the big screen. And it's even less surprising that the nature of what is on the screen is the beginning of yet another debate. History, in this instance, refuses to sit still. The first draft is a Web document, subject to endless annotation. "
Politicians' Extortion Racket,"Peter Schweizer, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, is the author of ''Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes and Line Their Own Pockets.'' TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- WE have long assumed that the infestation of special interest money in Washington is at the root of so much that ails our politics. But what if we've had it wrong? What if instead of being bribed by wealthy interests, politicians are engaged in a form of legal extortion designed to extract campaign contributions? Consider this: of the thousands of bills introduced in Congress each year, only roughly 5 percent become law. Why do legislators bother proposing so many bills? What if many of those bills are written not to be passed but to pressure people into forking over cash?  This is exactly what is happening. Politicians have developed a dizzying array of legislative tactics to bring in money. Take the maneuver known inside the Beltway as the ''tollbooth.'' Here the speaker of the House or a powerful committee chairperson will create a procedural obstruction or postponement on the eve of an important vote. Campaign contributions are then implicitly solicited. If the tribute offered by those in favor of the bill's passage is too small (or if the money from opponents is sufficiently high), the bill is delayed and does not proceed down the legislative highway. House Speaker John A. Boehner appears to be a master of the tollbooth. In 2011, he collected a total of over $200,000 in donations from executives and companies in the days before holding votes on just three bills. He delayed scheduling a vote for months on the widely supported Wireless Tax Fairness Act, and after he finally announced a vote, 37 checks from wireless-industry executives totaling nearly $40,000 rolled in. He also delayed votes on the Access to Capital for Job Creators Act and the Small Company Capital Formation Act, scoring $91,000 from investment banks and private equity firms, $32,450 from bank holding companies and $46,500 from self-described investors -- all in the 48 hours between scheduling the vote and the vote's actually being held on the House floor. Another tactic that politicians use is something beltway insiders call ''milker bills.'' These are bills designed to ''milk'' donations from threatened individuals or businesses. The real trick is to pit two industries against each other and pump both for donations, thereby creating a ''double milker'' bill. President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. seemed to score big in 2011 using the milker tactic in connection with two bills: the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act. By pitting their supporters in Silicon Valley who opposed the bills against their allies in Hollywood who supported the measures, Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden were able to create a sort of fund-raising arms race. In the first half of 2011, Silicon Valley had chipped in only $1.7 million to Mr. Obama's political campaign. The president announced that he would ''probably'' sign antipiracy legislation -- a stance that pleased Hollywood and incensed Silicon Valley. The tech industry then poured millions into Mr. Obama's coffers in the second half of 2011. By January of 2012, Hollywood had donated $4.1 million to Mr. Obama. Then, suddenly, on Jan. 14, 2012, the White House announced that it had problems with the antipiracy bills and neither passed. ''He didn't just throw us under the bus,'' one film executive and longtime supporter of Mr. Obama anonymously told The Financial Times, ''he ran us down, reversed the bus and ran over us again.'' To be sure, not all legislative maneuvers are extortive; sincere and conscientious political deeds occur. Still, the idea that Washington gridlock is an outgrowth of rank partisanship and ideological entrenchment misses a more compelling explanation of our political stasis: gridlock, legislative threats and fear help prime the donation pump. The reason these fund-raising extortion tactics succeed is that politicians deploy them while bills are making their way through Congress, when lawmakers possess maximum leverage. That's why at least 27 state legislatures have put restrictions on allowing state politicians to receive contributions while their legislatures are in session. Why not do the same in Washington? It would reduce politicians' penchant for cashing in on manufactured crises. Perhaps it would even compel Congress to be more efficient while in session. We have focused for too long on protecting politicians from special interests. It's time we stop pitying the poor politicians and start being wary of them -- for they play the shakedown game as well as anyone. "
Invitation to a Dialogue: Bring Back Civility,"To the Editor: The tragic news last month about another teenage victim of cyberbullying and the chillingly remorseless comments attributed last week to one of her alleged cyberstalkers (''Felony Counts for 2 in Suicide of Bullied 12-Year-Old,'' news article, Oct. 16) must serve as more than just another reminder for parents and teachers to monitor online chatter. The episode exemplifies how we as a culture -- from children to adults, in both public and private -- have grown coarser and cruder in tone. In many respects, our nation has ruptured with civility.  It's not that human nature has changed; we have simply become more transparent. The advent of digital communication has allowed us to engage in consequence-free hostility -- when facial reactions and emotional responses are placed at a remove. Hostile messaging, abrupt e-mails, and caustic online posts and reviews have normalized an uglier and less empathic side of human behavior -- and colored our politics and entertainment as well. Witness the humiliations routinely showcased on reality TV, the snarls of call-in shows and the acidic tone of popular blogs. We are not built to like everyone, but we are built to behave civilly. We need to reinforce this message in schools, homes and sports programs, and within the worlds of digital culture and commerce. Teenagers -- and adults -- must be called out on excessive sarcasm, bilious remarks, soft bullying and anything that denigrates another individual. Humiliation is not entertainment. Whether it's a shock jock, a coarse reality-TV show, an obnoxious song or a shout-fest on political TV: turn it off. On a corporate level, applause is due to Web sites that have stopped accepting anonymous comments. This should extend to customer reviews. Nothing encourages hateful remarks more than anonymity. Dislike is natural; disdain is not. If we do not each, by our own private lights, devise ways to alter the tone of day-to-day life, the legacy we pass on to the next generation is of a coarsened and crippled manner of interacting.

"In Spy Uproar, 'Everyone Does It' Just Won't Do","WASHINGTON -- The angry protests from Germany's chancellor over the National Security Agency's monitoring of her cellphone and France's furor over the collection of data about millions of its citizens have obscured a new reality: The digital age has merely expanded the ability of nations to do to one another what they have done for centuries. But at the same time, it has allowed the Europeans, the Chinese and other powers to replicate N.S.A. techniques. France has long been considered one of the most talented powers at stealing industrial secrets and intellectual property, intelligence officials say, although in recent years it has been pushed to the sidelines by the Chinese. Their daily cyberattacks have worked their way into the Pentagon and gotten them the blueprints for the F-35, the most expensive fighter jet in history.  The Russians have a reputation in the intelligence community for taking their time to infiltrate specific communications targets. ''They are a lot more patient than the Chinese,'' one former American intelligence official said recently, ''and so they don't get caught as often.'' The Israelis are well known for cooperating with the United States on major intelligence targets, mostly Iran, while using a combination of old-fashioned spies and sophisticated electronic techniques to decipher Washington's internal debates, the officials say. Long before Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany waved a new, encrypted cellphone at reporters on Thursday in Brussels -- a way to foil the N.S.A., the German leader suggested, although maybe it arrived in her hand a little late -- President Obama got an early primer on how vulnerable national leaders are to espionage of all sorts. Fresh from the discovery that Chinese hackers had broken into the computer systems used by his 2008 campaign, he waged a bureaucratic war to hold on to his BlackBerry. In the end, he won a partial victory when he was issued a National Security Agency-approved, heavily encrypted model, with his communications limited to a small number of advisers and old friends. (He may lose it, some officials say, if the Chinese-owned computer maker Lenovo buys the BlackBerry brand from its hemorrhaging Canadian manufacturer.) While it is tempting to dismiss the latest revelations with an everyone-does-it shrug, American officials now concede that the uproar in Europe about the N.S.A.'s programs -- both the popular outrage and a more calculated political response by Ms. Merkel and France's president, François Hollande -- may have a broader diplomatic and economic effect than they first imagined. In Washington, the reaction has set off a debate over whether it is time to put the brakes on the N.S.A., whose capabilities, Mr. Obama has hinted, have expanded faster than its judgment. There are now two groups looking at the N.S.A.'s activities: one inside the National Security Council, another with outside advisers. The president all but told Ms. Merkel that ''we don't have the balance right,'' according to one official. ''Sure, everyone does it, but that's been an N.S.A. excuse for too long,'' one former senior official who talks to Mr. Obama often on intelligence matters said Friday. ''Obama has said, publicly and privately, that just because we can do something doesn't mean we should do it. But everyone has moved too slowly in moving that from a slogan to a policy.'' Diplomats at the United Nations on Friday said that Germany and Brazil, two of the countries whose leaders have been subjected to N.S.A. invasions of their communications, were drafting a General Assembly resolution that would seek to strengthen Internet privacy. The diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the drafting is still in the early stages, said momentum for the measure, begun in the summer, had been invigorated by the most recent disclosures of American eavesdropping. A formal resolution could be ready for consideration next month in what would be the first internationally coordinated response to the N.S.A. spying. Word of the German-Brazilian initiative was first reported on the Web site of Foreign Policy. In Europe, where Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande demanded Friday that the United States open negotiations on a ''code of conduct'' that would limit surveillance, there is a sense that the steady stream of revelations may give them an upper hand. Ms. Merkel keeps repeating the phrase that the Americans must ''restore trust.'' One way the French and Germans intend to do that is to seek some form of inclusion in the inner circle of American intelligence allies, or at least for a deeper intelligence alliance. Right now that inner circle, called the ''Five Eyes,'' consists of the United States and four English-speaking partners: Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Those partners agree not to spy on one another and to share in many of the United States' deepest intelligence secrets, as the trove of highly classified documents made public by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, makes clear. But Europe's demands may go further than a stronger spying relationship with the United States. The European Union wants to require American companies, led by Internet powerhouses like Google and Yahoo, to get the approval of European officials before complying with warrants issued in the United States seeking information, e-mails or search histories about European citizens. The European Union would slap the technology companies with huge fines if they failed to agree to those rules, meaning that the companies would be caught between two masters and several legal systems. Those kinds of demands would have been hard to imagine during the cold war, when European nations relied on the United States for protection from the Soviet Union, and American spying and rule-setting were tolerated. ''We had more cushion then,'' said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who as a diplomat worked for several American presidents on the unification of Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. ''This is all part of a larger distancing of the U.S. by the Europeans,'' he said, one in which traditional allies cannot agree on rules for spying and rules for governing the Internet. Viewed that way, the tapping of Ms. Merkel's phone was something of a remnant of a previous era. The tapping in fact appears to have begun roughly a decade ago, during the George W. Bush administration. Yet it is unclear what motivated the Bush administration to monitor her cellphone -- she appears to have at least two, and the target apparently was her personal one -- or why Mr. Obama seemed unaware that it was happening, even five years into his presidency. (His national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, assured her German counterpart that the president knew nothing about it, even while refusing to confirm that it happened.) Mr. Obama, like his predecessors, argues that the United States taps phones and hacks into computers only to protect the world, not to gain commercial advantage. But no one in the government has admitted that the N.S.A. has been spying on Ms. Merkel, or the Mexican president, or the Brazilians, much less explained why. One thing is clear: The N.S.A.'s cold-war-era argument, that everyone does it, seems unlikely to win the day. "
Fear of the Dark,"An energy and environment reporter for The New York Times. TWO years ago, the first time the government and the utility industry held an emergency drill to simulate a cyberattack on the nation's power grid, 75 agencies and utilities showed up. For a second drill next week, organizers are expecting more than 200. But it is not just the utility industry and the government that are increasingly concerned about threats to the grid. The widespread failures caused by Hurricane Sandy last year are still fresh in the minds of many Americans -- especially those on the East Coast. ''In areas of the country where hurricanes are not terribly frequent, like New York,'' said Jay Apt, the executive director of the Electricity Industry Center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, ''it is a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence, and that makes a big impression on folks.''  Energy in general is something people like to worry about, said Mr. Apt, and grid failure is the latest target of that anxiety. ''It echoes the 'peak oil' theme,'' he said, referring to the alarmist concern, especially before the advent of fracking, that oil supplies had peaked and were about to shrink, with catastrophic results. The idea of a sustained blackout resonates in the public's mind, agreed David Ropeik, an expert on risk perception, particularly because it could come from either cyberattack, physical attack by terrorists or even Mother Nature as a side effect of solar flares. ''It is one of those low-probability, high-consequence events that every once in awhile scares the bejesus out of us,'' he said. Grid failure, he added, is ''the risk du jour.'' It sure seems that way, given the rising chatter on the web, radio talk shows and in popular media. In a made-for-TV movie, ''American Blackout,'' broadcast late last month by National Geographic, hackers bring down the power grid for 10 days and the country descends into ''Lord of the Flies'' savagery. NBC's hit post-apocalyptic series ''Revolution'' is set in America 15 years after the lights have gone out all over the world, and Hollywood has also dabbled with grid angst as a plot device, notably with the 2007 Bruce Willis movie ''Live Free or Die Hard.'' In the recent novel ''Gridlock,'' Byron L. Dorgan, a former senator from North Dakota, and his co-author, David Hagberg, spin a tale of a rogue Russian agent recruited by Iran and Venezuela to hire an anarchist hacker to bring down the grid in a harrowing series of rolling blackouts. And in William R. Forstchen's 2009 novel, ''One Second After,'' bad guys cripple the grid with three small nuclear explosions in the upper atmosphere. A couple of broader forces may be helping to stoke the growing awareness of grid vulnerability. For one thing, the 2009 stimulus package pumped billions of dollars into ''smart meters,'' so many Americans now realize that their electric meters, formerly boring gray metal boxes clamped to the side of the house, are essentially computers that can backfire on them if hacked. And as more and more people see their email accounts, credit cards and even their identities hijacked, they can imagine what else hackers are capable of doing. Officials involved in next week's drill, called GridEx II, won't say much about it in advance, because they don't want to tip off the participants, and may not say much after, either, because if the test is any good some players will fail, and they don't want them to be publicly embarrassed. Even so, Brian M. Harrell, the associate director of Critical Infrastructure Protection at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which is holding the drill, promised simulations of ''denial of service attacks,'' in which hackers flood a computer with messages and overwhelm it, as well as ''some coordinated physical attacks against key transmission substations and generating facilities,'' including bombings and ''an active shooter scenario.'' (Nobody's lights will go out, he promised.) Real life, at least so far, has been a bit tamer, but still dramatic. Bad software and bad management blacked out 50 million people from Detroit to New York City in August 2003, in an event so complicated it took engineers weeks to reconstruct what had happened. Technician error in Arizona in September 2011 blacked out seven million people in California. And Hurricane Sandy destroyed power lines and blacked out about 20 million people, many for more than a week. The federal government has instituted reliability rules -- with fines for violations -- on all parties on the grid and has begun talks with utility executives about how government can help recovery efforts after storms or other big events. But because the nation's grid has about 600 separate owners, and their computers are heavily interconnected with links that can carry both good data and malicious code, 100 percent protection against cyberattack is unlikely. How will the public ever know that the system is adequately protected against cyberattack? For that matter, how will the industry itself know? For the moment, those questions are something to worry about. "
Hacker Receives 10-Year Sentence for 'Causing Mayhem',"A federal judge in New York on Friday delivered a 10-year prison sentence to Jeremy Hammond , a prominent member of the hacking group Anonymous who pleaded guilty earlier this year to breaking into the computer servers of a string of corporations, government agencies and law enforcement advocacy groups. Before being sentenced inside a packed courthouse in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Hammond, 28, described his hacking activities as ""acts of civil disobedience"" against both an expanding surveillance state and the companies that do the government's bidding. His lawyers said their client was part of a proud tradition of protest in the United States, dating back to the American Revolution.  But Federal District Judge Loretta A. Preska was unmoved, telling Mr. Hammond ""there's nothing high-minded or public-spirited about causing mayhem."" ""These are not the actions of Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, John Adams or even Daniel Ellsberg,"" she said, referring to the former analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers to several news organizations. Mr. Ellsberg had written a letter to the court praising Mr. Hammond's hacking campaign. Judge Preska's sentence was the exact length of time requested by federal prosecutors in the case, and she said her decision was influenced in part by his ""unrepentant recidivism."" He was convicted and jailed for similar activities in 2006. Mr. Hammond was a prominent member both of Anonymous and LulzSec, a splinter group that claimed credit for hacks on a range of targets, including the website of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Hammond's most highly publicized hack came in late 2011, when he orchestrated the computer sabotage of Stratfor, a private intelligence firm based in Austin, Tex. According to prosecutors, Mr. Hammond stole at least 200 gigabytes of information from Stratfor's computer servers, including the emails and account information of approximately 860,000 of the company's clients. Documents filed by government said that associates of Mr. Hammond used tens of thousands of credit card numbers taken from Stratfor's servers to make at least $700,000 worth of donations to nonprofit groups. Mr. Hammond and several other hackers were arrested based on information from another prominent member of Anonymous, Hector Xavier Monsegur, whom the FBI had turned into a government informant. It was Mr. Monsegur, known within Anonymous by his pseudonym, Sabu, who encouraged Mr. Hammond to break into Stratfor's servers. On Friday, Mr. Hammond said that Mr. Monsegur had also pushed him to expand his hacking targets to include numerous foreign government websites, including those of Iran, Turkey and Brazil. On Friday, Mr. Hammond described Stratfor as a ""deserving target,"" an organization engaged in ""intrusive and possibly illegal surveillance activities on behalf of large multinational corporations."" Both he and his lawyers framed his actions as noble efforts to bring greater transparency to a rapidly growing and largely unaccountable private intelligence industry. Dressed in two T-shirts and baggy pants, Mr. Hammond at one point stood at a podium at the front of the courtroom, speaking directly to Judge Preska. He said he had been inspired by Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Pfc. Bradley Manning, the soldier who gave hundreds of thousands of American diplomatic cables and military records to WikiLeaks. ""If Chelsea Manning fell into the abysmal nightmare of prison fighting for the truth, could I in good conscience do any less, if I was able?"" he said. But at the end of the hearing, Judge Preska said that Mr. Hammond had caused ""widespread harm"" beyond his intended targets. Among other things, she said, his 2011 attack on the computer system of the Arizona Department of Public Safety had disrupted the state's sex offender website and Arizona's Amber Alert System, which broadcasts messages about abducted children. There were audible gasps when the judge handed down the 10-year sentence, and some of those who came to support Mr. Hammond began sobbing. Mr. Hammond showed little emotion when the sentence was delivered, but as he was escorted out of the courtroom he turned around and delivered a message to his supporters. ""Long Live Anonymous!"" he said, one fist pumped in the air. ""Hurrah for anarchy!""  "
Obama is Urged to Sharply Curb N.S.A. Data Mining,"WASHINGTON -- A panel of outside advisers urged President Obama on Wednesday to impose major oversight and some restrictions on the National Security Agency, arguing that in the past dozen years its powers had been enhanced at the expense of personal privacy. The panel recommended changes in the way the agency collects the telephone data of Americans, spies on foreign leaders and prepares for cyberattacks abroad. But the most significant recommendation of the panel of five intelligence and legal experts was that Mr. Obama restructure a program in which the N.S.A. systematically collects logs of all American phone calls -- so-called metadata -- and a small group of agency officials have the power to authorize the search of an individual's telephone contacts. Instead, the panel said, the data should remain in the hands of telecommunications companies or a private consortium, and a court order should be necessary each time analysts want to access the information of any individual ''for queries and data mining.'' The experts briefed Mr. Obama on Wednesday on their 46 recommendations, and a senior administration official said Mr. Obama was ''open to many'' of the changes, though he has already rejected one that called for separate leaders for the N.S.A. and its Pentagon cousin, the United States Cyber Command.  If Mr. Obama adopts the majority of the recommendations, it would mark the first major restrictions on the unilateral powers that the N.S.A. has acquired since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. They would require far more specific approvals from the courts, far more oversight from the Congress and specific presidential approval for spying on national leaders, especially allies. The agency would also have to give up one of its most potent weapons in cyberconflicts: the ability to insert ''back doors'' in American hardware or software, a secret way into them to manipulate computers, or to purchase previously unknown flaws in software that it can use to conduct cyberattacks. ''We have identified a series of reforms that are designed to safeguard the privacy and dignity of American citizens, and to promote public trust, while also allowing the intelligence community to do what must be done to respond to genuine threats,'' says the report, which Mr. Obama commissioned in August in response to the mounting furor over revelations by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor, of the agency's surveillance practices. It adds, ''Free nations must protect themselves, and nations that protect themselves must remain free.'' White House officials said they expected significant resistance to some of the report's conclusions from the N.S.A. and other intelligence agencies, which have argued that imposing rules that could slow the search for terror suspects could pave the way for another attack. But those intelligence leaders were not present in the Situation Room on Wednesday when Mr. Obama met the authors of the report. The report's authors made clear that they were weighing the N.S.A.'s surveillance requirements against other priorities like constitutional protections for privacy and economic considerations for American businesses. The report came just three days after a federal judge in Washington ruled that the bulk collection of telephone data by the government was ''almost Orwellian'' and a day after Silicon Valley executives complained to Mr. Obama that the N.S.A. programs were undermining American competitiveness in offering cloud services or selling American-made hardware, which is now viewed as tainted. The report was praised by privacy advocates in Congress and civil-liberties groups as a surprisingly aggressive call for reform. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who has been an outspoken critic of N.S.A. surveillance, said it echoed the arguments of the N.S.A.'s skeptics in significant ways, noting that it flatly declared that the phone-logging program had not been necessary in stopping terrorist attacks. ''This has been a big week for the cause of intelligence reform,'' he said. Greg Nojeim of the Center for Democracy and Technology called the report ''remarkably strong,'' and singled out its call to sharply limit the F.B.I.'s power to obtain business records about someone through a so-called national security letter, which does not involve court oversight. Anthony Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, while praising the report's recommendations, questioned ''whether the president will have the courage to implement the changes.'' Members of the advisory group said some of the recommendations were intended to provide greater public reassurances about privacy protections rather than to result in any wholesale dismantling of the N.S.A.'s surveillance powers. Richard A. Clarke, a cyberexpert and former national security official under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the report would give ''more reason for the skeptics in the public to believe their civil liberties are being protected.'' Other members included Michael J. Morell, a former deputy director of the C.I.A.; Cass Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor who ran the office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama White House; Peter Swire, a privacy law specialist at the Georgia Institute of Technology; and Geoffrey R. Stone, a constitutional law specialist at the University of Chicago Law School, where Mr. Obama once taught. Mr. Obama is expected to take the report to Hawaii on his vacation that starts this week and announce decisions when he returns in early January. Some of the report's proposals could be ordered by Mr. Obama alone, while others would require legislation from Congress, including changes to how judges are appointed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said he was skeptical that any changes passed by Congress would go far enough. ''It gives me optimism that it won't be completely brushed under the rug,'' he said. ''However, I've been here long enough to know that in all likelihood when there's a problem, you get window dressing.'' The FISA court, which oversees national security surveillance inside the United States, has been criticized because it hears arguments only from the Justice Department without adversarial lawyers to raise opposing views, and because Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has unilateral power to select its members. Echoing proposals already floated in congressional hearings and elsewhere, the advisory group backs the view that there should be a ''public interest advocate to represent the interests of privacy and civil liberties'' in classified arguments before the court. It also says the power to select judges for the surveillance court should be distributed among all the Supreme Court justices. In backing a restructuring of the N.S.A.'s program that is systematically collecting and storing logs of all Americans' phone calls, the advisers went further than some of the agency's backers in Congress, who would make only cosmetic changes to it, but stopped short of calling for the program to be shut down, as its critics have urged. The N.S.A. uses the telephone data to search for links between people in an effort to identify hidden associates of terrorism suspects, but the report says it ''was not essential to preventing attacks.'' Currently, the government obtains orders from the surveillance court every 90 days that require all the phone companies to give their customers' data to the N.S.A., which commingles the records from every company and stores it for five years. A small group of analysts may query the database -- examining records of everyone who is linked by up to three degrees of separation from a suspect -- if the analyst has ''reasonable, articulable suspicion'' that the original person being examined is linked to terrorism. Under the new system proposed by the review group, such records would stay in private hands -- either scattered among the phone companies or pooled into some kind of private consortium. The N.S.A. would need to make the case to the surveillance court that it has met the standard of suspicion -- and get a judge's order -- every time it wanted to perform such ''link analysis.'' ''In our view, the current storage by the government of bulk metadata creates potential risks to public trust, personal privacy, and civil liberty,'' the report said. The report recommended new privacy protections for the disclosure of personal information about non-Americans among agencies or to the public. The change would extend to foreigners essentially the same protections that citizens have under the Privacy Act of 1974 -- a way of assuring foreign countries that their own citizens, if targeted for surveillance, will enjoy at least some protections under American law. It also said the United States should get out of the business of secretly buying or searching for flaws in common computer programs and using them for mounting cyberattacks. That technique, using what are called zero-day flaws, so named because they are used with zero days of warning that the flaw exists, were crucial to the cyberattacks that the United States and Israel launched on Iran in an effort to slow its nuclear program. The advisers said that the information should be turned over to software manufacturers to have the mistakes fixed, rather than exploited. Regarding spying on foreign leaders, the report urged that the issue be taken out the hands of the intelligence agencies and put into the hands of policy makers. "
Aaron Swartz and Prosecutorial Discretion,"At the funeral for 26-year-old tech prodigy Aaron Swartz, who hanged himself last Friday, his grief-stricken father said that ""Aaron did not commit suicide-he was killed by the government."" Legal bloggers have been debating a less literal version of that accusation: Did Mr. Swartz's prosecutors go too far? Did their zeal border on bullying? A programmer who helped create RSS, Mr. Swartz was also a charismatic leader in the movement to make information free on the Internet. His dedication to that movement led him to try to ""liberate"" the database of more than 1,000 academic journals gathered by JSTOR and sold to universities, libraries and publishers. Over the course of a month or two in 2010 and 2011, he downloaded 4.8 million articles. He was arrested before he could carry out his plan. He turned over his hard drives and JSTOR chose not to sue him.  But the Justice Department, through United States Attorney Carmen Ortiz in Boston, charged him with computer fraud, wire fraud and several of other crimes. Announcing his indictment in 2011, the U.S. attorney's office said, ""If convicted on these charges, Swartz faces up to 35 years in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, restitution, forfeiture and a fine of up to $1 million.""As Emily Bazelon wrote in Slate, ""the causes of suicide are almost always complex, and Swartz suffered from depression."" On Wednesday, Ms. Ortiz released a statement  extending her sympathy to ""everyone who knew and loved"" Mr. Swartz. She also defended herself by emphasizing that she had planned to recommend a sentence of six months at a low-security prison in exchange for his guilty plea. It is plainly not fair to hold Ms. Ortiz responsible for the young man's death. But there is no question that Ms. Ortiz went after Mr. Swartz very aggressively and that she had discretion to handle the case very differently. The best informed account I have seen is by Orin Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University who is an expert in computer crimes. The two parts of his analysis are online here and here. The legal charges in this case, he says, were ""pretty much legit,"" although he thinks the grounds for the basic felony charge of computer fraud are much too easy to meet. ""Some kind of criminal punishment was appropriate,"" Mr. Kerr wrote, because Mr. Swartz was ""intentionally breaking the law in the short run to achieve a long-run goal of nullifying the protections of a set of democratically-enacted laws that he opposed."" The proper sentence was ""the minimum punishment that was needed to persuade Swartz not to do this sort of thing in the future""-which might have been probation, house arrest or some time behind bars. Embedded in Mr. Kerr's analysis was this critical observation: ""What the prosecutors did here was what federal prosecutors often do."" Prosecutors have discretion not to pursue this kind of case at all. But the discretion they often exercise is far at the other end of the spectrum. They go after defendants tooth and nail, overcharging them from the abundance of criminal laws with sentences so severe and out of proportion to the crime that, as now happens in 95 percent of criminal cases, the prudent choice is to cop a plea. The Swartz case deserves singling out not only because of its tragic ending, but because the approach the government took is now the norm. For prosecutors, pursuing cases in this all-out fashion is their job. For defendants like Mr. Swartz, it is a brutal and dispiriting form of intimidation that hardly feels like justice.  "
Online Piracy Alert System to Begin This Week,"The Copyright Alert System, a program of escalating warnings and prods against people suspected of online copyright infringement, is finally going into effect this week, more than a year and a half after the plan was announced as part of an agreement between the entertainment industry and five major Internet service providers.  The Center for Copyright Information, the organization created to administer the system, announced on Monday that the Internet providers would begin putting it in place ""over the course of the next several days,"" though it gave no specifics. The Internet companies are AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast, Verizon and Time Warner Cable. In the alert system, media companies monitor online traffic through a third party and can complain to Internet providers if a file is downloaded illegally. The suspected violator is then given up to six warnings, some of which carry ""educational"" messages and must be acknowledged. After the fifth and sixth warnings, the customer's Internet speed can be slowed to a crawl.The Center for Copyright Information says it will not ask for repeat offenders' Internet access to be blocked, but most service providers have the right to do that if a customer violates its terms of service. The findings can be contested for a $35 fee, to be refunded if an appeal is successful. The introduction of the alert system has been notably slow. Nearly a year passed before the group had a leader in place, and its own prediction failed when it said in October that the system would be coming in two months. Part of the reason for that might be the relationships between media companies and Internet service providers, which in the past have often been adversarial over issues of piracy and control. So-called graduated response programs like the Copyright Alert System have been tried in other countries, with mixed results. France's Hadopi law, passed in 2009, set up a system of three ""strikes,"" culminating in a fine. More than a million warnings have been issued through that plan, but a recent government report said that its effects were ""hard to evaluate precisely.""  "
How to Beat Some Facebook Scammers,"You've probably seen those wildly popular Facebook postings that entice you to share something - like a photo of a bear sneaking up on a man - with the instructions, ""Press Like and type the number 1 and see what happens."" These posts often list hundreds of thousands of responses.  If you've tried it, here's what you saw happen: nothing. Behind the scenes something is happening, though. With each click, a scammer gets a little closer to cashing in. The most thorough explanation I've seen of how this deception works comes from Daylan Pearce, whose job title is Search Lead at Next Digital, described as Australia's largest independent digital agency, in Melbourne. Somewhat simplified, here's how it works. There is a thriving business in selling Facebook pages. The idea is that a page builds an audience, then essentially sells that audience to someone else. It's a practice Facebook opposes, but has limited control over. If a company can buy that audience, its ""edge rank"" will increase. Edge rank - a term people like Mr. Pearce use, but which Facebook doesn't officially acknowledge - measures how often someone's posts show up in other people's news feeds. ""So,"" Mr. Pearce said, ""a page that has 50,000 likes will have greater exposure on people's news feeds than a page with only 10,000."" Edge rank is based on several factors, chief among them affinity, weight and decay, Mr. Pearce said. Affinity is largely based on the number of likes. Weight is based on what accompanies those likes. ""A 'like' isn't worth as much as a comment and a comment isn't worth as much as a 'share,'"" he said. Decay relates to the age of the post. More views, likes and shares over more time increases edge rank. Facebook did not quarrel with the basics of Mr. Pearce's explanation, but said it's more complicated. These scam posts are designed to do three things. Get you to like, comment and share the post. It's a recipe to make it go viral, which takes care of decay. To hook you, the posts make an intriguing promise, or ask you to support a worthy cause - ""like this and share it if you know of someone who has suffered from cancer."" While you can't stop people from such postings, you can keep them off your page and reduce the potential profit. You lower their edge rank when you report or at least hide the post. To do that, hold your cursor over the post and an arrow should appear in the upper right corner. Click it and a drop-down menu offers you the option of hiding or reporting the post. The more often you report or hide these kinds of posts, the less often they will show up in your news feed.  "
A Place Where Old Computers Go to Live,"SEATTLE -  Paul Allen, Microsoft's other founder, with Bill Gates, has a number of museums. There is the Jimi Hendrix Music Experience and his Flying Heritage Collection. The common theme is ""hands on."" You can play a musical instrument and the planes fly. That is no less true for the Living Computer Museum, a relatively new addition. Housed in a three-story warehouse south of downtown Seattle, its striking feature is that almost all  the computers, even those manufactured in the 1960s, actually work.  The showcase machines are legends - like the Digital Equipment Corporation KL-10 introduced in 1974 and  esoteric XKL TOAD-1, a clone of the DEC10. (The Digital Equipment meme runs throughout the museum, possibly because these are the computers Mr. Allen grew up programming.) Opened rather quietly last fall, the museum hasn't attracted  much publicity. That may be true in part because it appears that the collection has been intended for Mr. Allen and his more technical friends, as much as the general public. Indeed, the showcase computers, housed in a realistic ""machine room,"" are systems you probably have never heard of - unless you were a computer hacker in the 1960s or 1970s. One sign that the museum may continue to cater to a rather elite clientele is the party that Mr. Allen held on Tuesday evening to introduce the museum to 150 industry pioneers and a handful of computer journalists - as least those who were writing about computers in the 1970s. Attendees included pioneers from a number of computing eras: Mr.  Gates, of course - the two men posed together, recreating an iconic picture from the 1980s; Bob Frankston and Dan Fylstra of Visicalc (the first spreadsheet); Chris Espinosa, who worked with Steve Jobs in the original garage; Larry Tesler, who came to Apple from Xerox PARC to help design the Lisa; Les Ernest, the assistant director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, who could arguably be said to have invented the predecessors of both Facebook and Twitter; Lee Felsenstein, the designer of two early personal computers, the SOL and the Osborne 1; Nolan Bushnell of Atari; Esther Dyson, one of the first PC industry impresarios, and her brother George, the computer historian. Then there was John Draper, known as ""Captain Crunch"" for discovering an inexpensive method for getting free phone calls by using the whistle from a cereal box.  Mr. Draper, who said he is working on his memoirs and now living in Las Vegas, gently teased Mr. Gates, because it was Mr. Draper's word processor, known as EZ Writer, that I.B.M. chose to offer with the first PC in 1981. Mr. Gates had not yet developed Word. Mr. Gates said he remembered Mr. Draper, who was indirectly instrumental in creating Apple Computer, by teaching the company's two founders how to make phone fraud devices known as Blue Boxes. (Mr. Jobs and Stephen Wozniak then sold the devices to raise money to start Apple.) That Mr. Allen has managed to resurrect so many historic computers is remarkable. He has done it with a relatively small team of seven engineers and a handful of outside consultants. In some cases they have gone to extraordinary lengths to recreate machines where the original instruction manuals have long since vanished. In other cases they have had to finesse the job, when original parts are no longer available or frequently fail. For example, Keith Perez, the lead restoration engineer for the museum, acknowledged that the beautiful display panel of flashing lights for a vintage IBM 360 now blinked with the aid of a number of LED lights. The originals burned out frequently, even at lower than normal power settings, he said. At the end of the event, two buses took Mr. Allen's guests to a downtown hotel for dinner, where engineers swapped tall tales from various computer eras. Before he left for the evening Mr. Allen told the group that when he and Mr. Gates worked for MITS, the maker of the first personal computer, in Albuquerque, he would handle telephone support calls after he finished his day job of writing software. The computer maker had underpriced the machine at $439, and it was such a hot seller that to lower its costs the company had begun shipping the machine without any internal memory. People would then call to say they had assembled the computer and turned it on and it didn't work, he recalled. Mr. Allen would then ask them if all the lights on the computer's front panel were lit.  If they were, that meant there was no DRAM (dynamic random access memory) in the computer, known as the Altair.  When he told the callers this, he said, they would invariably ask, ""What's memory?""

Living Social Hack Exposes Data for 50 Million Customers,"Living Social told employees Friday that it had been breached, and that data for 50 million users might have been accessed. In a memo to employees, the company, based in Washington, said online criminals had accessed usernames, e-mail addresses and dates of births for some users and encrypted passwords for some 50 million people. The company's databases that store user and merchant credit card and banking information were not compromised in the attack, it said.  ""We recently experienced a cyberattack on our computer systems that resulted in unauthorized access to some customer data from our servers,"" the company told employees. ""We are actively working with law enforcement to investigate this issue."" Andrew Weinstein, a spokesman for Living Social, confirmed that the attack might have compromised 50 million of its users, and said the company was resetting passwords and would be alerting customers by e-mail. Mr. Weinstein said it would get in touch with customers in all of the countries LivingSocial operates with the exception of Thailand, Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines, where its systems were not compromised. The attack on Living Social is just the latest in a string of attacks on consumer Internet companies in recent months. Twitter, Facebook and Apple all stepped forward in February to say they had all been the victims of a what they described as a ""sophisticated attack."" Evernote, the online notetaking app, said last month that it had reset passwords for 50 million users after it was compromised by hackers. Living Social did say it ""hashed"" passwords - which involves mashing up users' passwords with a mathematical algorithm - and ""salted"" them, meaning it appended random digits to the end of each hashed password to make it more difficult, but not impossible, for hackers to crack. Once cracked, passwords can be valuable on auctionlike black market sites where a single password can fetch $20.  "
Daily Report: International A.T.M. Theft Takes $45 Million,"It was a huge bank heist - but a 21st-century version in which the robbers never wore ski masks, threatened a teller or set foot in a vault, Marc Santora reportsin The New York Times.  In two precision operations that involved people in more than two dozen countries acting in close coordination and with surgical precision, the organization was able to steal $45 million from thousands of A.T.M.'s in a matter of hours. In New York alone, the thieves responsible for A.T.M. withdrawals struck 2,904 machines over 10 hours on Feb. 19, withdrawing $2.4 million. On Thursday, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn unsealed an indictment charging eight members of the New York crew - including their suspected ringleader, who was found dead in the Dominican Republic on April 27 - offering a glimpse into what the authorities said was one of the most sophisticated and effective cybercrime attacks ever uncovered. ""In the place of guns and masks, this cybercrime organization used laptops and the Internet,"" said Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn. ""Moving as swiftly as data over the Internet, the organization worked its way from the computer systems of international corporations to the streets of New York City, with the defendants fanning out across Manhattan to steal millions of dollars from hundreds of A.T.M.'s in a matter of hours.""

White House Sets U.S.-China Summit for California in June,"President Obama plans to meet President Xi Jinping of China next month for the first time since Mr. Xi's installation as the leader of the world's most populous nation, as the two leaders try to establish a working relationship on critical issues like North Korea, the global economy and allegations of state-sponsored cyber attacks, the White House announced on Monday.  Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi will meet on June 7 and 8 at Sunnylands, the Walter and Leonore Annenberg estate in Southern California, the White House said. Mr. Obama already had travel scheduled on the West Coast at that time, officials said, so they decided that Sunnylands, a less formal setting, would provide a better environment for the two men to get to know each other. To prepare for the meeting, Thomas E. Donilon, the president's national security adviser, will travel to Beijing from May 26 to 28. ""The U.S.-China agenda is big and complex, and we have a lot of issues to discuss and work though,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House. ""As we have said before, the relationship has elements of cooperation and elements of competition. We have no illusions about this. Our approach to China seeks to expand the areas of cooperation in managing regional and global challenges, and we seek to manage our differences in a way that prevents disruptive and unhealthy competition from undermining our interests and those of our allies in Asia."" The meeting will come at a significant moment for the United States and China. As a recent flurry of threats from North Korea underscored, Mr. Obama is encouraging China to play a greater role in restraining the erratic conduct of its isolated neighbor. Moreover, China holds about $1.25 trillion in United States debt, more than any other foreign country, but its share of total debt has fallen in recent years to 7 percent from 10 percent, easing American reliance on Beijing. As for cyber technology issues, the United States has accused China of state-sponsored cyber attacks that it believes have led to the theft of billions of dollars in intellectual property and government documents. The meeting with Mr. Xi in California will be part of a busy few weeks in foreign relations for Mr. Obama. He plans to attend the Group of Eight summit meeting in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in mid-June, where he will meet with longtime allies as well as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. On Monday, the White House announced that Mr. Obama will make a weeklong journey to Africa starting in late June. Sunnylands, a sprawling estate more than 100 miles east of Los Angeles, has played host to seven American presidents, as well as members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the British royal family, and Hollywood figures like Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart and Ginger Rogers, according to its Web site.

Leaks Overshadow Obama's Meeting With President of China,"WASHINGTON - New disclosures about top-secret government programs to collect data on Americans' phone calls and Internet activity are likely to overshadow President Obama's two-day summit this weekend with the president of China. Mr. Obama is set to meet with President Xi Jinping on a 200-acre estate in Southern California on Friday and Saturday, a historic visit that was expected to be a venue for Mr. Obama to raise concerns about Chinese cyber attacks and spying.  But now, that diplomatic conversation will take place in the midst of striking revelations about the United States's surveillance operations on its own citizens. Leaked documents published on Wednesday and Thursday revealed National Security Agency programs to collect vast amounts of information about the daily communications of United States residents with people inside the country and overseas. One program involved an N.S.A. order to a subsidiary of Verizon Communications to provide records of all calls made, but not their content. The other program, according to leaked documents, involved agreements between the N.S.A. and several of the nation's most prominent Internet companies to allow government agencies to collect data from the companies' services.   Late Thursday evening, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, said in a statement that ""only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S."" were targeted. He added that the surveillance was subject to a strict legal review to ""minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about U.S. persons."" A spokesman for Mr. Obama, Josh Earnest, told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday that the judicial oversight of the program ""reflects the president's desire to strike the right balance between protecting our national security and protecting constitutional rights and civil liberties."" He added, ""The president welcomes a discussion of the tradeoffs between security and civil liberties."" Mr. Earnest was also peppered with questions about when and how Mr. Obama himself would discuss the N.S.A. programs. ""Can we expect the president to come out and talk about this at some point?"" a reporter asked. ""I don't anticipate that this will be part of the president's remarks today,"" Mr. Earnest said, referring to the speech at the North Carolina school. ""Not necessarily today, but at some point, as people become more aware of what's been going on?"" the reporter pressed. ""Well, I certainly wouldn't rule it out,"" Mr. Earnest said. The response is complicated by Mr. Obama's 3,000-mile trip to the West Coast. As is typical when the president travels, some top aides are accompanying him while others remain at the White House. With the further disclosure later in the day of the program involving the Internet companies, it is all but certain that reporters will no longer be focusing on the relationship between the United States and China. Instead, they are likely to press aggressively to be given more information about the surveillance programs and to hear directly from Mr. Obama about them. The challenge for the White House will be to juggle those requests with the demands of the mini-summit with Mr. Xi.  "
10 Questions for Jon Huntsman,"Jon M. Huntsman Jr. has forged a rare political path. After serving as the governor of Utah, Mr. Huntsman, a fluent Mandarin speaker, became President Obama's ambassador to China - then resigned to oppose Mr. Obama's re-election with an unsuccessful run for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. Since then, he has helped produce a report on cyberhacking that labeled China ""the world's largest source of intellectual property theft."" Mr. Huntsman sat down with John Harwood of The New York Times and CNBC at the Conrad hotel in New York to discuss Mr. Obama's meeting this week with President Xi Jinping of China, the future of the Republican Party and the 2016 presidential race. What follows is a condensed, edited account of their conversation, as transcribed by Katherine L. Kreider.   Q.  What did you try to do about cyberhacking as ambassador, and why didn't it work?  A.  What I tried to do specifically, and what I think has been tried since, is to find centers of best practices in China. Our thought was, if we can find the examples of excellence of enforcement in China, bring out the local officials and the party bosses and local state-owned enterprises who had been part of that model, and compliment them on it, and get them together with U.S. businesses and laud that good behavior, then those models will expand into something larger. It's slow going, and that's the painful part of it. You have to bring in China, and convince them that doing something about it is actually something in their long-term interest if they actually want to create an innovative and entrepreneurial society, which is their goal.  Q.  To what degree can this be solved by government-to-government diplomacy?  A.  Limited. You can create red lines, boundaries that are set. Every country assumes there are going to be national security targets that are poked at. But when China goes well beyond that, that's when it's a huge problem. The longer-term play is going to be on engaging this entrepreneurial society that's coming in China. They're coming up very quickly. They want to have name-brand, respected entities, they want to go global, they want to come to the United States. If you carry that image and reputation as being a rip-off artist, that's going to hobble you in the marketplace. They're going to be ripped off, too. When I lived in Taiwan in the 1980s, Taiwan was an egregious violator of our intellectual property. When they created their first industrial park dedicated to technology and they had local entrepreneurs innovate and create new stuff, they then took this up as their issue, because it affected them.  Q.  Chinese leaders come and go, and Americans don't really notice the difference. What's different about President Xi?  A.  President Xi is a princeling, the son of the former deputy prime minister. He's a former governor of major provinces, which on a stand-alone basis in terms of population and G.D.P. are bigger than most countries in the world. He's somebody who gets the whole economic side, understands investment and trade and what it takes to make a marketplace work. He's sophisticated, confident. His goal will be to keep the party in power, make sure it is the centerpiece of all things important in Chinese society, but at the same time you have to loosen things up. You have to move towards rule of law and expanded civil society, and greater certainty about investment, trade and commerce. You're going to have to figure out a role for the Internet in society. You can't block it and expect China to become an innovative and prosperous country longer-term.  Q.  Grade President Obama on how he's doing with the Chinese.  A.  Well like most presidents at this point, it's incomplete. I've watched him in action, and I think he's a very solid president as it relates to trying to understand the subject matter, forging a relationship - Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping - I think he's very dedicated to that end. So his priorities might be a little different than the rest of us, but he's doing his best. Now what is interesting here is, the rhythm of the U.S.-Chinese relationship is synchronized for the first time in recent memory. You have the rise of the fifth-generation leaders in China under Xi Jinping and an open set of possibilities here. The president's going to have to forge a head-of-state to head-of-state dialogue. We have never really been able to do that. He'll have to begin to forge a reprioritized agenda with Xi Jinping, where things like cyber will probably poke into the top three or four priority issues.  Q.  Is cyber now more important than currency, which for years was what American politicians talked about?  A.  Currency was always a temporary and fleeting kind of issue, because they're appreciating 3 percent per year when you're factoring in inflation. They're going to have to wind up at a destination for their own purposes, so it's a nonsensical conversation. Cyber, on the other hand, is real - and it's a big dollar volume that we're losing out on as a country. I would guess it would come up as the premier economic issue that would be infused into the dialogue.  Q.  Should Americans be worried that a Chinese meat conglomerate just bought Smithfield Hams  A.  We're part of a global economy, and we need to accept that fact. And when you look at China's total investment in the U.S., it's a small percentage vis-à-vis its entire economic base. For them, the sensitivity will be if America is going to accept its investment, or if it's going to respond like it did 20 years ago with Japanese investment, which would cause a breakdown of our entire economic relationship. They still see America as the premier market anywhere in the world. We're 25 percent of the world's G.D.P., we're safe, we're predictable. But here's the other part: they're going to have to clean up their act as well, whether it's I.P. theft, market access, greater transparency in corporate governance. They're going to have to look a whole lot different as entities as they enter the U.S. market, and that's a good thing. Let the reviews occur on the downside risk, but let's not forget that there's an upside, too. The only way you raise those standards is to get out into the marketplace. You're forced to compete and you're forced to abide by new standards, or you lose business. And knowing China as I do, their desire will be to go up the ladder in terms of quality and value added, and global competitiveness. So this will be part of a longer-term evolution as they engage with the world and try to improve their standards over all for trade and commerce. If you start blocking entry from this country or that country, you get to the Smoot-Hawley tariff situation of a couple of generations ago, and we all know the disaster that ensued from that.  Q.  What's working and what isn't working in our relationship with China right now?  A.  Well, we're up to $500 billion in trade. We were at zero 40 years ago. This relationship has come farther, faster than any relationship in humankind. We now have 200,000 students in this country - China just overtook India with the amount of students in America. You get the next generation learning in our schools, associating with Americans, better understanding our values. And they take that home - that's a huge deal. Our cooperation - however slow or difficult - on Iran and North Korea is way more stepped up today than it has been in the past, because our interests are more and more in line as the top two economies in the world. We don't have enough trust in the relationship to drill down to a level of granularity where you can, for example, talk about contingency planning on the Korean peninsula if you have a failed nation-state in the North. What do you do about the nukes? What do you do about refugees? What do you do about command and control? There isn't a road map developed yet for that kind of thing, which to me should keep policy makers up at night. It did to me in Beijing. It's not the confrontation that I worry about - that's way overblown. What concerns them is the same thing that concerns us, and that is an implosion on the Korean Peninsula by a crazy leader that unleashes uncertainty in a region that is now close to being 20 percent of the world's G.D.P.  Q.  Let's go to U.S. politics. What does it say about the Republican Party that Michele Bachmann made a bigger splash in 2012 than you did?  A.  Politics as theater. There's a lot of entertainment value in politics, I've come to find. So if you want to talk about the big issues of the day and put forward a policy reform to deal with education, energy, foreign affairs, that doesn't get the bounce or the altitude that the political theater does. If you want to call somebody a name, if you want to give a speech with crazy content - that will sell, and that will get you on the front pages of the newspaper. And sadly, that's where politics has become a little surreal and a little too focused on the entertainment side of things. It's bad for the candidates and it's really bad for the voters. The substance and the vision about where this country is going, rarely is that able to get to the surface.  Q.  Republicans seem to be rallying more around investigations of the Obama administration, as opposed to what Representative Paul Ryan is trying to do in the budget, what Representative Dave Camp's trying to do on tax reform, what Senator Marco Rubio is trying to do on immigration. Do you see any prospect this is going to change?  A.  Probably not. But scandal-mongering, however serious these issues are, is not a strategy. I think this illustrates the disconnect between the culture of Capitol Hill and Americans everywhere else who say, ""We haven't seen this country work in a long time. Prove to us, political leader, that this nation can still work, and produce jobs, and compete, and educate the next generation and bring to the forefront an energy agenda that will allow us to become energy independent."" So, all of the things that will kind of bring this nation back on its feet, that's what Americans want to see and hear about. They want to know their country works and that their country is relevant, and sometimes that conversation isn't seen enough on Capitol Hill. Republicans need to be seen as problem solvers. You have to sit at a table, you have to grind away, you have to compromise. So long as compromise is seen as something analogous to treason, we will lose. Phasing out the loopholes and deductions in the tax code - many have said, traditionally, even that step would constitute a tax increase. I don't know what world those folks are living on, but to me that's a way to move forward, clean up the tax code, make us more competitive, broaden the base, lower the rate and leave this nation with a much more competitive code that hasn't been addressed since 1986.  Q.  How are you going to go about deciding whether to run for president again?  A.  I think this cycle will be driven by ideas and less by personalities. People out there want to hear the ideas that will move this nation forward. And if those ideas bring somebody forward as a candidate, then I think that's probably how things are going to work. The next two years will really tell that story. I'm ready and willing and prepared to serve. But the ideas will drive that or not. If you find early on that people just really don't like your ideas, why waste your time? The millennials are a very smart generation. They get the big issues that we're working on. I think they get the idea that unity, and appealing to a broader demographic, is the only way the Republicans are going to survive long term. So we'll see how 2016 goes.  "
Can N.S.A. Surveillance Be Likened to Chinese Spying?,"BEIJING -""Snowden: American Government Invaded Chinese Computers,"" ran a headline Thursday on CCTV, China's state-run television channel. ""'Prismgate': America Owes Global Netizens an Explanation,"" said an editorial in the Chinese-language edition of the Global Times, a newspaper that is part of the Communist Party-run People's Daily group. And: ""For months, Washington has been accusing China of cyberespionage, but it turns out that the biggest threat to the pursuit of individual freedom and privacy in the U.S. is the unbridled power of the government,"" the China Daily, a state-run newspaper, quoted Li Haidong, a researcher of American studies at China Foreign Affairs University, as saying in a story titled ""Surveillance program a test of Sino-U.S. ties."" Reaction was swelling on Thursday in China's state media to the leaks by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency computer technician, of highly classified documents about the United States' monitoring of Internet and telephone communications.  And the tone appeared to be increasingly sharp, focusing on reports that the programs included surveillance of Hong Kong and Chinese computers and people, with the South China Morning Post reporting very early Thursday morning about ""explosive claims that the U.S. government had been hacking into computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland for years,"" in an interview with Mr. Snowden conducted at a secret location in Hong Kong. Yet questions were being raised: Are the two events, U.S. allegations of Chinese hacking of military and commercial secrets, and the N.S.A's surveillance programs, even similar? Some thought not. Snowden's biggest harm to US isn't outing secret program, but politically neutering US response to China's far more serious hacking campaign - Patrick Chovanec (@prchovanec)13 Jun 13 There were plenty of accusations on China's lively Weibos, or microblogs, of ""hypocrisy"" by the United States, the English-language Post reported. Another view: ""As much as we are so willing to criticize the US for their bad behaviour,"" wrote Zhao Xiao, a professor at University of Science and Technology Beijing, on his microblog, ""it doesn't give China the excuse to act more evil,"" the Post reported. Here's what Mr. Snowden said about N.S.A. surveillance of Hong Kong and mainland China, according to the Post: ""The N.S.A. had been hacking computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland since 2009. None of the documents revealed any information about Chinese military systems,"" he said. One of the targets in Hong Kong was the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and public officials, businesses and students in the city, the Post reported. ""The documents also point to hacking activity by the N.S.A. against mainland targets,"" it wrote. ""Snowden believed there had been more than 61,000 N.S.A. hacking operations globally, with hundreds of targets in Hong Kong and on the mainland."" In the article, Mr. Snowden used the word ""hacking,"" instead of the more emotionally loaded word used by CCTV, ""invade."" In Chinese, the word, ""ruqin,"" implies actual physical invasion. In Washington, Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the State Department, ""rejected the idea that such an incident would represent double standards given recent U.S. criticism of Chinese cyber attacks,"" according to The Guardian newspaper, which has led the reporting of Mr. Snowden's leaks. ""There is a difference between going after economic data and the issues of surveillance that the president has addressed which are about trying to stop people doing us harm,"" it cited Ms. Psaki as saying. Mr. Snowden's leaks were made public last week, when the Chinese and the U.S. presidents met in California for talks that both sides deemed important. Chinese espionage was high on the U.S. agenda following a series of reports there about large, sophisticated cyber-based efforts - apparently successful - from China to extract American commercial and military secrets. The New York Times has written about the scale and breadth of the campaign: while cyberespionage is the focus of much attention, it has also pointed to allegations that China has for decades waged a campaign to get technology from the developed world, by any means necessary, as a shortcut to development. A U.S. intelligence employee, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the two situations - China's stealing of trade and military secrets and N.S.A. surveillance to track possible terrorist attacks - are not comparable, calling them ""apples and oranges."" ""I can tell you with absolute certainty the U.S. government does not pass on technological secrets obtained through (strictly speaking, as a byproduct of) espionage to U.S. firms, both as a matter of principle and because there is no fair way to do it,"" he wrote in answer to an e-mailed question. ""I recall some senior bureaucrat proposing this some two decades ago - and he got nowhere,"" the person wrote. ""None of the agencies wanted anything to do with it."" ""China, by contrast, deliberately targets foreign technology for military and commercial purposes, so this is apples and oranges,"" he wrote. ""But in the propaganda war, that fact won't matter."" Comments in The China Daily reinforced that view: ""The massive U.S. global surveillance program revealed by a former C.I.A. whistle-blower in HongKong is certain to stain Washington's overseas image and test developing Sino-U.S. ties,"" the newspaper wrote, citing analysts. The Global Times' commentary concluded: ""But in reality, we are not bystanders. If as the Internet superpower America overstepped its capabilities, this question directly touches on our vital interests."" As The New York Times reported from Hong Kong, Li Siling, a social media expert at the China Executive Leadership Academy in Pudong, in Shanghai, said that Mr. Snowden's disclosures were likely to play into the hands of those in Beijing who favor a strong security apparatus. ""They will say the U.S. is supposed to be the most free country in the world, but they still monitor the Internet and tap every phone,"" Mr. Li said.  Is it right to see similarities in stealing economic and military data and gathering information to try to stop terrorist attacks? Is that even the issue here? Is there hypocrisy here, and if so, from whom? The U.S.? China? Both? Tell us what you think.   "
The Real War on Reality,"If there is one thing we can take away from the news of recent weeks it is this: the modern American surveillance state is not really the stuff of paranoid fantasies; it has arrived. The revelations about the National Security Agency's PRISM data collection program have raised awareness - and understandably, concern and fears - among American and those abroad, about the reach and power of secret intelligence gatherers operating behind the facades of government and business. But those revelations, captivating as they are, have been partial -they primarily focus on one government agency and on the surveillance end of intelligence work, purportedly done in the interest of national security.  What has received less attention is the fact that most intelligence work today is not carried out by government agencies but by private intelligence firms and that much of that work involves another common aspect of intelligence work: deception. That is, it is involved not just with the concealment of reality, but with the manufacture of it.  The realm of secrecy and deception among shadowy yet powerful forces may sound like the province of investigative reporters, thriller novelists and Hollywood moviemakers - and it is - but it is also a matter for philosophers. More accurately, understanding deception and and how it can be exposed has been a principle project of philosophy for the last 2500 years. And it is a place where the work of journalists, philosophers and other truth-seekers can meet. In one of the most referenced allegories in the Western intellectual tradition, Plato describes a group of individuals shackled inside a cave with a fire behind them. They are able to see only shadows cast upon a wall by the people walking behind them. They mistake shadows for reality. To see things as they truly are, they need to be unshackled and make their way outside the cave. Reporting on the world as it truly is outside the cave is one of the foundational duties of philosophers. In a more contemporary sense, we should also think of the efforts to operate in total secrecy and engage in the creation of false impressions and realities as a problem area in epistemology - the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of knowledge. And philosophers interested in optimizing our knowledge should consider such surveillance and deception not just fodder for the next ""Matrix"" movie, but as real sort of epistemic warfare. To get some perspective on the manipulative role that private intelligence agencies play in our society, it is worth examining information that has been revealed by some significant hacks in the past few years of previously secret data. Important insight into the world these companies came from a 2010 hack by a group best known as LulzSec  (at the time the group was called Internet Feds), which targeted the private intelligence firm HBGary Federal.  That hack yielded 75,000 e-mails.  It revealed, for example, that Bank of America approached the Department of Justice over concerns about information that WikiLeaks had about it.  The Department of Justice in turn referred Bank of America to the lobbying firm Hunton and Willliams, which in turn connected the bank with a group of information security firms collectively known as Team Themis. Team Themis (a group that included HBGary and the private intelligence and security firms Palantir Technologies, Berico Technologies and Endgame Systems) was effectively brought in to find a way to undermine the credibility of WikiLeaks and the journalist Glenn Greenwald (who recently broke the story of Edward Snowden's leak of the N.S.A.'s Prism program),  because of Greenwald's support for WikiLeaks. Specifically, the plan called for actions to ""sabotage or discredit the opposing organization"" including a plan to submit fake documents and then call out the error. As for Greenwald, it was argued that he would cave ""if pushed"" because he would ""choose professional preservation over cause."" That evidently wasn't the case. Team Themis also developed a proposal for the Chamber of Commerce to undermine the credibility of one of its critics, a group called Chamber Watch. The proposal called for first creating a ""false document, perhaps highlighting periodical financial information,"" giving it to a progressive group opposing the Chamber, and then subsequently exposing the document as a fake to ""prove that U.S. Chamber Watch cannot be trusted with information and/or tell the truth."" (A photocopy of the proposal can be found here.) In addition, the group proposed creating a ""fake insider persona"" to infiltrate Chamber Watch.  They would ""create two fake insider personas, using one as leverage to discredit the other while confirming the legitimacy of the second."" The hack also revealed evidence that Team Themis was developing a ""persona management"" system - a program, developed at the specific request of the United States Air Force, that allowed one user to control multiple online identities (""sock puppets"") for commenting in social media spaces, thus giving the appearance of grass roots support.  The contract was eventually awarded to another private intelligence firm. This may sound like nothing so much as a ""Matrix""-like fantasy, but it is distinctly real, and resembles in some ways the employment of ""Psyops"" (psychological operations), which as most students of recent American history know, have been part of the nation's military strategy for decades. The military's ""Unconventional Warfare Training Manual"" defines Psyops as ""planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals."" In other words, it is sometimes more effective to deceive a population into a false reality than it is to impose its will with force or conventional weapons.  Of course this could also apply to one's own population if you chose to view it as an ""enemy"" whose ""motives, reasoning, and behavior"" needed to be controlled. Psyops need not be conducted by nation states; they can be undertaken by anyone with the capabilities and the incentive to conduct them, and in the case of private intelligence contractors, there are both incentives (billions of dollars in contracts) and capabilities. Several months after the hack of HBGary, a Chicago area activist and hacker named Jeremy Hammond successfully hacked into another private intelligence firm - Strategic Forcasting Inc., or Stratfor), and released approximately five million e-mails. This hack provided a remarkable insight into how the private security and intelligence companies view themselves vis a vis government security agencies like the C.I.A. In a 2004 e-mail to Stratfor employees, the firm's founder and chairman George Friedman was downright dismissive of the C.I.A.'s capabilities relative to their own:  ""Everyone in Langley [the C.I.A.] knows that we do things they have never been able to do with a small fraction of their resources. They have always asked how we did it. We can now show them and maybe they can learn."" The Stratfor e-mails provided us just one more narrow glimpse into the world of the private security firms, but the view was frightening.  The leaked e-mails revealed surveillance activities to monitor protestors in Occupy Austin as well as Occupy's relation to the environmental group Deep Green Resistance.  Staffers discussed how one of their own men went undercover (""U/C"") and inquired about an Occupy Austin General Assembly meeting to gain insight into how the group operates. Stratfor was also involved in monitoring activists who were seeking reparations for victims of a chemical plant disaster in Bhopal, India, including a group called Bophal Medical Appeal. But the targets also included The Yes Men, a satirical group that had humiliated Dow Chemical with a fake news conference announcing reparations for the victims.  Stratfor regularly copied several Dow officers on the minutia of activities by the two members of the Yes Men. One intriguing e-mail revealed that the Coca-Cola company was asking Stratfor for intelligence on PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) with Stratfor vice president for Intelligence claiming that ""The F.B.I. has a classified investigation on PETA operatives. I'll see what I can uncover."" From this one could get the impression that the F.B.I. was in effect working as a private detective Stratfor and its corporate clients. Stratfor also had a broad-ranging public relations campaign.  The e-mails revealed numerous media companies on its payroll. While one motivation for the partnerships was presumably to have sources of intelligence, Stratfor worked hard to have soap boxes from which to project its interests. In one 2007 e-mail, it seemed that Stratfor was close to securing a regular show on NPR: ""[the producer] agreed that she wants to not just get George or Stratfor on one time on NPR but help us figure the right way to have a relationship between 'Morning Edition' and Stratfor."" On May 28 Jeremy Hammond pled guilty to the Stratfor hack, noting that even if he could successfully defend himself against the charges he was facing, the Department of Justice promised him that he would face the same charges in eight different districts and he would be shipped to all of them in turn.  He would become a defendant for life.  He had no choice but to plea to a deal in which he may be sentenced to 10 years in prison.  But even as he made the plea he issued a statement, saying ""I did this because I believe people have a right to know what governments and corporations are doing behind closed doors. I did what I believe is right.""  (In a video interview conducted by Glenn Greenwald with Edward Snowden in Hong Kong this week, Snowden expressed a similar ethical stance regarding his actions.) Given the scope and content of what Hammond's hacks exposed, his supporters agree that what he did was right. In their view, the private intelligence industry is effectively engaged in Psyops against American public., engaging in ""planned operations to convey selected information to [us] to influence [our] emotions, motives, objective reasoning and, ultimately, [our] behavior""? Or as the philosopher might put it, they are engaged in epistemic warfare. The Greek word deployed by Plato in ""The Cave"" - aletheia - is typically translated as truth, but is more aptly translated as ""disclosure"" or ""uncovering"" -   literally, ""the state of not being hidden.""   Martin Heidegger, in an essay on the allegory of the cave, suggested that the process of uncovering was actually a precondition for having truth.  It would then follow that the goal of the truth-seeker is to help people in this disclosure - it is to defeat the illusory representations that prevent us from seeing the world the way it is.  There is no propositional truth to be had until this first task is complete. This is the key to understanding why hackers like Jeremy Hammond are held in such high regard by their supporters.  They aren't just fellow activists or fellow hackers - they are defending us from epistemic attack.  Their actions help lift the hood that is periodically pulled over our eyes to blind us from the truth.  Peter Ludlow is a professor of philosophy at Northwestern University and is currently co-producing (with Vivien Weisman) a documentary on Hacktivist actions against private intelligence firms and the surveillance state.

Snowden's Questionable New Turn,"When Edward Snowden first began leaking documents he purloined from the National Security Agency, he seemed to have a clear sense of purpose. He wanted to let Americans know that their government was secretly spying on the phone records of millions of innocent citizens, infringing on their civil liberties, and that it was demanding information on some of the Internet traffic flowing through American computer systems. ""The government has granted itself power it is not entitled to,"" he told the Guardianearlier this month. ""There is no public oversight.""  Mr. Snowden's actions, though illegal, exposed programs that many people, including lawmakers of both parties, believed had gone too far. The leaks showed how the intelligence community had used the cover of secrecy to expand and abuse its domestic surveillance powers, surprising even people who had written the post-9/11 laws on which these powers were supposed to be based. They have spurred a useful and important debate on whether those laws should be changed. In the last few days, however, Mr. Snowden's leaks have taken a questionable turn. Hetold the South China Morning Postthat the United States had hacked into many Chinese computer systems, including those at universities and businesses. And yesterday he showed documents to the Guardianrevealing that the N.S.A. and its British counterpart had spied on politicians from around the world who attended the 2009 G-20 summit in London.These documents are of a different and more dubious order than the first ones. Like all leaks, their benefits have to be weighed against their potential harm, and in this case, it's difficult to see what the benefits are. The N.S.A. was created to spy on overseas communications, and there is no serious debate about whether it should be doing so. Revealing that it was monitoring the computer traffic of foreign countries, and listening to their leaders, sheds no particularly useful light on the N.S.A.'s mission, or what most people believed its activities to be. On the other hand, it was not supposed to be doing domestic spying, which is why the collection of phone records, and the extensive demands for Internet traffic records, were so disturbing. In an online chat today with readers of the Guardian, Mr. Snowden expressed outrage that the United States would hack into civilian computers overseas, which he called ""nakedly, aggressively criminal acts."" And he came up with an odd formulation for what the N.S.A. should and shouldn't be doing overseas: ""Congress hasn't declared war on the countries,"" he wrote. ""The majority of them are our allies, but without asking for public permission, N.S.A. is running network operations against them that affect millions of innocent people."" So apparently he believes that the United States shouldn't engage in spying except for countries with which it is at war. Of course, we're not at war with any countries right now, only with Al Qaeda and its allies, so that would mean shutting down all non-terror spying activities. The idea that we should unilaterally discard a practice - however distasteful - used for centuries by virtually every country that can afford a spy service is naïve. Every industrialized country spies on every other, in part to learn just how much they are being spied on. What exactly was it he believed the intelligence world did when he first started making money by working for it?  "
Why No Byline or Named Source for an Article About a Leak Investigation?,"A careful reader of The Times, David Smollar of San Diego, makes some astute observations about an unusual article in Friday's paper. The article caught many people's eyes because it lacked a byline. It also quoted Jill Abramson, the executive editor, and it used an unnamed source to confirm an NBC News report that a retired Marine officer, Gen. James E. Cartwright, is a target of a leak investigation about American cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear program.  As Mr. Smollar noted, the article required some ""mental gymnastics"" on the part of the reader. He wrote: It quotes a ""person familiar with the investigation"" confirming an investigation of Cartwright as (the/a) leaker for NY Times stories that used unidentified sources about cyberattacks against Iran by the U.S. It quotes Jill Abramson as declining comment on matters that involve ""confidential sources."" So here we have an NY Times story, with no byline, that uses a confidential source to confirm an investigation about someone suspected of being a confidential source for a series of NY Times stories. And the NY Times itself refusing to comment on a story written by the NY Times about the NY Times. He added: ""Confusing? You bet! My head was spinning after reading the article."" I asked the managing editor Dean Baquet to explain the background. He told me that there was a rush Thursday night to confirm the NBC news report. The lack of a byline was ""not a political decision"" in any way but simply reflected the number of reporters working on what turned out to be a brief article, he said. In an e-mail, Mr. Baquet wrote: ""It was a short story that numerous people scrambled to confirm when the networks broke it. It seemed odd to have more than one byline, and no one felt any real ownership of it."" As for the confidentiality of the source, Mr. Baquet couldn't comment on that any more than Ms. Abramson was able to in the article itself. The use of unnamed sources is never ideal. Sometimes it's necessary to get important information on the record. While I can't disagree entirely with Mr. Smollar's criticism, there probably was no alternative, given the deadline situation.  3:35 p.m. | Updated Friday afternoon, Foreign Policy magazine published a piece online that analyzes and helps make sense of the development. "
Manning and Snowden,"In the cases of mega-leakers Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden, the United States has sent a crude but clear message: if you're thinking of violating your obligation to keep secrets, think again, because we will track you down and smack you down. You may be sainted whistleblowers in the eyes of some, but you are traitors in the eyes of your government.  In the Manning case, the gratuitous and implausible charge of aiding the enemy - thankfully rejected Tuesday by the presiding judge, Colonel Denise Lind - was particularly chilling. Manning's motives in leaking a treasury of secrets to WikiLeaks seemed to be a mix of politics and personal discontent, but there was no evidence he intended or even imagined that his disclosures would help America's enemies. And if we're going to start punishing revelations that inadvertently give comfort to the enemy, what's next? If you follow that logic, every poll that says Americans want to get out of Afghanistan, every news story about popular discontent over drone strikes or surveillance - in short, every publication that casts the country in an unfavorable light - boosts morale at Al Qaeda headquarters, and thus aids the enemy. That's why news organizations watched that charge with particular foreboding.  Even acquitted of aiding the enemy, Manning was convicted of crimes that could add up to, by one reckoning, 100 years of prison time. The prosecutorial excess - combined with the grotesque treatment of the soldier after his arrest, when he was held for nine months in solitary confinement and forced to sleep without clothes or bedding - probably swelled the ranks of those who regard Manning as a victim, if not a martyr. It also, in keeping with the rest of this administration's heavy-handed war on leakers, tilts the balance in the tense coexistence between the government and the investigative press, between secrecy and accountability.And it signals pretty clearly that if the U.S. ever gets its hands on Snowden - still encamped in the transit lounge of Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow - he can expect no mercy. In his case, that would be not just another example of prosecutorial overkill, but just possibly a missed opportunity. Whatever you think of Snowden, his revelations of wholesale secret surveillance of phone and email meta-data have awakened a healthy new suspicion of the surveillance state and have highlighted a disturbing lack of oversight.  I'm not suggesting we give him a medal. But what about a plea bargain? Suppose that instead of declaring its determination to pursue him to the ends of the earth and lock him up for life, the Justice Department offered him a deal: come home, serve some time for violating your sworn obligations, and in exchange for a lighter sentence give us your full cooperation. Help us figure out how to better keep our legitimate secrets. Help us build better safeguards against abuses of privacy. Help us redraw the boundaries between government security agencies and the for-profit contractors to whom we have ceded too much. Snowden may be naïve in his choice of asylum destinations, but he seems to know his way around the clandestine cyber-world. There are precedents for this, in both of the worlds that Snowden straddles - hacking and national security. The government has on occasion offered leniency to hackers in exchange for their help assessing the vulnerabilities of important computer systems.  Likewise, the government has bargained with convicted spies in order to learn just what secrets they had divulged and for information about enemy operatives and tradecraft. I called Mark Rasch, a former Justice Department prosecutor who did such deals with both spies and hackers, including the famous case of Robert Morris, the hacker convicted in 1990 of planting a computer worm, and now a professor at MIT. Rasch was intrigued by the idea, but skeptical that Snowden has much to bargain with.  ""The problems that he's aware of, the NSA is already aware of,"" Rasch said. ""We need a better mechanism for reporting concerns with classified programs, a way to get information outside of the chain of command, to genuine policy-makers. We don't need Manning or Snowden to tell us that."" ""He'd be in a much better position negotiating-wise if he was actually a spy,"" Rasch said. Maybe so. But we'll never find out if the first and only reflex is to squash the leaker.  "
Canadian Teenager's Suicide Case Is Back in Spotlight,"Updated, Friday, 12:43 p.m. | The suicide of a Canadian teenager in April revived outrage that the police did not go far enough to investigate allegations that she was gang-raped in 2011, then bullied after images of the assault were shared and posted online.  But now the first charges have been announced in the case of the teenager, Rehtaeh Parsons, whose death prompted Canada to take a new look at legislation and police work covering material posted online.  Ms. Parsons's rape case was briefly investigated in November 2011 but then reopened in April after her death revived public attention. Ms. Parsons hanged herself in the bathroom at home and was discovered when her mother broke down the door. Three days later, she was taken off life support and died.  On Thursday, as a result of that renewed investigation, the police announced they had taken two 18-year-old men into custody for questioning. They later charged one of them with two counts of distribution of child pornography and the other with one count of distribution of child pornography and one count of making child pornography.  There were no rape charges. ""The available evidence did not meet the threshold for sexual assault charges against the two individuals in this matter,"" said Chief Jean-Michel Blais, of the Halifax Regional Police, at a news conference late on Thursday. But he said if new verified information or a confession became available, that could change. The two men were released after being charged and will appear in Halifax Youth Court on Aug. 15. Their names were not announced because of their age at the time.  Cpl. Scott MacRae, a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who described the arrests  as a ""significant event"" in the case, said on Friday the charges were based on one image, although some accounts have said several photographs were shared. As The Lede reported in April, the authorities quoted in a Canadian television network's  had said there was not enough evidence after the first investigation to bring charges. But Corporal MacRae said on Thursday that the arrests were the result of months of renewed investigation with the regional police into files and additional information after she died. Ms. Parsons's suicide, at age 17, had sparked criticism over how the authorities handled the gang rape allegations and whether they were equipped to fight cyberbullying. Some drew comparisons with the Steubenville rape in Ohio in the United States, because a cellphone photograph that was distributed among students at Ms. Parsons's school apparently showed the sexual assault taking place.  Ms. Parsons's case also attracted support from a loose network of hackers who identify themselves as belonging to the Anonymous collective, who said they had uncovered the names of the teenagers believed involved in the rape, soliciting online support through Twitter using #OpJustice4Rehtaeh. A video attributed to Anonymous said that it had names of two of the ""alleged rapists"" but would soon have all four. An account called AnonNorth and others reacted to the news of the arrests by noting the role played by Anonymous. @am640 If #Anonymous didn't get involved would there have been an investigation/arrests in the Rehtaeh case? #OpJustice4Rehtaeh - AnonNorth (@AnonymousNorth)8 Aug 13 In addition to the renewed police investigation, Ms. Parsons's case influenced parts of a new Cyber-Safety Act that went into effect on Wednesday in Nova Scotia, according to a statement by the Nova Scotia justice minister, Ross Landry. While criminal law in Canada is federal, the provincial legislation allows victims to apply for a protection order that could place restrictions on, or help identify, the cyberbully, and even sue the cyberbully, whose parents can be held liable for damages if the cyberbully is a minor, the statement said. The case also affected the way the police carried out their work. In the news conference, officers said that the team was expanded beyond the sexual assault experts used the first time around. ""We are in a constant state of learning to do things better,"" said Chief Superintendent Roland Wells, of the Halifax district R.C.M.P.  Chief Blais said they were re-examining the way the police conducted investigations on the Internet and the ways they obtain information.  ""It was driven a lot by social media,"" he said. There were also questions about the extent to which public pressure came to bear on the case. Chief Wells denied there had been any efforts to ""placate"" the public, while also adding during the news conference that the sentence ""won't be impacted by global interest."" In media interviews, Ms. Parsons's mother, Leah Parsons, said the police came to her home on Thursday morning after the arrests to let her know. She said she felt ""a little bit of a sense of relief that finally something has been done after all this time,"" according to a report by The Chronicle Herald.  The newspaper quoted her as saying that she knows who was arrested: ""The boys (have said) they want to give their side of the story, but they've never given their side of the story. So here's their opportunity."" She also spoke in an interview with CBC News, saying that the men arrested were ""in the heart of it,"" when asked whether they were on the periphery of what happened to her daughter or central to it. The Chronicle Herald interviewed her father, Glen Canning, who called the news of the arrests ""bittersweet."" UPDATE: ""It's a little bit of bittersweet justice,"" Rehtaeh Parsons's father @GlenfordCanning tells us re: arrests http://t.co/NLUctaCbsZ - The Chronicle Herald (@chronicleherald)8 Aug 13  "
The Banality of Systemic Evil,"In recent months there has been a visible struggle in the media to come to grips with the leaking, whistle-blowing and hacktivism that has vexed the United States military and the private and government intelligence communities. This response has run the gamut. It has involved attempts to condemn, support, demonize, psychoanalyze and in some cases canonize figures like Aaron Swartz, Jeremy Hammond, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden. In broad terms, commentators in the mainstream and corporate media have tended to assume that all of these actors needed to be brought to justice, while independent players on the Internet and elsewhere have been much more supportive. Tellingly, a recent Time magazine cover story has pointed out a marked generational difference in how people view these matters: 70 percent of those age 18 to 34 sampled in a poll said they believed that Snowden ""did a good thing"" in leaking the news of the National Security Agency's surveillance program. So has the younger generation lost its moral compass?  No. In my view, just the opposite. Clearly, there is a moral principle at work in the actions of the leakers, whistle-blowers and hacktivists and those who support them. I would also argue that that moral principle has been clearly articulated, and it may just save us from a dystopian future. In ""Eichmann in Jerusalem,"" one of the most poignant and important works of 20th-century philosophy, Hannah Arendt made an observation about what she called ""the banality of evil."" One interpretation of this holds that it was not an observation about what a regular guy Adolph Eichmann seemed to be, but rather a statement about what happens when people play their ""proper"" roles within a system, following prescribed conduct with respect to that system, while remaining blind to the moral consequences of what the system was doing - or at least compartmentalizing and ignoring those consequences. A good illustration of this phenomenon appears in ""Moral Mazes,"" a book by the sociologist Robert Jackall that explored the ethics of decision making within several corporate bureaucracies. In it, Jackall made several observations that dovetailed with those of Arendt. The mid-level managers that he spoke with were not ""evil"" people in their everyday lives, but in the context of their jobs, they had a separate moral code altogether, what Jackall calls the ""fundamental rules of corporate life"": (1) You never go around your boss. (2) You tell your boss what he wants to hear, even when your boss claims that he wants dissenting views. (3) If your boss wants something dropped, you drop it. (4) You are sensitive to your boss's wishes so that you anticipate what he wants; you don't force him, in other words, to act as a boss. (5) Your job is not to report something that your boss does not want reported, but rather to cover it up. You do your job and you keep your mouth shut. Jackall went through case after case in which managers violated this code and were drummed out of a business (for example, for reporting wrongdoing in the cleanup at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant). Aaron Swartz counted ""Moral Mazes"" among his ""very favorite books."" Swartz was the Internet wunderkind who was hounded by a government prosecution threatening him with 35 years in jail for illicitly downloading academic journals that were behind a pay wall. Swartz, who committed suicide in January at age 26 (many believe because of his prosecution), said that ""Moral Mazes"" did an excellent job of ""explaining how so many well-intentioned people can end up committing so much evil."" Swartz argued that it was sometimes necessary to break the rules that required obedience to the system in order to avoid systemic evil. In Swartz's case the system was not a corporation but a system for the dissemination of bottled up knowledge that should have been available to all. Swartz engaged in an act of civil disobedience to liberate that knowledge, arguing that ""there is no justice in following unjust laws. It's time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture."" Chelsea Manning, the United States Army private incarcerated for leaking classified documents from the Departments of Defense and State, felt a similar pull to resist the internal rules of the bureaucracy. In a statement at her trial she described a case where she felt this was necessary. In February 2010, she received a report of an event in which the Iraqi Federal Police had detained 15 people for printing ""anti-Iraqi"" literature. Upon investigating the matter, Manning discovered that none of the 15 had previous ties to anti-Iraqi actions or suspected terrorist organizations. Manning had the allegedly anti-Iraqi literature translated and found that, contrary to what the federal police had said, the published literature in question ""detailed corruption within the cabinet of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's government and the financial impact of his corruption on the Iraqi people."" When Manning reported this discrepancy to the officer in charge (OIC), she was told to ""drop it,"" she recounted. Manning could not play along. As she put it, she knew if she ""continued to assist the Baghdad Federal Police in identifying the political opponents of Prime Minister al-Maliki, those people would be arrested and in the custody of the Special Unit of the Baghdad Federal Police and very likely tortured and not seen again for a very long time - if ever."" When her superiors would not address the problem, she was compelled to pass this information on to WikiLeaks. Snowden too felt that, confronting what was clearly wrong, he could not play his proper role within the bureaucracy of the intelligence community. As he put it, [W]hen you talk to people about [abuses] in a place like this where this is the normal state of business people tend not to take them very seriously and move on from them. But over time that awareness of wrongdoing sort of builds up and you feel compelled to talk about [them]. And the more you talk about [them] the more you're ignored. The more you're told it's not a problem until eventually you realize that these things need to be determined by the public and not by somebody who was simply hired by the government. The bureaucracy was telling him to shut up and move on (in accord with the five rules in ""Moral Mazes""), but Snowden felt that doing so was morally wrong. In a June Op-Ed in The Times, David Brooks made a case for why he thought Snowden was wrong to leak information about the Prism surveillance program. His reasoning cleanly framed the alternative to the moral code endorsed by Swartz, Manning and Snowden. ""For society to function well,"" he wrote, ""there have to be basic levels of trust and cooperation, a respect for institutions and deference to common procedures. By deciding to unilaterally leak secret N.S.A. documents, Snowden has betrayed all of these things."" The complaint is eerily parallel to one from a case discussed in ""Moral Mazes,"" where an accountant was dismissed because he insisted on reporting ""irregular payments, doctored invoices, and shuffling numbers."" The complaint against the accountant by the other managers of his company was that ""by insisting on his own moral purity ... he eroded the fundamental trust and understanding that makes cooperative managerial work possible."" But wasn't there arrogance or hubris in Snowden's and Manning's decisions to leak the documents? After all, weren't there established procedures determining what was right further up the organizational chart? Weren't these ethical decisions better left to someone with a higher pay grade? The former United States ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton, argued that Snowden ""thinks he's smarter and has a higher morality than the rest of us ... that he can see clearer than other 299, 999, 999 of us, and therefore he can do what he wants. I say that is the worst form of treason."" For the leaker and whistleblower the answer to Bolton is that there can be no expectation that the system will act morally of its own accord. Systems are optimized for their own survival and preventing the system from doing evil may well require breaking with organizational niceties, protocols or laws. It requires stepping outside of one's assigned organizational role. The chief executive is not in a better position to recognize systemic evil than is a middle level manager or, for that matter, an IT contractor. Recognizing systemic evil does not require rank or intelligence, just honesty of vision. Persons of conscience who step outside their assigned organizational roles are not new. There are many famous earlier examples, including Daniel Ellsberg (the Pentagon Papers), John Kiriakou (of the Central Intelligence Agency) and several former N.S.A. employees, who blew the whistle on what they saw as an unconstitutional and immoral surveillance program (William Binney, Russ Tice and Thomas Drake, for example). But it seems that we are witnessing a new generation of whistleblowers and leakers, which we might call generation W (for the generation that came of age in the era WikiLeaks, and now the war on whistleblowing). The media's desire to psychoanalyze members of generation W is natural enough. They want to know why these people are acting in a way that they, members of the corporate media, would not. But sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander; if there are psychological motivations for whistleblowing, leaking and hacktivism, there are likewise psychological motivations for closing ranks with the power structure within a system - in this case a system in which corporate media plays an important role. Similarly it is possible that the system itself is sick, even though the actors within the organization are behaving in accord with organizational etiquette and respecting the internal bonds of trust. Just as Hannah Arendt saw that the combined action of loyal managers can give rise to unspeakable systemic evil, so too generation W has seen that complicity within the surveillance state can give rise to evil as well - not the horrific evil that Eichmann's bureaucratic efficiency brought us, but still an Orwellian future that must be avoided at all costs.  Peter Ludlow is a professor of philosophy at Northwestern University and writes frequently on digital culture, hacktivism and the surveillance state.  An earlier version of this article used the wrong word to describe the conduct of individuals who conform to the rules of a system; it is prescribed, not proscribed.   "
Content Creators Use Piracy to Gauge Consumer Interest,"You would think that Netflix, HBO and the like don't think too highly of video piracy Web sites. After all, two of the biggest hits on Netflix - Orange Is the New Black, a show about a women locked up in prison, and House of Cards, about a conniving politician - are among the most pirated content online. HBO's Game of Thrones was the most pirated show of 2012. But last week, a senior Netflix executive said the company itself used pirating Web sites  - to determine the genre of new shows viewers might be interested in, and the type of content Netflix produces or licenses.  ""With the purchase of a series, we look at what does well on piracy sites,"" Kelly Merryman, vice president of content acquisition at Netflix, told the Web site Tweakers, a Netherlands-based news outlet. ""Prison Break"" is exceptionally popular on piracy sites,"" Ms. Merryman said, while noting that this was part of the reason Netflix decided to license the show. While piracy proponents have been arguing that companies should embrace illegal downloads for some time, it seems that companies like Netflix are finally agreeing. Laurence H. Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School, said Netflix, HBO and others can gain important information on customers by paying attention to online pirates. ""I have little doubt that some companies are starting to see how they might benefit from the information they can reap by being subjected to online piracy,"" Mr. Tribe said in an interview. ""Whether they see those benefits as large enough to offset their losses discounted by the high costs of constructing sufficiently strong anti-piracy protections is likely to be a function of a hard-headed, context-based cost-benefit calculation framed by imagination."" In the past Reed Hastings, Netflix's chief executive, has seemed nonplussed by the reality that people illegally download shows from his company. ""Certainly there is some Torrenting that goes on and that's true around the world, but some of that just creates the demand,"" Mr. Hastings told Tweakers in an interview when asked how he feels about people pirating content on the site. ""Netflix is so much easier than Torrenting."" In the interview, Mr. Hastings implied that pirating builds demand, and then when the service becomes available in a new country, people switch to the easier, paid product. ""In Canada BitTorrent is down by as much as 50 percent since Netflix launched three years ago,"" he said. It seems that Netflix isn't alone in lauding piracy Web sites, or at least nodding to the importance of them as a barometer for the public's interest in a show. Earlier this year Time Warner's chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, said on an earnings call that pirated content can be ""a tremendous word-of-mouth thing."" While talking about HBO's Game of Thrones, Mr. Bewkes said the discovery that the show was the most pirated TV brand of 2012 could be ""better than an Emmy."" Even the music industry is learning that piracy can pay. According to a study issued in March by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, a scientific and technical arm of the European Commission, illegal downloads of songs do very little to harm music industry sales. The study of 16,000 Europeans found that ""piracy can actually provide a boost to music revenues online, irrespective of the genre, and that it should not be viewed as a pressing issue by the industry at all."" In many instances, the study found, if the music was available in a digital form for a fee people would be willing to pay for it. This is the same reality HBO and Netflix seems to be learning, too. Of course, as I've noted before, some of this could be content producers choosing to throw their hands in the air when it comes to illegal downloads. Stopping online piracy is like playing the world's largest game of Whac-A-Mole.  "
A Call for New Laws in New York to Fight High-Tech Crime,"New York State, failing to keep pace with technological change and increasingly sophisticated economic crimes, needs to update its laws to help authorities prosecute white-collar wrongdoing, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr.  In the 112-page report, a white-collar crime task force made a number of proposals, including strengthening the laws against identity theft and the stealing of computer code. New York's penal laws have changed little since 1965, Mr. Vance said, leaving laws against electronic crimes outmoded. Mr. Vance and federal prosecutors in Manhattan have made the prosecution of corporate espionage and high-tech theft a top priority. ""The Internet has become our 21st-century crime scene,"" Mr. Vance said at the Center for the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University, where he unveiled the report. ""Serious computer and related crimes are not today treated according to the gravity and breadth of the harm caused."" Mr. Vance's office is prosecuting Sergey Aleynikov, a former programmer at Goldman Sachs accused of stealing secret code from the bank. Mr. Aleynikov, who has denied the accusations, was charged in state court less than six months after a federal appeals court overturned his conviction on federal criminal charges related to the same crime. Also on Tuesday, Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, discussed his office's actions to prevent high-frequency traders from getting advance looks at potentially market-moving information. Speaking at the Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit in New York, Mr. Schneiderman criticized the data provider Thomson Reuters for allowing customers to pay it a premium to obtain the results early of the influential University of Michigan consumer confidence survey. Calling the practice ""Insider Trading 2.0,"" he said those types of arrangements were ""far more insidious than traditional insider trading."" The New York State task force focused on more than just insider trading, examining a range of white-collar crime like fraud aimed at the elderly, tax fraud and counterfeiting. It proposed changes to enhance money laundering laws, such as criminalizing the structuring of cash transactions to avoid a reporting requirement. Formed in October, the task force was led by the District Attorneys Association of the State of New York and co-headed by Daniel R. Alonso, the chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan. A group of prominent white-collar criminal defense lawyers worked on the report, including David B. Anders of Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, Steven M. Cohen of Zuckerman Spaeder and Karen Patton Seymour of Sullivan & Cromwell. The task force will present the recommendations to the Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. ""These new breeds of white-collar crime have victimized individuals, businesses, and government entities alike,"" said the report. ""Despite its multifarious forms, all modern white-collar crime in New York shares one feature: it costs our taxpayers dearly.""  William Alden contributed reporting.   "
LinkedIn's New Mobile App Called 'a Dream for Attackers',"Security researchers are calling LinkedIn's new mobile app, Intro, a dream come true for hackers or intelligence agencies. ""I'm flabbergasted by this,"" Richard Bejtlich, the chief research officer at the computer security company Mandiant, said in an interview on Wednesday. ""I can't believe someone thought this was a good idea."" Intro is an e-mail plug-in for iOS users that pulls LinkedIn profile information into e-mails so that the sender's job title appears front-and-center in e-mails on a user's iPhone or iPad.  Some bloggers have hailed it as a smart play by LinkedIn to get more mobile action and to get users to stop thinking of the service as a static Web site they go to every couple of years to update their employment status. But security researchers have taken issue with the way the app works. Intro redirects e-mail traffic to and from users' iPhones and iPads through LinkedIn's servers, then analyzes and scrapes those e-mails for relevant data and adds pertinent LinkedIn details. Researchers liken that redirection to a so-called man-in-the-middle attack in which hackers, or more recently, intelligence agencies, intercept Internet traffic en route to its destination and do what they will with it.Iranian hackers used that tactic to intercept dissidents' Gmail accounts in 2011, by hacking into DigiNotar, a Dutch certificate authority. The National Security Agency is accused of using man-in-the-middle attack tactics to snoop on Google traffic, according to recent revelations by Edward Snowden. Security researchers say LinkedIn essentially does the same thing in the name of a new mobile feature. "" 'But that sounds like a man-in-the-middle attack!"" I hear you cry,' "" Bishop Fox, a security consulting group wrote in a blog post. ""Yes. Yes it does. Because it is. That's exactly what it is. And this is a bad thing. If your employees are checking their company email, it's an especially bad thing."" LinkedIn has responded to some of those concerns in an amended blog post Thursday. The company notes that customers have to opt in to the app and that, once they do, their e-mail is encrypted to and from LinkedIn's servers. The company also notes that LinkedIn does not store any e-mail on its servers. But researchers note that in order for LinkedIn to stick changes into an e-mail, they have to decrypt it and then encrypt it again en route to its recipient, adding a new layer of insecurity to e-mail in transit. ""I worry LinkedIn is not going to treat this as the holy grail for people's e-mail, even though it is,"" said Mr. Bejtlich. ""The risk is that you essentially trust a box, run by LinkedIn, with your e-mail. It's a target for someone that wants to get to your e-mail. All the fears people now have about e-mail - that they will be intercepted by intelligence agencies for instance - are present."" LinkedIn has not had the best security profile. After the service was hacked last year, six million user passwords popped up on a Russian message board, revealing that the company used only bare basic security protocols. And last month, the company became the target of a class-action suit by users who said it was improperly accessing their data. Bishop Fox, the security consulting firm, called the app ""a dream for attackers"" and enumerated specific concerns in a blog post. Among them: By giving LinkedIn access to their e-mails, users may be waiving their rights to attorney-client privilege. The consultancy also warned users that by opting into Intro, they may be ""in gross violation"" of their employer's security policies. ""I don't think people who use this are seriously thinking about the implications of LinkedIn seeing and changing their e-mail,"" notes Mr. Bejtlich. ""These changes are done in the name of a feature, or speed, but it just completely breaks the idea that e-mail traffic is going where it should go and no place else.""  "
New Twist in War Between Industrial Heavyweights,"The war between China's two biggest heavy-equipment makers is now entering business lore as an epic struggle, one involving false financial reports, defamation in the news media and cyberespionage. This conflict, pitting Sany Heavy Industry Company against Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and Technology Development Company, both based in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, has gone on for years, and it has never been an easy one to untangle. But last month, the conflict came under its greatest scrutiny to date, thanks to the strange episode involving Chen Yongzhou. Mr. Chen is a journalist who, in police custody, made a televised confession saying that he had accepted bribes to smear Zoomlion in false and malicious articles published by his newspaper, New Express. Mr. Chen and state news media reports did not say who had paid the bribes, but suspicion immediately fell on Sany. Screenshots circulating online of the police video showed Mr. Chen signing a confession that had Sany's name in the text.  This week, Caixin, a respected investigative magazine, published a cover story that provided salacious details on the convoluted history of Sany versus Zoomlion, which it called in its headline a ""dirty clash."" Sany is a private company whose founder and chairman, Liang Wengen, was named in 2011 as China's richest man by both Forbes, which estimated his wealth at $9.3 billion, and by the Hurun Rich List, which put his wealth at $10.7 billion. Zoomlion is partly owned by the Hunan provincial government, and the company's chairman, Zhan Chunxin, was once deputy director of the provincial government agency that was the precursor to Zoomlion. The Caixin article says the rivalry between the two companies intensified starting in 2005, when both of their revenues and profits soared. The flashpoints between the two have been numerous and colorful: Mysterious text messages sent to customers about defective products; the attempted kidnapping of Mr. Liang's son in 2010; an effort by Sany to make an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2011 that was scuttled by shadowy Internet reports that Sany had bribed government officials. In November last year, Mr. Liang announced plans to move Sany's headquarters to Beijing, citing a bad competitive environment in Hunan. Mr. Zhan said the statements were defamatory, and the Caixin article cited company reports showing that Sany received far more in government subsidies in 2011 and 2012 than Zoomlion did. Both companies had gotten substantial support from the Hunan government in financing, land and policies, Caixin reported. I first looked into the competition between the two companies last spring while reporting for a story on the culture of hacking in China. One episode that the Caixin article did not address was a case last year that involved hacking and cyberespionage, a growing practice among Chinese companies. Xinhua, the state-run news agency, reported in November 2012 that the police had arrested two employees in Sany's marketing department, a Zoomlion employee and two other ""relevant people"" on charges of corporate espionage. They were accused of being paid by Sany to spy on Zoomlion. Mr. Liang, the chairman of Sany, gave an interview to the Chinese magazine Global Entrepreneur late last year in which he accused Zoomlion of secretly recording Sany's meetings, bribing local officials, spreading malicious rumors about Sany and plotting to kidnap his son. Zoomlion denied the accusations. Last March, I sat down at a cafe in Beijing with a former hacker who had firsthand knowledge of the cyberespionage case. He explained it to me in the context of discussing the mercenary nature of Chinese hackers today. This former hacker now worked in corporate cybersecurity, and he said he knew the middleman who had hired the two cyberspies for Sany. (They might have been the two ""relevant people"" mentioned in the earlier Xinhua report.) The middleman, who had been detained temporarily by the police, was also a security engineer, and he had now been shamed within the industry. ""He's very embarrassed by this,"" the former hacker told me. ""He's so young and was under a lot of pressure to make money,"" the former hacker said. The middleman had bought two apartments in Beijing, he said, and needed to meet mortgage payments. ""As long as the risk was low and there was a moral gray area, he thought he could use his connections in this world to make a little bit of money here, a little bit of money there,"" the former hacker said. ""He didn't have a moral bottom line. We jokingly call these people pimps."" ""The thing is, a lot of people who work in security today are also suffering from a moral vacuum,"" he said. ""They don't have any guidance or a strong value system. They don't know where their bottom line is. I don't see this as a political problem. I see this as a money issue."" Those words describe far more than just the world of hackers in China, as both the episode involving Mr. Chen, the fallen journalist, and the history of the wider war between Sany and Zoomlion have shown. Another former hacker, one who used the alias ""V8 Brother"" for the purposes of our interview, tried explaining to me why hacking for profit had spread so quickly in recent years, and it seemed that the two reasons he cited could also apply to shortcomings in the cultures of Chinese officials and corporate executives. ""The first is lack of law - China has only been a country for less than 100 years,"" he said. ""And the social environment makes it hard to make money through honest work.""

Illegal Video Downloads Continue Upward Trajectory,"There are some lists where you don't want to be crowned as the winner: most likely not to succeed, for example, or most boring person of the year. And if you own a company that makes and sells TV shows, having one of your creations at the top of the Most Pirated Show on Television list probably isn't something you'd stick on your fridge. In a report released this week by Torrent Freak, a blog that covers copyright and BitTorrent-related news, the hit HBO fantasy series ""Game of Thrones"" won the seat on the Iron Throne for being the most pirated television show in 2013. This shouldn't come as a surprise to HBO. The company won the same award in 2012.  But HBO is far from alone. According to a piracy study released in September by NetNames, a British-based digital research firm that was commissioned by NBC Universal to explore piracy online, 2013 was a banner year for illegal downloads. The piracy report noted that 327 million unique Internet users explicitly sought to download copyrighted content in January 2013 - 10 percent more than 15 months earlier - clicking on 13.9 billion web pages focused on pirated content. The piracy report noted that this was all part of a continued and growing pattern. From 2010 to 2012, the report said, the amount of Internet bandwidth used for copyright infringement in North America, Europe and Asia grew by 160 percent, or from 3,690 petabytes to 9,567 petabytes of illegally downloaded content. (A single petabyte is equal to 13.3 years of HD-video.) Downloading that content accounted for 24 percent of all Internet bandwidth from those regions.  As I've written in the past, when it comes to HBO's content, only cable subscribers can get access to HBO Go, the company's digital download service. That tight access seems to push fans of the show to either borrow passwords for HBO Go or steal the show from file-sharing sites. As my colleague Dave Itzkoff noted on Arts Beat, ""fans of""Game of Thrones"" are so eager for the murder, villainy, depravity and wedding banquets gone horribly wrong depicted on that series that they don't mind engaging in a little piracy to see the show."" HBO did not respond to a request for comment about continued and growing illegal downloads of its shows. As a result of the passionate demand for the show, the most popular episode of ""Game of Thrones"" in 2013 was downloaded 5.9 million times, up from 4.28 million the year before, according to Torrent Freak. By comparison, each first-run broadcast of the show drew about 5 million viewers this season. The season finale this year was also shared by more than 170,000 people simultaneously, breaking previous records for simultaneous downloads of any show. torrentfreak.com But while many of the trend lines around pirated content remained the same this year, there was one stark difference: Some content creators finally admitted that illegal downloads aren't all bad. In September, a senior Netflix executive said the company used pirating websites to determine the genre of new shows viewers might be interested in. ""With the purchase of a series, we look at what does well on piracy sites,"" said Kelly Merryman, vice president of content acquisition at Netflix. HBO also acknowledged that piracy can be great free advertising. Time Warner's chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, said on an earnings call that pirated content can be ""a tremendous word-of-mouth thing."" And David Petrarca, the director of Game of Thrones, said during a panel discussion at Perth's Writers Festival, that theft can create ""cultural buzz"" around a show that traditional methods can not. Those statements seemed like a breath of fresh air. Content companies like HBO could probably do more to decrease illegal downloads, namely by giving consumers more legal access points to shows. But but doing that, the companies would probably lose out on some of the underground attention that they also value.  "
Trial Begins for Scotland Yard Officer in Phone-Hacking Scandal,"LONDON -- In the first of a number of high-profile trials expected this year in cases of alleged criminal wrongdoing at Britain's freewheeling newspapers, a high-ranking Scotland Yard officer went on trial on Monday, charged with seeking to sell confidential police information to a tabloid that Rupert Murdoch ordered shut 18 months ago as the phone-hacking scandal erupted around his British newspaper empire. The case against the officer, Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, 53, stemmed from a telephone call in September 2010 in which, prosecutors say, she gave a reporter for The News of the World details of a newly reopened investigation into accusations of voice mail hacking by the tabloid. At the time of the call, Ms. Casburn was a senior officer in Scotland Yard's top-secret counterterrorism unit, code-named SO15.  With at least six separate inquiries into different aspects of the scandal, and a total of 180 police officers and officials assigned to the work, the overall police operation has been described by senior police officials as the most extensive -- and expensive -- criminal investigation in Scotland Yard's history. Altogether, more than 90 people have been arrested, though fewer than a dozen have been charged. Prosecutors have said that charges against others are likely to follow. Investigations that have turned up evidence of police wrongdoing, in the form of alleged payments and other benefits given by the tabloids to serving officers in return for confidential information, have been a factor in a battery of high-level resignations. Police commanders say progress in the investigations, and successful prosecutions, will be an important test for Scotland Yard, formally known as the Metropolitan Police Service, whose reputation has been badly battered by the scandal. In addition to corrupt payments to police and other public officials, the charges laid out so far by prosecutors include conspiracy to intercept cellphone messages, the touchstone of the investigations, involving hundreds of celebrities, politicians, sports stars and crime victims; and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by destroying or hiding evidence, including e-mails and other documents. Others facing trial this year include Andy Coulson, a News of the World editor who went on to become Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director at 10 Downing Street; Rebekah Brooks, a former editor of two Murdoch tabloids, The News of the World and The Sun, who resigned as the chief executive of News International, the Murdoch newspaper subsidiary in Britain, as the scandal unfolded in 2011; and Charlie Brooks, Ms. Brooks's husband, who is a prominent racehorse trainer and Eton College contemporary -- and friend -- of Mr. Cameron. The focus of the trial that began Monday was a nine-minute phone call that the defendant, Ms. Casburn, made to The News of the World when she was responsible for a Scotland Yard unit that tracked terrorist financing, an assignment she won partly because of her background in investment finance in the City of London. The prosecution says the call was prompted by a renewed investigation into the paper's involvement in phone hacking that had begun the previous day. The court was told that the new inquiry, by John Yates, one of Scotland Yard's top officers, had been ordered because of a magazine article detailing phone hacking by The News of the World that The New York Times had published 10 days earlier. The prosecutor, Mark Bryant-Heron, said Ms. Casburn had told one of the tabloid's reporters that Mr. Yates, then in charge of the Scotland Yard counterterrorism effort, was ''looking at six people'' as a result of the article. The two she named, the prosecutor said, were Mr. Coulson, the paper's former editor, and Sean Hoare, a former reporter who was named in the Times article as confirming that phone hacking was rife at the paper when he worked there. Mr. Hoare died in 2011. According to the prosecution's account, Ms. Casburn explained her motive for the call by telling the reporter, Tim Wood, that she objected to the diversion of Scotland Yard's counterterrorism resources to the phone-hacking inquiry and to the political pressure being brought to bear on Mr. Yates by John Prescott, a former deputy prime minister whose cellphone had been hacked. The court was told that the tabloid did not publish an article on the basis of Ms. Casburn's call and that no payment was made to her. In an e-mail to his editors cited in court, Mr. Wood said Ms. Casburn had asked to be paid, but the court was told that she had denied this in police interviews. On the stand, Mr. Wood seemed uncertain. While his ''recollection'' was ''not great,'' he said, Ms. Casburn ''must have said she wanted to be paid'' for him to have suggested that she had. "
Officer at Scotland Yard Is Guilty in Hacking Trial,"LONDON -- With a jury's unanimous guilty vote on Thursday, one of the most senior female officers at Scotland Yard became the first person to be convicted of a criminal offense in the phone hacking scandal that has enveloped Rupert Murdoch's newspaper empire in Britain over the past 30 months. The officer, Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, 53, was convicted of a single count of misconduct in public office after a three-day trial. The judge, Sir Adrian Fulford, warned Ms. Casburn that she faced ''a real possibility'' of a prison sentence, to be decided after he reviewed sentencing submissions from prosecuting and defense counsels in the case.  The verdict carried implications for a battery of other trials expected this year and next as prosecutors work their way through police files on more than 90 people who have been arrested in the scandal. In many of the cases, the individuals -- police officers, newspaper executives, editors, reporters and private investigators working for the newspapers -- have offered the same defense advanced by Ms. Casburn and her lawyers: that they were acting in the public interest. The case revolved around Ms. Casburn's telephone call to the Murdoch-owned News of the World tabloid on Sept. 11, 2010, in which she told a reporter details of a confidential new investigation into allegations that the paper had been involved in a widespread pattern of hacking into the cellphone messages of celebrities. Ms. Casburn maintained on the witness stand that she was motivated by her anger at a decision by her superiors to assign the new investigation to Scotland Yard's counterterrorism command, where she headed a unit responsible for investigating terrorist financing. She cited a strongly male bias within the counterterrorism unit, telling the court that there was a ''palpable excitement'' at the prospect of interviewing celebrities who had said that their phones had been hacked, including the actress Sienna Miller. ''I felt very strongly that we shouldn't be doing hacking,'' she said. ''Our function was to prevent terrorist attacks.'' The prosecution case, accepted by the jury, was that Ms. Casburn was acting out of personal motives, and had demanded payment in return for the confidential information. After the call, the reporter she spoke with, Tim Wood, wrote an e-mail to his editors, cited in evidence at the court, saying that the officer who called him ''wants to sell inside info'' on the new police inquiry. Ms. Casburn denied asking for payment. The investigation Ms. Casburn divulged had been reopened on the basis of a magazine article published in The New York Times, which quoted sources at The News of the World saying that hacking of cellphone messages had been rife. Their accounts contradicted an earlier Scotland Yard finding that the practice had been limited to a single ''rogue reporter'' and a private investigator, both of whom were sentenced to brief prison terms in 2007 for hacking into the cellphone messages of junior members of the royal family and their aides. By bringing Ms. Casburn to trial ahead of others who have been charged in the scandal, prosecutors appeared eager to show that Scotland Yard, the pinnacle of policing in Britain, was determined to uproot the wrongdoing in its own ranks exposed by the scandal. After Ms. Casburn's conviction, Scotland Yard, formally known as the Metropolitan Police Service, issued a statement saying: ''There may be occasions when putting certain information into the public domain -- so-called whistle-blowing -- can be justified. This was not one of them. Fortunately, this type of behavior is rare, but we hope today's verdict shows the public can have confidence that the M.P.S. holds itself to account.'' "
British Antiterrorism Official Sentenced in Hacking Scandal,"LONDON -- A senior police officer in Scotland Yard's counterterrorism command was sentenced to a 15-month prison term on Friday for seeking cash payments from Rupert Murdoch's News of the World tabloid in return for information about a Scotland Yard investigation into phone hacking at the paper.  A unanimous jury verdict after a four-day trial last month made Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, 53, the first person to be convicted of a criminal offense in the phone hacking scandal, which has enveloped Mr. Murdoch's newspaper domain in Britain for 30 months. The judge told Inspector Casburn that she would have drawn a three-year term if she did not have a 3-year-old child who was still moving through the adoption process. At the trial, the jury was told that evidence implicating Inspector Casburn was provided to Scotland Yard by an internal investigative unit, known as the management and standards committee, that was established by Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation as part of his pledge to give the police any incriminating information that it came across as it examined millions of e-mails and other documents relating to the hacking scandal. A spokesman for Scotland Yard said Inspector Casburn, who continued to draw her $102,000-a-year salary during the trial, would now face an internal dismissal procedure. In a statement after her sentencing, Scotland Yard said Inspector Casburn had ''betrayed the service and let down her colleagues.'' It said her prison term ''sends a strong message that the leaking of confidential information for personal gain is absolutely unacceptable and will not be tolerated.'' Inspector Casburn, who was impassive as the judge pronounced sentence, had told the court that she had telephoned The News of the World in September 2010 because she was angry that her superiors had decided to divert money and resources from counterterrorism operations to the phone hacking scandal, and thought that she was acting in the public interest. "
Six More Journalists Held in British Hacking Case,"LONDON -- Adding momentum to police investigations that have already cost Rupert Murdoch's newspaper empire in Britain hundreds of millions of dollars, Scotland Yard said Wednesday that six more journalists who previously worked for The News of the World were arrested at dawn on suspicion of hacking into cellphone messages. The latest police swoop followed others in the past year that have resulted in the arrests of more than 100 reporters, editors, investigators, executives and public officials by police units investigating whether criminal activity occurred at British newspapers. Most of those have involved The Sun, Mr. Murdoch's daily tabloid, and The News of the World, the highly profitable Sunday tabloid he shut down as the scandal broke in July 2011.  In an especially troublesome development for News Corporation, the New York-based parent company of the Murdoch newspapers in Britain, a statement on the latest arrests said they involved ''a further suspected conspiracy to intercept telephone voice mail messages by a number of employees who worked for the now defunct News of the World newspaper'' -- in effect, a new break in the police inquiry, involving possible wrongdoing beyond the wide pattern of phone hacking at the paper that has resulted in 32 arrests so far. The police statement said five of the arrests on Wednesday took place in London, and one in Cheshire, a county south of the northern city of Manchester. It said those held for questioning were three men and three women, all in their 30s and 40s, none of whom were identified. The Sun later confirmed that two of the six were currently working for the newspaper, having taken jobs there after The News of the World closed. The police said the homes of all those arrested were being searched. Mike Darcey, chief executive of News International, the Murdoch subsidiary that publishes The Sun, e-mailed employees at the paper after the arrests. ''As always, I share your concerns about these arrests and recognize the huge burden it places on our journalists in the daily challenge of producing Britain's most popular newspaper,'' he said. ''I am extremely grateful to all of you who succeed in that mission despite these very challenging circumstances.'' Scotland Yard gave no details of the conspiracy that it contended was behind Wednesday's arrests, beyond saying that the ''new lines of inquiry'' it was pursuing involved offenses committed in 2005 and 2006. That would place the activity in the same period as the only hacking case against the Murdoch papers that has resulted in convictions so far. In 2007, The News of the World's royalty editor, Clive Goodman, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, were convicted and jailed -- Mr. Goodman for four months and Mr. Mulcaire for six months -- after they pleaded guilty to hacking into voice mail messages of members of the royal family. At the time of the Goodman-Mulcaire trial, Murdoch executives in Britain described the hacking of the royal telephones as a ''rogue'' incident and not part of a broader pattern of newsroom wrongdoing. But a different picture emerged after the police reopened the inquiry in 2011. Subsequently, hundreds of individuals, including celebrities, politicians, sports figures and crime victims, were informed that their phone messages had been intercepted, and many of them sued the Murdoch papers for damages and demanded public apologies. Once the phone hacking scandal broke, the police inquiry widened to include allegations of bribing public officials, computer hacking and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by concealing or destroying evidence. Sixty arrests -- by far the largest number -- have involved conspiracies to bribe police officers and public officials to obtain confidential information on which to build the newspapers' scoops. Last week, a London court was told that 144 of 169 civil suits filed against The News of the World by victims of the phone hacking had been settled out of court and that substantial but undisclosed damages had been paid to the litigants. Those named as having settled their claims included Hugh Grant, the actor; Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York; Uri Geller, the magician; Richard Reardon, a priest who has ministered to the singer Charlotte Church; and an array of minor television and film celebrities. A lawyer for the hacking victims told the court that 26 damage suits remained active, and that up to 100 new cases were likely to reach the court before News International, the Murdoch newspaper subsidiary in Britain, closes a compensation offer to all phone hacking victims in April. The highest-known settlement paid by the company, amounting to about $1.2 million, was paid in 2008 to Gordon Taylor, chief executive of Britain's soccer players' union, the Professional Footballers' Association. In an action separate from the arrests of the six journalists on Wednesday, Scotland Yard said a 50-year-old police officer had been arrested at his home in south London by detectives investigating bribes to public officials. The officer was the 60th person to be arrested under a police inquiry set up as part of the wider investigation of newsroom wrongdoing. Several police officers are facing criminal corruption charges, but the most serious case before the courts so far involves a Defense Ministry official, Bettina Jordan-Barber, who has been charged, along with Rebekah Brooks, a former editor of The News of the World and The Sun, and John Kay, chief reporter for The Sun, with conspiracy to pay Ms. Jordan-Barber the equivalent of $160,000 for confidential information. Scotland Yard's hacking investigation has resulted in 32 arrests, including the six on Wednesday. Twenty others have been questioned in connection with computer hacking and other privacy breaches. "
Talks in Britain on Press Regulation Break Down,"LONDON -- Prime Minister David Cameron announced on Thursday that cross-party talks with other political leaders on regulating Britain's rambunctious press had broken down and that he would pursue his own proposal for a system of self-regulation after months of inquiries into the phone hacking scandal, mainly at Rupert Murdoch's tabloid newspapers here. Mr. Cameron's abrupt move placed new strains on his relationship with the Liberal Democrats, the junior coalition partner with his Conservative Party, and raised the possibility that Liberal Democrats might end up voting with the Labour opposition against Mr. Cameron's proposal for a royal charter to underpin a new self-regulatory body.  The prime minister's action also underscored the divisiveness of the debate about press regulation, at present supervised by a self-regulatory body generally seen as a feeble restraint on newspapers with a reputation for a headlong pursuit of scoops and a frequent disregard for the privacy of politicians, celebrities and others. In November, after months of hearings, a long-awaited report on the behavior of British newspapers embroiled in the phone hacking scandal, written by Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson, recommended that press regulation be backed by parliamentary statute, curbing Britain's 300-year-old tradition of broad press freedom. The Leveson inquiry was established after the hacking scandal peaked in July 2011. At that time, Mr. Murdoch ordered the closing of The News of the World, a flagship Sunday tabloid, after disclosures of widespread hacking, including the cellphone of Milly Dowler, a kidnapped schoolgirl who was later found murdered. The crisis led to civil suits, criminal investigations, a parliamentary inquiry and the Leveson hearings -- scrutiny that coursed through British public life, exposing previously hidden relationships between the press, the police and politicians. The affair has cost Mr. Murdoch's newspapers hundreds of millions of dollars. Six more journalists who previously worked for The News of the World were arrested in February on suspicion of hacking into cellphone messages, adding to a tally of more than 100 reporters, editors, investigators, executives and public officials implicated in wrongdoing by police units investigating accusations of criminal activity. The scandal spread on Thursday to the rival Mirror Group, when the police said that four of the group's journalists had been arrested in south London on suspicion of ''conspiracy to intercept telephone communications.'' The journalists were not identified by name. Scotland Yard said they were three men ages 40, 46 and 49, and a 47-year-old woman. British news reports said the four were all senior serving or former editors, including the editor and deputy editor of the tabloid Sunday People and the former editor and former deputy editor of the tabloid Sunday Mirror. When the Leveson inquiry published its report calling for statutory underpinning to a new press watchdog, Mr. Cameron opposed the idea while Labour supported it. Instead, Mr. Cameron proposed that a new self-regulatory agency with the power to fine newspapers and take other measures to support victims of press intrusion into their privacy should be supported by a royal charter, a device used to give authority to and define the rights of major institutions like the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Bank of England. Mr. Cameron plans to call a vote on his proposal in Parliament on Monday, but Liberal Democrat officials said it was unclear how the junior coalition partner would vote. The Press Association news agency quoted Liberal Democrat officials as saying that Mr. Cameron had called off the talks with their leader, Nick Clegg, and the Labour opposition leader, Ed Miliband, ''unilaterally.'' ''We were very surprised and disappointed,'' an unidentified Liberal Democrat official was quoted as saying. ''We thought we were making real progress and inching toward a deal, but the prime minister has unilaterally decided to pull the plug on cross-party talks.'' Mr. Clegg did not say which way his followers would vote on Monday. ''Clearly, there are several days to go before votes are held,'' he was quoted as saying, ''and in those days I will be working flat-out speaking to other politicians from other parties to make sure that, whatever David Cameron has decided, that we nonetheless work together to get a proper solution to this difficult problem.'' ''Clearly I don't agree with David Cameron's approach, because I don't think it goes far enough to make sure that we deliver on the central recommendations of the Leveson report.'' At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Cameron said his proposal would create ''the toughest regulation of the press that this country has ever seen.'' Newspapers, he said, would refuse to accept regulation by parliamentary statute -- an idea supported by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and privacy campaigners. ''There's no point in producing a system that the press won't take part in,'' Mr. Cameron said. ''As prime minister, I wouldn't be fulfilling my duty if I came up with something knowing that it wouldn't work.'' "
News Corp. in $139 Million Settlement With Shareholders,"As News Corporation continues to negotiate settlements with victims of a phone-hacking scandal within its British newspaper division, its board on Monday reached a $139 million settlement with a group of United States shareholders.  The group had asserted that News Corporation's board -- led by Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive -- breached its fiduciary responsibility in handling the crisis in Britain. The lawsuit also asserted that the company unethically paid $670 million in 2011 to acquire the Shine Group, the television production company of Mr. Murdoch's daughter, Elisabeth Murdoch. The suit was filed by Amalgamated Bank, the largest union-owned bank in the United States, which handles large-scale labor and pension funds. News Corporation will not pay any of the $139 million settlement. Rather, the company will receive a payment from insurance that protects corporate boards from this type of litigation. ''We are proud of this historic settlement,'' Edward Grebow, president and chief executive of Amalgamated Bank, said in a statement. The bank's Longview Funds hold 455,343 Class A common shares of News Corporation. News Corporation indicated that the settlement would move it one step closer toward distancing itself from the hacking imbroglio that erupted in 2011. ''We are pleased to have resolved this matter,'' News Corporation said in a statement. ''The agreement reflects the important steps News Corporation has taken over the last year to strengthen our corporate governance and compliance structure,'' the statement added. News Corporation has invested in building a compliance structure that will appease the Justice Department ahead of a meeting later this month to discuss phone hacking and bribery at its British papers. In late June, the company is expected to split off its publishing assets -- including its British newspaper arm -- into a separate, publicly traded company. Entertainment and television assets like Fox Broadcasting and Fox News will form a separate company called 21st Century Fox. "
Britain: Not-Guilty Pleas in Hacking,"LONDON -- Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's newspaper operations in Britain, appeared in court on Wednesday and denied charges relating to the country's phone hacking scandal, which has sent shock waves through the press, the police and the political establishment.  In Southwark Crown Court in London, Ms. Brooks, 45, entered a plea of not guilty to five charges, including conspiracies to hack phones, to commit misconduct in public office and to pervert the course of justice. Five other former employees of News International, the British subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, as well as Ms. Brooks's husband, Charlie, also appeared in court and entered pleas of not guilty to various charges. The arraignment was the latest chapter in an unfolding drama that led to the closing of Mr. Murdoch's News of the World tabloid in July 2011 after accusations that its reporters had hacked into the voice mail of a kidnapped teenager, Milly Dowler, who was later found murdered. The scandal mushroomed into bribery investigations involving police officers and public officials. A panel of inquiry set up by Parliament urged that British press regulations be enshrined into law to prevent a recurrence of the scandal. Ms. Brooks, with her connections to the political elite, including Prime Minister David Cameron, has been closely watched throughout the scandal. A former editor of both The News of the World and The Sun, Ms. Brooks has been accused of conspiracy to hack phones between 2000 and 2006 and conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office between 2004 and 2012. She is also accused of seeking to pervert the course of justice by conspiring with her personal assistant to spirit material away from police investigators in July 2011. Ms. Brooks, Mr. Brooks and four other former News International employees were accused of seeking to pervert the course of justice.

Britain: Not-Guilty Plea in Hacking Case,"LONDON -- Andy Coulson, formerly a close aide to Prime Minister David Cameron and senior editor in Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper outpost, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges relating to the phone hacking scandal that spread turmoil among journalists, politicians and police officers.  Mr. Coulson's appearance at Southwark Crown Court in London came a day after Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's newspaper operations in Britain, appeared in the same court and denied five charges relating to the scandal. The two former editors were among several ex-employees of Mr. Murdoch's News International, a subsidiary of the giant News Corporation, based in New York, who have been formally arraigned over the past two days pending trials expected to start later in the year. All have denied wrongdoing. Mr. Coulson, 45, a former editor of the now-shuttered News of the World who went on to become Mr. Cameron's communications director, faced one charge on Thursday of conspiring to intercept voice mails between 2000 and 2006, and two other charges relating to payments to public officials in return for information at various dates between 2002 and 2005. On Wednesday Ms. Brooks, 45, entered a plea of not guilty to five charges, including conspiracies to hack phones, to commit misconduct in public office and to pervert the course of justice. Five other former employees of News International, the British subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, as well as Ms. Brooks's husband, Charlie, also appeared in court and entered pleas of not guilty to various charges.

A Scandal-Scalded Murdoch as a Song-and-Dance Man,"It has been an eventful couple of years for Rupert Murdoch. In Britain, evidence that reporters at several of his newspapers routinely hacked into private cellphones as they pursued hot stories led to the demise of News of the World, one of his mightiest tabloids, and incited an official government inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press. Last June, Mr. Murdoch announced that he was divorcing his third wife, Wendi Deng, whom he married in 1999. And now, with Australia in the midst of a federal election campaign, Mr. Murdoch, a harsh critic of the incumbent Labor Party and the owner of 70 percent of the country's newspapers, is once again the topic of the day in his native land.  The dramatists have taken note. Richard Bean, the author of ''One Man, Two Guvnors,'' is writing a play on the phone-hacking scandal for the National Theater in London at the invitation of its artistic director, Nicholas Hytner. Closer to home, the Melbourne Theater Company has just staged the premiere of ''Rupert,'' a cabaret-style dramatization of Mr. Murdoch's life by one of Australia's best-known playwrights, David Williamson. The play, which opened on Thursday at the Arts Center in Melbourne, uses two actors to play Murdoch. Guy Edmonds is the young Rupert. Sean O'Shea, appearing as Mr. Murdoch's 82-year-old self, also offers commentary and direction as the action unfolds -- very quickly to accommodate a career spanning more than six decades. Mr. Williamson, whose fiddling with the text and constant updating took him through 50 revisions, starts with Mr. Murdoch as the young heir to a failing Australian newspaper and follows him as he parlays success in Australia to tabloid triumphs in Britain, the purchase of The Times of London, and inroads into the United States. Little is left out, not even the shaving-cream pie that a comedian heaved at Mr. Murdoch when he appeared to testify before a parliamentary committee looking into the hacking scandal. The six other members of the ensemble cast take on multiple roles to populate an often crowded canvas. The reviews have been good, although critics hoping to see Mr. Murdoch's head served on a platter came away disappointed. The Age, Melbourne's non-Murdoch daily, praised Mr. O'Shea's portrayal of Mr. Murdoch as ''a roguish larrikin'' (Australian slang for a hooligan or rowdy) with a ''hint of menace beneath the charisma,'' while complaining that Mr. Williamson pulled too many punches. It was an open question how the Murdoch-owned papers would handle the subject. The Australian, a national daily owned by Mr. Murdoch, gave a more than respectful account of the play. Its reviewer complained that Mr. Williamson had tried to cram too many events into one evening's entertainment, but called the first act ''light and delightfully funny.'' Lee Lewis, the director, he wrote, ''sets a cracking pace, and her cast doesn't miss a beat.'' The hands-off approach to Mr. Murdoch was deliberate, Mr. Williamson said, part and parcel of his decision to depart from his more familiar naturalistic style and use the cabaret format. The Murdoch character ''invites the audience to see his real story,'' not the story from what a Murdoch paper might call ''effete caffe-latte-sipping inner-city left-liberal elites,'' Mr. Williamson said. ''He casts his own show so that the younger version of himself is considerably more handsome and dynamic than he was, but, as he tells his audience, this is his show, so he can do what he likes.'' Mr. Williamson is probably better known to American audiences as a screenwriter. He wrote the film version of his play ''Don's Party,'' directed by Bruce Beresford, and the screenplays for ''Gallipoli'' and ''The Year of Living Dangerously,'' both directed by Peter Weir. In Australia, where he first rose to prominence in the early 1970s, he is best known for satirical plays like ''The Removalists,'' ''The Perfectionist'' and Brilliant Lies,'' which he has turned out at the rate of nearly one a year. Brett Sheehy, the artistic director of the Melbourne Theater Company, approached Mr. Williamson a year and a half ago to write a play. ''I told him I'd love him to consider something which was a bit different from his usual work -- something which was thematically very global,'' Mr. Sheehy said. ''I asked him where was the heat and passion in discussions with his friends, at dinner parties, barbecues, get-togethers? He said: 'Oh God, that's easy. The power relationship between the media and politics. The News of the World troubles. The Leveson Inquiry.' '' Mr. Sheehy suggested that he take that as his subject, and splash it on a big canvas. ''Rupert immediately sprang to mind as a subject,'' Mr. Williamson said. ''He is the most powerful Australian or ex- Australian ever to have lived.'' A dramatic precursor immediately presented itself: Richard III. ''Both men, through a combination of boldness, ruthlessness, charm and steely ambition rose to rule their realms,'' Mr. Williamson said. ''Richard gets his comeuppance on Bosworth Field, but what's remarkable about Rupert is that he never does. The other difference, I guess, is that Richard killed many to get to the top. Rupert just fires anyone who doesn't toe the ideological line.'' As a dramatic figure, Mr. Murdoch has already made his debut on the stage, as the thinly disguised press baron Lambert Le Roux in ''Pravda,'' David Hare and Howard Brenton's 1985 satire about the British newspaper industry. Anthony Hopkins took the role. In ''Selling Hitler,'' a 1991 British television mini-series about the Hitler diaries hoax, Barry Humphries acted the part of Mr. Murdoch, whose newspaper The Sunday Times (in London) ran excerpts from the fake diaries. In an interview with The Age, Mr. Bean described his play in progress as ''funny but grotesque,'' and, in an adjectival pileup, a ''state of the nation, press, politics and police in bed with each other'' play. Mr. Murdoch was invited to ''Rupert,'' but has not responded. A theater spokeswoman said that members of his extended family were expected. The play is to come to Washington in March for five performances at the International Theater Festival. Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Wednesday with an article about ''Rupert,'' a cabaret-style dramatization of the life of Rupert Murdoch staged by the Melbourne Theater Company in Australia, misstated the setting of the scene shown in which the character playing Mr. Murdoch is about to be hit by a shaving-cream pie. It is during a family argument, not when he arrives to testify before a parliamentary panel. (In 2011 a protester attacked Mr. Murdoch with a plate filled with shaving cream during a hearing at the British Parliament.) "
Britain: Publisher May Be Held Liable Over Phone Hacking,"LONDON -- Britain's phone hacking scandal advanced closer to another leading newspaper group on Thursday when Trinity Mirror said the police were investigating whether the company was criminally liable for allegations of ''unlawful conduct'' by previous employees of the Sunday Mirror tabloid.  ''The group does not accept wrongdoing within its business and takes these allegations seriously,'' Trinity Mirror, which also publishes the left-leaning Daily Mirror tabloid and Sunday People, said in a statement. ''It is too soon to know how these matters will progress, and further updates will be made if there are any significant developments.'' In March, the police said that four Mirror group journalists had been arrested in South London on suspicion of conspiracy to intercept telephone communications. The journalists were not identified by name. Scotland Yard said they were three men ages 40, 46 and 49, and a 47-year-old woman. British news reports at the time said the four were all senior current or former editors, including the editor and deputy editor of the tabloid Sunday People and the former editor and former deputy editor of The Sunday Mirror. Thursday's announcement indicates that the police are also investigating whether the employer of the arrested journalists bears corporate responsibility for any wrongdoing. The hacking scandal has largely embroiled British newspapers in Rupert Murdoch's empire. In July 2011, Mr. Murdoch closed The News of the World, a tabloid, after disclosures that its employees had hacked into the cellphone messages of a teenager, Milly Dowler, who had been abducted and was later found murdered. Two former editors and several ex-employees of Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper subsidiary have been charged and trials are expected to start later in the year. All have denied wrongdoing. The hacking scandal led to an array of investigations, one of which, the Leveson inquiry, concluded that Britain needed a new form of press oversight with statutory underpinnings. One of the witnesses at the inquiry, led by Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson, was the CNN talk show host Piers Morgan, who was editor of The Daily Mirror from 1995 to 2004. He told the investigation that he knew no one who hacked phones. Other witnesses testified that phone hacking was rife at The Mirror, but Mr. Morgan repeatedly testified that it was not and that he knew nothing about it. The Sunday Mirror, according to recent industry statistics, had a circulation of around one million in August, but The Sun on Sunday, which replaced the shuttered News of the World, led the Sunday tabloid market with sales of 1.9 million, followed by The Mail on Sunday with around 1.6 million. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Establishing a Relationship,"LONDON -- A high-profile phone hacking trial in Britain turned considerably seamier on Thursday when the prosecution revealed in court that the two most senior editors of the tabloid The News of the World had an affair lasting more than six years -- during the period at issue in the trial, and also while both of them married other people. The two editors, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, are defendants in the case surrounding the British newspapers controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation empire, including The News of the World, a weekly that the company shut down in 2011 after the hacking scandal broke.  Ms. Brooks was the editor of The News of the World from 2000 to 2003 and then moved to its sister daily tabloid, The Sun; Mr. Coulson was her deputy at the weekly and succeeded her as its editor, running the paper until 2007. Andrew Edis, a prosecutor in the case, said in open court that the two began their six-year affair in 1998; Mr. Coulson married in 2000, and Ms. Brooks married in 2002. Mr. Coulson remains married; Ms. Brooks was divorced in 2009, and then she married her current husband, Charlie Brooks, who is also a defendant in the case. The prosecutor said the Brooks-Coulson affair ended long before Mr. Coulson went to work for Prime Minister David Cameron after his election in 2010. The prosecutor's revelation made it legally permissible to publish reports of the affair, which had been widely discussed in private by journalists. Mr. Edis justified the revelation by saying it demonstrated the closeness of the two, who are charged with overseeing a pattern of phone hacking and other illegal efforts to obtain details of the lives of prominent people. The targets of the hacking ranged from politicians and socialites to Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old who was abducted in 2002 and later found dead. The paper broke into her voice mail account while she was missing, to listen to messages left for her by her parents. The paper also hacked the phones of competing journalists. ''Throughout the relevant period, what Mr. Coulson knew, Mrs. Brooks knew, too,'' Mr. Edis said. ''What Mrs. Brooks knew, Mr. Coulson knew, too. That's the point.'' He argued that none of the illegal acts undertaken by the paper's journalists or the freelancers it hired were likely to have been unknown to the top editors, and that they were unlikely to have kept such secrets from one another. The relationship came to the attention of the police when investigators found a letter addressed to Mr. Coulson at Ms. Brooks's home, written in February 2004 when Mr. Coulson was trying to end the affair. ''The fact is you are my very best friend, I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you, we laugh and cry together,'' the letter said, as Mr. Edis read it in court. ''Without our relationship in my life, I am not sure I will cope.'' Mr. Edis asserted that he was not trying to embarrass the two defendants, to intrude into their private lives or to make a moral judgment. ''Mrs. Brooks and Mr. Coulson are charged with conspiracy and, when people are charged with conspiracy, the first question a jury has to answer is, How well did they know each other? How much did they trust each other?'' he said. ''And the fact that they were in this relationship, which was a secret, means that they trusted each other quite a lot with at least that secret, and that's why we are telling you about it.'' The trial, with a total of eight defendants, is expected to last many months. Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson are accused of conspiring with others to hack phones and of conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office, a reference to payoffs made to the police and other officials. Ms. Brooks also faces charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Her husband is accused of helping her to hide evidence. All eight defendants deny the charges against them. On Wednesday, Mr. Edis revealed that four other people had pleaded guilty to having hacked phone accounts on behalf of The News of the World. He argued that the jury should consider those pleas as evidence of a conspiracy, and that senior editors must have been aware of the acts of underlings. ''They must have known where these stories came from, or they never would have got in the paper,'' he said. "
"Prince Harry Was Victim Of Hacking, Jury Is Told","LONDON -- The News of the World tabloid hacked into the cellphone of Prince Harry's private secretary, a former member of the military, in 2005 to write an article about how the prince had sought his secretary's help to prepare a term paper for officers' school at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, the jury in Britain's phone hacking trial heard on Friday.  The young prince was seeking help for a paper on the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege in London. He asked his private secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, a former Special Air Service officer who trained at Sandhurst: ''Just wondering if you have any info at all on siege on the Iranian Embassy because I need to write an essay quite quickly on that. I need some inf. Have most of the stuff but if you have extra.'' Help in doing academic work is a violation of academy rules, but there were few repercussions for the prince, now 29 and a helicopter gunner with the British Army. A prosecutor, Andrew Edis, read the transcript of the voice mail message and said the newspaper article was ''based entirely'' on it, although, he told the jury, the editors were careful that the article not be too specific, in an effort to disguise how the information had been obtained. The transcript was taken from Clive Goodman, the former royal editor of The News of the World, who was jailed over phone hacking in 2007 and lost his job. He apparently kept the document as part of a suit he filed against the newspaper, now defunct, in which he claimed that senior editors supported his actions. The message was taken from Mr. Lowther-Pinkerton's phone by a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, who was also jailed over phone hacking in 2007. He was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the newspaper and has pleaded guilty to additional charges of phone hacking. Mr. Edis, who is laying out the prosecution's case before presenting evidence, said Andy Coulson, one of the tabloid's senior editors, and Mr. Goodman had discussed how to publish the article about Prince Harry's seeking help from his secretary without revealing how they learned of it. They decided not to refer to the siege itself, because it would be ''too precise to get through unnoticed,'' the prosecutor said. Mr. Edis also said Mr. Coulson had emailed a journalist at the tabloid to order him to ''do'' a celebrity's phone, telling the jury that it would have to decide what the verb meant. The celebrity in question was the son of a famous soccer player, George Best. The prosecution is trying to prove that the eight defendants, among them Mr. Coulson and Rebekah Brooks, another senior editor at The News of The World, are guilty of crimes that include conspiracy to violate privacy and to suborn officials by paying them. In one instance, Mr. Coulson is said to have told Mr. Goodman to pay 1,000 pounds in cash to a policeman for a copy of the royal telephone directory. Mr. Edis claims that the acts of News of the World journalists could not have been unknown or unapproved by their senior editors. Journalists at the newspaper, he said, used phone hacking as a ''perfectly rational but entirely illegal'' way of finding and substantiating stories about the rich and famous. "
Britain: Prosecutor Says Tabloid Hacked Into Calls From a Prince,"LONDON -- A prosecutor in a high-profile trial on Thursday accused Rupert Murdoch's News of the World tabloid of hacking into the voice mail of the Duchess of Cambridge when she was known as Kate Middleton, before her marriage to Prince William, second in line to the throne. Transcripts read in court by the prosecutor, Andrew Edis, quoted the prince as saying ''Hi, baby, it's me'' in one voice mail message and referring to her as ''babykins.'' They also chronicled his admission that he was almost shot with blank rounds during a night navigation drill.  The recordings were discovered during a police investigation into phone hacking that convulsed Mr. Murdoch's British tabloid empire -- and much of the British press, the police and the political elite -- in 2011. Mr. Murdoch closed The News of the World that year after accusations that its reporters had hacked into the voice mail of a kidnapped teenager, Milly Dowler, who was later found murdered. Some of the recordings read out on Thursday were said to have been found in the home of Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator employed by The News of the World. He and Clive Goodman, the newspaper's former royal editor, served jail terms in 2007 for hacking royal aides' phones. The latest disclosure is certain to be seen as a bombshell as prosecutors press an array of charges against two former top Murdoch executives, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, and five other people. Past allegations of royal hacking have focused on the interception of their aides' voice mail messages. The prince's messages were said by the prosecution to have been intercepted in 2006, while William was attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, five years before his marriage. Mr. Edis said that a message left for Prince Harry, William's younger brother, had also been intercepted. Ms. Brooks, 45, a former top editor and executive at Mr. Murdoch's British newspapers, and Mr. Coulson, 45, who had also been an editor and went to become head of communications for Prime Minister David Cameron, have both denied conspiracy and other charges. Since her marriage to William, the Duchesss of Cambridge has frequently been referred to as a potential Queen of England, adding spice to the charges that her voice mail was hacked. Mr. Edis said The News of the World had run stories drawing on the phone intercepts. In one message, Prince William, now the Duke of Cambridge, was quoted as telling Ms. Middleton: ''Hi baby. Um, sorry, I've just got back in off my night navigation exercise.'' ''I had a busy day today again,'' the prince was heard to say. ''I've been running around the woods of Aldershot chasing shadows and getting horribly lost, and I walked into some other regiment's ambush, which was slightly embarrassing because I nearly got shot.'' ''Not by live rounds, but by blank rounds, which would have been very embarrassing, though.'' The court was also told that a male caller put on a high voice in a message left for Prince Harry, pretending to be Chelsy Davy, the younger prince's girlfriend at the time, and complimenting him on his good looks and ginger hair. The revelations in court might stir uncomfortable memories for William and others in the royal family including his father, Prince Charles, the heir to the throne. In 1993 -- before the divorce in 1996 of William's father and his mother, Princess Diana -- the so-called ''Camillagate'' tapes recorded sexually explicit remarks by Charles in a late-night conversation with Camilla Parker-Bowles, who is now Charles's second wife and is known as the Duchess of Cornwall. The conversation included Prince Charles expressing a wish to be a tampon. A year earlier, Diana was recorded talking to a man, subsequently identified by newspapers as a longtime friend, James Gilbey, who said he loved her and called her ''Squidgy.'' That became known as the ''Squidgygate'' affair. The recordings were apparently made by people using radio scanners. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
New Airport Screening Would Plumb Personal Data,"Aviation security leaders are moving forward with plans to shift toward a risk-based system of passenger screening -- an idea supported by the travel industry and government officials who want screeners to focus on travelers who may present a security threat. But as details emerge on how governments and airlines plan to distinguish between ''trusted travelers'' eligible for lighter screening and those who will receive more scrutiny, civil liberties groups and some European regulators are questioning the use of vast amounts of personal data to decide which travelers to examine more closely -- or to prevent from flying at all. Collecting and sharing information on passengers is at the heart of the new effort. The information governments use to vet passengers includes data individuals have volunteered by applying for trusted traveler programs, as well as information gathered through terrorist watch lists, criminal background checks and border checkpoint encounters. The risk-based approach also extends to the list of items prohibited from the cabin, which the Transportation Security Administration recently revised to allow small pocketknives.  As the focus turns more to identifying suspect travelers, not just suspect items, the government is also looking at data that airlines and travel agents have collected on their customers, ranging from birth dates and passport numbers to potentially confidential details apparent in travel itineraries (like a flight to Pakistan) and group discount codes (for a trip to a conference, for instance). For passengers on international flights, much of the data in these ''passenger name records'' is already shared with the Department of Homeland Security, although the agency has agreed to filter out certain records, like a traveler's kosher or halal meal preference -- a potential indicator of religion -- barring ''exceptional circumstances.'' But the prospect of using passenger data not just for border control, but also to make airport screening decisions, exposed a fissure between more privacy-oriented European officials and their American counterparts. Peter Schaar, the federal commissioner for data protection and freedom of information in Germany, speaking on a panel at an aviation security conference in Brooklyn last week, said that any system that uses passenger data to assess the security risk posed by an individual should have to meet three criteria: it must be proved to be effective at rooting out terrorists; it must be proportional to that goal, without violating privacy rights; and it must avoid negative side effects, like discrimination. ''I question whether these proposals meet at least one of those,'' he said. That perspective was in the minority at the event organized by the International Air Transport Association and attended by screening equipment manufacturers, airline and airport security directors and government officials mostly eager to move ahead -- despite budget constraints -- with what they called the passenger differentiation concept. Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, who spoke at the conference, described the agency's shift as a ''risk-based approach that attempts to segregate out passengers for whom we have a lot of information and can evaluate their risk as low-risk versus those that we know little about or that are higher risk.'' The T.S.A. also plans to focus more on devices that could do catastrophic damage to an aircraft. John S. Pistole, the agency's administrator, announced that small pocketknives and some sports equipment would be allowed in carry-on bags beginning April 25 -- an effort to more closely align American rules with European standards. The American government would also like to expand its use of behavior detection officers who question passengers in security lines, a technique used in Israel, but the Government Accountability Office has faulted the way the program is being carried out in the United States, saying it has not met scientific standards of validation. While airlines and equipment manufacturers are seeking similar security procedures worldwide, sharing travelers' data across borders -- which already happens to some degree -- presents more complex challenges. Governments are debating when and how to recognize another country's trusted travelers, and how to respond if nations like China start asking for the same level of passenger data that the United States demands. The debate is likely to become more heated as civil rights groups and passengers -- two groups unrepresented at the conference -- get a clearer sense of where trusted traveler programs are headed. ''The notion that the government is in any position to judge who is trusted and who is risky is very problematic,'' said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. ''Terrorist attacks on airlines are basically freak events -- fortunately, they're exceedingly rare -- so any attempt to predict who is likely to engage in that type of thing is inevitably going to sweep up a vast number of innocent people.'' That has been the case with the government's Global Entry program, a trusted-traveler initiative that allows members who have undergone background checks to use a kiosk to clear customs instead of waiting to speak with an agent. Members also gain access to PreCheck lanes for expedited security screening at some airports. The T.S.A. has been encouraging passengers to apply for Global Entry as a way to expand PreCheck eligibility, but some travelers are discovering that applying for the program can result in an ''untrusted'' label. For instance, a woman, who for privacy reasons did not want her name used, said she had been detained for questioning by the police as a teenager but was never charged with a crime. Because of this incident, she said, she was rejected by Global Entry. Since there was no court case, she cannot get the record of disposition required by the Global Entry enrollment center, which did not accept the official letter from the court she submitted. Although she said she had sent an appeal to the trusted-traveler ombudsman last fall, she is still waiting for a response. ''What is this category that I'm in now that I can't fix?'' she asked. Other travelers have reported similar frustrations with the program's lack of transparency. Some people say they have no idea why they were rejected, while others have been denied based on minor incidents with law enforcement years ago. One in four American adults has some type of criminal record (meaning an arrest or a conviction), according to the Justice Department and the National Employment Law Project. That could exclude millions of people from the trusted traveler pool and complicate the government's goal to include half of all airline passengers in the trusted category. Travelers who have been placed on the T.S.A.'s PreCheck Disqualification List may also be excluded. In a notice published in the Federal Register in November, the agency described this roster as ''a watch list of individuals who are disqualified from eligibility from T.S.A. PreCheck, for some period of time or permanently, because they have been involved in violations of security regulations of sufficient severity or frequency.'' The notice indicated that this list would be generated by the T.S.A.'s Performance and Results Information System, which ''maintains records related to the investigation or prosecution of violations of federal, state, local or international criminal law.'' Those violations range from getting caught with a loaded firearm at a checkpoint to disobeying aviation security regulations at the airport or on board aircraft. David Castelveter, a T.S.A. spokesman, said the list might include altercations between passengers and flight crew that end up involving federal air marshals or other agency representatives. ''We don't talk about how you do or do not get on certain lists, for security reasons,'' he said. One man, Sal Bevivino, said he had been involved in that type of incident last April, when he asked a Virgin America flight attendant for a soda and was told he had to request one using the aircraft's seat-back system -- an interaction that somehow escalated into a report to the captain. After the plane landed at the San Francisco airport, Mr. Bevivino was detained for questioning by several police officers, who also called the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and a T.S.A. employee. Although the police report on the incident noted that the flight's captain said that ''at no time did he or his flight crew feel threatened regarding this passenger,'' the report is now part of Mr. Bevivino's record. ''My biggest concern is that somebody on an aircraft has the power to outright lie about an incident and get me in all kinds of trouble,'' he said. ''Civil rights have gone out the window.'' "
"Stern Words, and a Pea-Size Punishment, for Google","SAN FRANCISCO -- Regulators in Germany, one of the most privacy-sensitive countries in the world, unleashed their wrath on Google on Monday for scooping up sensitive personal information in the Street View mapping project, and imposed the largest fine ever assessed by European regulators over a privacy violation. The penalty? $189,225. Put another way, that's how much Google made every two minutes last year, or roughly 0.002 percent of its $10.7 billion in net profit.  It is the latest example of regulators' meager arsenal of fines and punishments for corporations in the wrong. Academics, activists and even regulators themselves say fines that are pocket change for companies do little to deter them from misbehaving again, and are merely baked into the cost of doing business. Johannes Caspar, the data protection supervisor in Hamburg, Germany, who led the investigation into the Street View project, said the fine, which was close to the maximum of 150,000 euros, or $195,000, that he could legally impose, was woefully inadequate to stop the data collection practices of companies as large as Google. He called on lawmakers to significantly raise such fines. ''As long as violations of data protection law are penalized with such insignificant sums, the ability of existing laws to protect personal privacy in the digital world, with its high potential for abuse, is barely possible,'' Mr. Caspar said. In Europe, lawmakers are considering revisions to the main data protection law to allow for fines of up to 2 percent of a company's annual sales. In Google's case, based on last year's revenue, that would have been up to $1 billion. For several years, while Google took photos for its Street View maps, it also collected data like e-mail messages and photos over unencrypted Wi-Fi networks, outraging consumers and privacy advocates and prompting investigations in at least a dozen countries. Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, said the company collected the data inadvertently, did not use it and cooperated with investigators in Hamburg. For Silicon Valley companies, such middling fines are common. For the Street View violation, Google last year paid a $25,000 fine for obstructing the federal investigation, and last month agreed to pay $7 million to settle a lawsuit brought by 38 states. France fined Google 100,000 euros in 2011; Ireland and Britain did not impose fines after Google agreed to delete data collected illegally in their countries. For another privacy violation, related to the Safari browser, the Federal Trade Commission last year settled with Google for $22.5 million, the largest civil penalty it had ever levied, though Google did not admit any wrongdoing. The commission similarly filed eight complaints against Facebook for ''unfair and deceptive'' practices related to privacy, with no fine or admission of guilt. In antitrust investigations, Google escaped a fine in the United States and is close to doing the same in Europe. ''Especially in these areas like privacy or online access to information, existing law hasn't really dealt with these issues before because as technology changes, the law needs to play catch-up,'' said Martin H. Pritikin, a professor at Whittier Law School who co-writes the blog the Collection Gap, about regulatory enforcement failure. Still, the problem stretches far beyond the tech industry. After the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, lawmakers and even some judges questioned whether government fines amounted to a rounding error for the nation's biggest banks. Jed S. Rakoff, a federal judge in New York, called the Securities and Exchange Commission's $150 million settlement with Bank of America over lax public disclosures ''half-baked justice at best,'' and its $285 million settlement with Citigroup ''pocket change.'' Even when Goldman Sachs paid a record $550 million fine to the agency in 2010, it amounted to less than 10 percent of the bank's profit that year. On Wall Street, the public hand-wringing also stemmed from a lack of criminal charges. When the authorities leveled a record $1.9 billion penalty against HSBC in a money-laundering case, they stopped short of indicting the British bank, saying that such a move could jeopardize the financial system. The decision raised concerns that Wall Street was not only too big to fail, but also too big to indict. That reflects a broader attitude against fining companies too severely, Mr. Pritikin said. If a fine is too big, the argument goes, it hurts shareholders if the stock price suffers, and consumers if the company has to raise prices to pay the fine. But when John H. Nugent, a management professor at Texas Woman's University, studied the topic, he said he was surprised to find that the opposite was true, and that even large fines had little long-term effect on companies' stock prices. ''Management will often choose to take actions they may know are improper because they realize the long-term consequences will not affect them,'' Mr. Nugent said. Still, even a trivial fine has some consequences, said James M. Anderson, who studies the role of law in regulating business at RAND Corporation. ''There may be some good that is accomplished even if the amount in question is all but nominal, in expressing some notion that as a society, we have collectively said this is a problem,'' he said. And the public relations fallout of any regulatory penalty can be significant for companies like Google, which is extremely sensitive about its reputation in the eyes of consumers, said Chris Hoofnagle, a lecturer on privacy law at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. But Ezra Ross, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law and a co-writer of the Collection Gap blog, said the German fine had the opposite effect. ''They can say, 'Look at the amount of the fine. Even the government obviously didn't think this was a very big deal,' '' he said. He suggested that regulators find creative ways to punish companies, like preventing Google from using and profiting from the legitimate Street View data it collected while it was inappropriately collecting personal data. Another solution, Mr. Pritikin said, is to punish individuals with fines or jail time, though that is also complicated because companies have insurance to cover such fines and it is often difficult to single out one person responsible for a decision. Enforcement is at a turning point, Mr. Hoofnagle said, and fines could blossom, especially if a tech company's privacy violation caused serious harm. ''We're still working out as a society what the harms are for privacy violations, and we're not likely to see hundreds of millions of dollars in fines unless blood is spilled,'' he said. ''But you can see how that could happen.'' "
A Blow Against Big Brother,"NEW YORK -- On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly is expected to approve a resolution recognizing an international ''right to privacy in the digital age'' -- a significant political development in response to the controversy over the surveillance tactics of the United States National Security Agency. As an attempt to get governments to rein in abusive behavior, the resolution is widely viewed as a victory for that part of the political universe where liberal progressives and conservative libertarians meet. Buried in the text of the resolution, however, is a very different policy agenda, one that may surprise libertarians and delight progressives.  The main controversy surrounding the resolution has been its language suggesting that governments must respect the privacy of noncitizens living in their countries. Compromise language on that score was introduced to the satisfaction of the United States government. What has largely escaped notice in the press and in political commentary on the resolution, however, is a different but no less profound commitment on the part of states: to regulate abuses by corporate, private actors. It is that commitment, buried in the subtleties of the United Nations text, that threatens the notion of a progressive-libertarian harmony in this area, and that promises to propel international efforts to address intrusions on individuals' privacy by the Googles of the world. A casual read of the resolution suggests that it simply does what it says -- call on member states ''to review their procedures, practices and legislation on the surveillance of communications, their interception and collection of personal data, including mass surveillance.'' In its core provision, however, the resolution calls on all member states ''to respect and protect'' this international right. The exact meaning of the words ''to respect and protect'' will likely escape those who are unfamiliar with United Nations jargon, but these terms are vitally important. By calling on states both to respect and protect the right to privacy, the resolution includes an expectation for member states to regulate private actors. Requiring governments to ''respect'' privacy rights essentially refers to negative rights -- freedom from interference by the state. Nothing earth-shattering there. Requiring governments ''protect'' privacy rights, however, refers to positive obligations upon the state -- a duty of the government to safeguard individuals from abuse by third parties. In United Nations circles, it is well understood that such a duty to safeguard includes protection from other private actors, including businesses. The resolution, of course, imposes no direct legal obligation. It is, however, an important part of international agenda-setting and helps to establish new norms and expectations for government behavior. The resolution itself also sets up some of the international machinery to make sure that happens. For example, it calls on the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to produce reports and recommendations for further action ''on the protection and promotion of the right to privacy.'' It is, indeed, due to these political stakes that the United States engaged in strenuous diplomatic efforts to shape the language of the resolution to its liking. In the wake of Edward J. Snowden's revelations, we have witnessed coalitions of interesting bedfellows, as the interests of libertarians, progressives and human rights advocates have coalesced around protecting the individual right to privacy. The adoption and long-term political effects of the United Nations resolution may showcase some of the obstacles to forging these novel political coalitions in the United States. It will also usher in a new international effort that shifts the focus on the state as not only a possible threat to online privacy -- but also a potential regulator and protector.

Privacy Groups Ask F.T.C. to Block Facebook Policy Changes,"A coalition of six major consumer privacy groups has asked the Federal Trade Commission to block coming changes to Facebook's privacy policies that they say would make it easier for the social network to use personal data about its users, including children under 18, in advertising on the site. In a letter sent to the agency late Wednesday, the coalition said Facebook's changes, scheduled to go into effect later this week, violate a 2011 order and settlement with the F.T.C. over user privacy.  ""Facebook users who reasonably believed that their images and content would not be used for commercial purposes without their consent will now find their pictures showing up on the pages of their friends endorsing the products of Facebook's advertisers,"" the letter says. ""Remarkably, their images could even be used by Facebook to endorse products that the user does not like or even use."" As I wrote in a Bits post last week, the plain language in Facebook's new policy documents seems to reverse the default setting for user privacy when it comes to advertising. The old language gives users the explicit right to control how their names, faces and other information are used for advertising and other commercial purposes. The company's new policy says consumers are automatically giving Facebook the right to use their information unless they explicitly revoke permission  - and the company made that harder to do by removing the direct link to the control used to adjust that permission. ""Facebook is now claiming the default setting is they can use everyone's name and image for advertising and commercial purposes, including those of minors, without their consent,"" said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, one of the groups that wrote the letter, in an interview. ""Red lights are going off in the privacy world."" The privacy groups, which helped persuade the F.T.C. to issue the 2011 order, said Facebook's changes regarding children were especially problematic. The company's new policy says that if a user is under age 18, ""you represent that at least one of your parents or legal guardians has also agreed to the terms of this section (and the use of your name, profile picture, content, and information) on your behalf."" ""It's an extraordinary claim to make,"" Mr. Rotenberg said. ""That's something you can't do without explicit consent."" He said courts and regulators have found that the personal information of children should receive special privacy protection. Facebook, which has nearly 1.2 billion users worldwide, said last week that the privacy policy changes were partly made to clarify what it does with user information as part of a recent class-action settlement in the United States over its privacy practices. ""As part of this proposed update, we revised our explanation of how things like your name, profile picture and content may be used in connection with ads or commercial content to make it clear that you are granting Facebook permission for this use when you use our services,"" a company spokeswoman, Debbie Frost, said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We have not changed our ads practices or policies - we only made things clearer for people who use our service."" Comments by Facebook users have been overwhelmingly negative on the official page where the company's chief privacy officer for policy, Erin Egan, announced the changes. The groups asking the F.T.C. to block Facebook's privacy changes are the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the Center for Digital Democracy, Consumer Watchdog, Patient Privacy Rights, U.S. PIRG, and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. An F.T.C. spokeswoman could not confirm receipt of the letter on Wednesday evening and had no additional comment. Typically, the agency does review such letters. And in the case of the 2011 Facebook settlement, the agency periodically examines the company's compliance with the commission's order.  "
Government Announces Steps to Restore Confidence on Encryption Standards,"SAN FRANCISCO - The federal agency charged with recommending cybersecurity standards said Tuesday that it would reopen the public vetting process for an encryption standard, after reports that the National Security Agency had written the standard and could break it. ""We want to assure the I.T. cybersecurity community that the transparent, public process used to rigorously vet our standards is still in place,"" The National Institute of Standards and Technology said in a public statement. ""N.I.S.T. would not deliberately weaken a cryptographic standard.""  The announcement followed reports published by The New York Times, The Guardian and ProPublica last Thursday about the N.S.A.'s success in foiling much of the encryption that protects vast amounts of information on the Web. The Times reported that as part of its efforts, the N.S.A. had inserted a back door into a 2006 standard adopted by N.I.S.T. and later by the International Organization for Standardization, which counts 163 countries as members. For encryption to be secure, the system must generate secret prime numbers randomly. That random number generation process - which is based on mathematical algorithms - makes it practically impossible for an attacker, or intelligence agency, to predict the scrambling protocols that would allow it to unscramble an encrypted message. But internal memos leaked by a former N.S.A. contractor, Edward Snowden, suggest that the N.S.A. generated one of the random number generators used in a 2006 N.I.S.T. standard - called the Dual EC DRBG standard - which contains a back door for the N.S.A. In publishing the standard, N.I.S.T. acknowledged ""contributions"" from N.S.A., but not primary authorship. Internal N.S.A. memos describe how the agency subsequently worked behind the scenes to push the same standard on the International Organization for Standardization. ""The road to developing this standard was smooth once the journey began,"" one memo noted. ""However, beginning the journey was a challenge in finesse."" At the time, Canada's Communications Security Establishment ran the standards process for the international organization, but classified documents describe how ultimately the N.S.A. seized control. ""After some behind-the-scenes finessing with the head of the Canadian national delegation and with C.S.E., the stage was set for N.S.A. to submit a rewrite of the draft,"" the memo notes. ""Eventually, N.S.A. became the sole editor."" Cryptographers have long had mixed feelings about N.I.S.T.'s close relationship with the N.S.A., but many said last week's revelations had confirmed their worst fears and eroded their confidence in N.I.S.T. standards entirely. ""We'll have to re-evaluate that relationship,"" Matthew D. Green, a cryptography researcher at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in a blog post Thursday. ""Trust has been violated."" (Mr. Green said on Twitter Monday that Johns Hopkins asked him to remove that blog post.  He was allowed to reinstate it hours later after the university realized the content was based on public news reports. The university later apologized.) On Tuesday, N.I.S.T. attributed the allegations to confusion and noted that it was required, by statute, to consult with the N.S.A. ""There has been some confusion about the standards development process and the role of different organizations in it,"" the agency's statement read. ""N.I.S.T. has a long history of extensive collaboration with the world's cryptography experts to support robust encryption. The National Security Agency (N.S.A.) participates in the N.I.S.T. cryptography process because of its recognized expertise. N.I.S.T. is also required by statute to consult with the N.S.A."" The agency said that because of cryptographers' concerns, it would reopen the public comment period for three publications - Special Publication 800-90A and drafts of Special Publications 800-90B and 800-90C - which all use the random number generator in question. ""If vulnerabilities are found in these or any other N.I.S.T. standard, we will work with the cryptographic community to address them as quickly as possible,"" the agency's statement said. ""I know from firsthand communications that a number of people at N.I.S.T. feel betrayed by their colleagues at the N.S.A.,"" Mr. Green said in an interview Tuesday. ""Reopening the standard is the first step in fixing that betrayal and restoring confidence in N.I.S.T.""  "
Never Mind Facebook; Winklevoss Twins Rule in Digital Money,"The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler -- Olympic rowers, nemeses of Mark Zuckerberg -- are laying claim to a new title: bitcoin moguls. The Winklevii, as they are known, have amassed since last summer what appears to be one of the single largest portfolios of the digital money, whose wild gyrations have Silicon Valley and Wall Street talking. The twins, the first prominent figures in the largely anonymous bitcoin world to publicly disclose a big stake, say they own nearly $11 million worth. Or at least $11 million as of Thursday morning -- when trading was temporarily suspended after the latest and largest flash crash left a single bitcoin worth about $120 and the whole market worth $1.3 billion. At one point, the price had plummeted 60 percent.  To skeptics, the frenzy over the bitcoin network created by anonymous programmers in 2009 looks more like the mania for Dutch tulip bulbs in the 1600s than the beginnings of an actual currency. ''To say highly speculative would be the understatement of the century,'' said Steve Hanke, a professor specializing in alternative currencies at Johns Hopkins University. Whatever else it is, bitcoin has become the financial phenomenon of the moment. In addition to the identical twins, Silicon Valley investment firms, while not holding bitcoins, are starting to show interest in the technology. On Thursday, a group of venture capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz, announced that they were financing a bitcoin-related company, OpenCoin. The Winklevosses say this week's tumult is just growing pains for a digital currency that they believe will become a sort of gold for the technorati. ''People say it's a Ponzi scheme, it's a bubble,'' said Cameron Winklevoss. ''People really don't want to take it seriously. At some point that narrative will shift to 'virtual currencies are here to stay.' We're in the early days.'' While little is known about the creator of bitcoin, or if it even was a single person, the work involved serious programming chops, building a system that could live on borrowed computer space around the world. It was determined that only a finite number of bitcoins could be created -- the count is currently around 11 million. New coins are ''mined'' by programmers who solve mathematic riddles and can sell their coins on upstart exchanges. For now, there are few places where bitcoins can be used. One marketplace is an online bazaar, Silk Road, where narcotics are reportedly the main wares for sale. But bitcoin believers imagine a future where the e-cash can be used at their local Starbucks. The Winklevosses have paid in bitcoin for the services of a Ukrainian computer programmer who has worked on their Web site. ''We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error,'' Tyler Winklevoss said. This is not the brothers' first gamble on an unproved technology. As students at Harvard, the twins founded a social networking site, ConnectU, and enlisted their schoolmate, Mark Zuckerberg, to help them build the company. After Mr. Zuckerberg went off to start Facebook, the brothers sued him, accusing him of stealing their idea -- a story that was dramatized in the movie ''The Social Network.'' The case was settled with the brothers being given $20 million in cash and Facebook shares that are now worth more than $200 million. They have parlayed that fortune into Winklevoss Capital. Their first two investments were in Hukkster, a start-up shopping Web site and SumZero, an online community for professional money managers. The brothers began dabbling in bitcoin last summer when the dollar value of a single coin was still in the single digits. To keep their holdings secure from hackers, they have taken the complex codes that represent their holdings off networked computers and saved them on small flash drives, putting the drives, in turn, in safe deposit boxes at banks in three different cities. It's hard to verify how the Winklevoss holdings compare with other bitcoin players, given the anonymity of accounts, and the twins say they believe that some early users of the system probably have holdings that are at least as large. A Maltese company, Exante, started a hedge fund that the company says has bought up about 82,000 bitcoins -- or about $10 million as of Thursday -- with money from wealthy investors. A founder of the fund, Anatoli Knyazev, said his main concern was hackers and government regulators, who have so far mostly left the currency alone. These investments were all in an uncertain state on Thursday after the big price swings and the shutdown of trading on Mt. Gox, a Japanese-based company that claims to handle 80 percent of all bitcoin trades. Mt. Gox said in a statement that the problems were a result of the currency's popularity, making it impossible to process all the incoming orders. It added that it was not the victim of hackers but ''instead victim of our own success!'' The 6-foot-5 Winklevoss brothers were unfazed. The brothers said they took advantage of the low prices to buy more. ''It has been four years and it has yet to be discredited as a viable alternative to fiat currency,'' Tyler Winklevoss said. ''We could be totally wrong, but we are curious to see this play out a lot more.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
The Antisocial Network,"Bitcoin's wild ride may not have been the biggest business story of the past few weeks, but it was surely the most entertaining. Over the course of less than two weeks the price of the ''digital currency'' more than tripled. Then it fell more than 50 percent in a few hours. Suddenly, it felt as if we were back in the dot-com era. The economic significance of this roller coaster was basically nil. But the furor over bitcoin was a useful lesson in the ways people misunderstand money -- and in particular how they are misled by the desire to divorce the value of money from the society it serves.  What is bitcoin? It's sometimes described as a way to make transactions online -- but that in itself would be nothing new in a world of online credit-card and PayPal transactions. In fact, the Commerce Department estimates that by 2010 about 16 percent of total sales in America already took the form of e-commerce. So how is bitcoin different? Unlike credit card transactions, which leave a digital trail, bitcoin transactions are designed to be anonymous and untraceable. When you transfer bitcoins to someone else, it's as if you handed over a paper bag filled with $100 bills in a dark alley. And sure enough, as best as anyone can tell the main use of bitcoin so far, other than as a target for speculation, has been for online versions of those dark-alley exchanges, with bitcoins traded for narcotics and other illegal items. But bitcoin evangelists insist that it's about much more than greasing the path for illicit transactions. The biggest declared investors in bitcoins are the Winklevoss brothers, wealthy twins who successfully sued for a share of Facebook and were made famous by the movie ''The Social Network'' -- and they make claims for the digital product similar to those made by goldbugs for their favorite metal. ''We have elected,'' declared Tyler Winklevoss recently, ''to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error.'' The similarity to goldbug rhetoric isn't a coincidence, since goldbugs and bitcoin enthusiasts -- bitbugs? -- tend to share both libertarian politics and the belief that governments are vastly abusing their power to print money. At the same time, it's very peculiar, since bitcoins are in a sense the ultimate fiat currency, with a value conjured out of thin air. Gold's value comes in part because it has nonmonetary uses, such as filling teeth and making jewelry; paper currencies have value because they're backed by the power of the state, which defines them as legal tender and accepts them as payment for taxes. Bitcoins, however, derive their value, if any, purely from self-fulfilling prophecy, the belief that other people will accept them as payment. However, let's leave that strangeness on one side, along with the peculiar ''mining'' process -- actually a process of complex calculation -- used to add to the bitcoin stock. Instead, let's focus on the two huge misconceptions -- one practical, one philosophical -- that underlie both goldbugism and bitbugism. The practical misconception here -- and it's a big one -- is the notion that we live in an era of wildly irresponsible money printing, with runaway inflation just around the corner. It's true that the Federal Reserve and other central banks have greatly expanded their balance sheets -- but they've done that explicitly as a temporary measure in response to economic crisis. I know, government officials are not to be trusted and all that, but the truth is that Ben Bernanke's promises that his actions wouldn't be inflationary have been vindicated year after year, while goldbugs' dire warnings of inflation keep not coming true. The philosophical misconception, however, seems to me to be even bigger. Goldbugs and bitbugs alike seem to long for a pristine monetary standard, untouched by human frailty. But that's an impossible dream. Money is, as Paul Samuelson once declared, a ''social contrivance,'' not something that stands outside society. Even when people relied on gold and silver coins, what made those coins useful wasn't the precious metals they contained, it was the expectation that other people would accept them as payment. Actually, you'd expect the Winklevosses, of all people, to get this, because in a way money is like a social network, which is useful only to the extent that other people use it. But I guess some people are just bothered by the notion that money is a human thing, and want the benefits of the monetary network without the social part. Sorry, it can't be done. So do we need a new form of money? I guess you could make that case if the money we actually have were misbehaving. But it isn't. We have huge economic problems, but green pieces of paper are doing fine -- and we should let them alone. "
Winklevoss Twins Plan First Fund For Bitcoins,"Bitcoin has been promoted as an alternative crypto-currency that exists outside the realms of governments and central banks. Now, two backers of the digital money are seeking to bring bitcoin into the investing mainstream -- if they win the approval of the United States government. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins best known for their part in the history of Facebook, filed a proposal with securities regulators on Monday that would allow any investor to trade bitcoins, just as if they were stocks. The plan involves an exchange-traded fund, which usually tracks a basket of stocks or a commodity, but in this case would hold only bitcoins. It is part of a broader effort to remove the stigma hovering over bitcoin and other online money endeavors, which have faced a barrage of regulatory questions and enforcement actions. Recently the world's largest trading exchange for bitcoins, Mt.Gox, filed with the Treasury Department to register itself as a money services business and comply with money-laundering laws. The proposal from the twins, who already have sizable bitcoin holdings, is an audacious one: the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust could send digital money from the realm of computer programmers, Internet entrepreneurs and a small circle of professional investors like themselves into the hands of retail investors -- virtually anyone with a brokerage account.  ''The trust brings bitcoin to Main Street and mainstream investors to bitcoin,'' said Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Math-Based Asset Services, which would operate the proposed fund. ''It eliminates the friction of buying and reduces the risks associated with storing bitcoin while offering similar investment attributes to direct ownership.'' Their proposal has the advantage of coming from the desk of Kathleen Moriarty, a lawyer at Katten Muchin, who played a leading role in the creation of the first exchange-traded fund and popular gold- and silver-backed E.T.F.'s. But it is far from certain that securities regulators will approve. Even if they do, such a fund would face major challenges, including the current bottlenecks that stop bitcoins from being easily bought and sold. ''There are so many ways it could go wrong,'' said Ugo Egbunike, a senior specialist in exchange-traded funds at the data company Index Universe. On Monday, several market participants suggested that the proposal was a long shot that was merely an attempt to legitimize the digital currency. But Cameron Winklevoss expressed confidence that regulators would bless the new investment. ''We have assembled a team that has successfully launched novel products before, and we firmly believe in the chances of success for this product,'' he said. The filing is the latest eye-catching development in bitcoin's history since it was founded by an anonymous hacker, or hackers, in 2009. Unlike traditional money, bitcoins exist in no physical form and are not backed by a central bank. Instead, the coins are created by a network of users who solve complex mathematical problems -- a method known as ''mining'' -- to generate bitcoins. Only a finite number of bitcoins can be created -- 21 million -- with the current count at about 11 million. A limited number of stores and Web sites are accepting bitcoin as payment, but for now it is primarily a vehicle for speculators. ''The value of bitcoins is determined by the value that various market participants place on bitcoins through their transactions,'' the brothers' filing says. The currency grabbed the attention of global markets in April when the value of a single bitcoin spiked to more than $250 from $110, before plummeting. While there were questions about the survival of the currency, the value of a bitcoin has recently hovered around $100, making the total market worth about $1 billion. During the April swoon, the Winklevosses went public with their own bitcoin hoard, amounting to about 1 percent of all outstanding coins, or about $10 million. Bitcoins can currently only be bought and sold on informal computer networks and on online marketplaces that require substantial technological savvy and are far more complicated than traditional exchanges. The inaccessibility, and the limited quantity of bitcoins, appeal to users who are skeptical of governments and central banks. But it has made the system vulnerable at times to hackers and technology flaws. An exchange-traded fund would make it significantly easier to gain exposure to bitcoins, just as commodities-based funds have made investing in gold, silver and other precious metals more accessible. The Winklevoss fund would buy one bitcoin for every five shares, making the value of a single share worth about a fifth of a single bitcoin. Regulated trading desks would have to handle the daily buying and selling of the shares. The company operated by the Winklevosses would have a proprietary method for storing the fund's bitcoin holdings and would charge an annual management fee, which is not specified in the filing. Monday's submission comes at a precarious time for digital money. In May, the operators of another online currency, Liberty Reserve, were indicted on charges that they facilitated billions of dollars of money laundering. Both before and after that, state and federal regulators were scrutinizing many players in the growing bitcoin economy, including the largest place to buy and sell the coins, the Tokyo-based Mt.Gox. Before Mt.Gox registered with the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, some of its accounts in the United States were frozen. The company temporarily stopped its American customers from cashing out while it said it was ''making improvements.'' Mt.Gox's difficulties highlight the risks that could confront the owner of shares in a bitcoin fund. The securities filing made Monday has 18 pages of ''risk factors,'' noting, among other concerns, the heavy presence of speculators and ''an uncertain regulatory landscape.'' Mr. Egbunike said regulators may hesitate to approve the proposal because of the questions surrounding bitcoins and recent scrutiny of exchange-traded funds more broadly. While such funds have made the buying and selling of commodities and other complicated financial assets easier for retail investors, they have given these investors access to products that they may not understand. For current bitcoin aficionados, an E.T.F. could diminish the currency's free-spirited appeal. But even if the Winklevosses' proposal fails, some industry experts said that it marks a significant signpost in the push to give virtual currencies at least a veneer of respectability. ''Digital currencies are not going away,'' said Carol Van Cleef, the head of law firm Patton Boggs's emerging-payments practice. ''And as bitcoin rises in popularity, you're going to see traditional financial products and services being adapted to it.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Virtual Currency Gains Ground in Actual World,"Depending on whom you ask, bitcoins are a goofy geek invention with as much long-term value as Monopoly money -- or a technology development that could transform currency the way e-mail and texting have transformed correspondence. A type of digital cash, bitcoins were invented in 2009 and can be sent directly to anyone, anywhere in the world. You don't have to go through a financial institution, which means no fees and no one tracking your spending habits. With a current market capitalization of $1 billion, bitcoins are beginning to be more widely accepted. You can use them to pay for a pizza or make speculative bets that could end up financing your child's college education. But bitcoins, and other digital currencies, have also come under scrutiny. Liberty Reserve, an online payment system, was shuttered in the spring by New York authorities, who said the company used its digital currency, known as LRs, to launder up to $6 billion. And law enforcement officials have voiced concerns that bitcoins could also abet illegal transactions. Bart Chilton, a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, suggested that bitcoins might be ripe for regulation. Moreover, some critics say the bitcoin infrastructure is insecure, as hackable as any other computer-based system.  ''The way the basic bitcoin system works is both incredibly solid and incredibly clever from a technical standpoint,'' said Nicholas Weaver, senior staff researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, which studies and advances a range of emerging technologies. ''The system's security is fragile, however, and the economic model behind bitcoin is, well, crazy stupid.'' Nonetheless, paying with bitcoins can be a weirdly fun way to make transactions. Here is a primer on how to do it. Like gold, bitcoins, which are both a currency and a commodity, are in limited supply (there is a cap of 21 million total) and have to be ''mined'' before they are put in circulation. Anyone can mine for bitcoins by downloading software, known as the bitcoin client, which algorithmically crunches a bunch of numbers to legitimize or authenticate a sequence or ''block'' of past bitcoin transactions. So bitcoins are basically minted as a reward for contributing to the smooth operation of the system. Validating a block yields 25 bitcoins, which are currently worth $2,675. The fluctuating price of bitcoins, also like gold, is a function of supply and demand, as well as psychology. ''Bitcoins have value because people say they have value,'' said Andrew White, a former I.T. manager for the Wikipedia Foundation and now a digital currency entrepreneur in San Francisco. Unlike fiat currencies like the United States dollar and virtual currencies like Facebook credits and the one invented by Liberty Reserve, bitcoins are not created or controlled by a central authority. But with the blistering rate of bitcoin transactions these days, you need a pricey and complex computer rig to effectively run the bitcoin client and procure some bitcoin bounty. An easier way to get bitcoins is to just find someone willing to sell them to you. Julian Tosh, an I.T. systems administrator in Las Vegas, for example, lets friends and family buy items on his Amazon wish list and pays them back in bitcoins. ''This works well as long as I need stuff,'' said Mr. Tosh, who also presides over a Wednesday ''Bitcoin Lunch Mob'' in Las Vegas, which gathers to discuss and trade bitcoins. But maybe you don't personally know any bitcoin enthusiasts like Mr. Tosh or the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, who own around $11 million worth and have filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission to form a bitcoin investment trust. If so, you might try localbitcoins.com, which lists people in your area who are willing to exchange bitcoins for cold hard cash. The market price Tuesday afternoon was $107 for a bitcoin. Be sure to check out sellers' profiles and reviews to make sure they are reputable. And, of course, it's always a good idea to meet in a public place to make the transaction. Bitcoins can be easily transferred and stored using a digital wallet app on your Android mobile device. Popular wallet apps include BitcoinSpinner and Bitcoin Wallet. There are no iOS bitcoin wallet apps and Apple did not respond to e-mails seeking an explanation. But Blockchain has an online wallet service that you can access using any Internet-connected desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone. You can also get bitcoins through Mt.Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange and where the currency is traded as a commodity. But it's a cumbersome and lengthy process, requiring wire transfers and scanning identity documents. The company, which is based in Japan, also charges a 0.6 percent fee for all transactions. Keep in mind that the United States Department of Homeland Security in May seized Mt.Gox's United States accounts, saying it misrepresented the full extent of its financial operations. The company did not respond to requests for comment but continues to function as before the seizure. Another option is Coinbase, a bitcoin transaction platform, which recently announced a $5 million infusion of venture capital. While it's still a nascent venture (not even a year old), the service hasn't had any major hiccups yet and is relatively simple to use. You just enter your bank account and routing number, how many bitcoins you want and click ''buy.'' You can also send bitcoins to others through your Coinbase account. Just know you'll be charged a 1 percent transaction fee. Once you have your bitcoins, the fun part is spending them. Bitcoin. travel, BitcoinsInVegas.com, Spendbitcoins.com and Reddit have directories of businesses that accept bitcoins as payment. And Bitpremier.com lists high-priced luxury items (cars, jets, yachts, etc.) you can buy with bitcoins. To make a purchase, all you have to do is type the receiver's key code or scan their QR code into your bitcoin wallet and you're done. Like cash transactions, you can't cancel payment later, so be sure it's what you want before you click ''send.'' Brewster Kahle, a founder of the Internet Archive in San Francisco, said he routinely used bitcoins to pay for lunch at a local sushi restaurant. He's interested in the technology and appreciates the libertarian aspect of it. ''Bitcoin used to be just in the land of computer geeks, but not anymore,'' he said. More businesses are accepting bitcoins lately thanks to Bitpay, which supplies software for processing bitcoin payments. The merchant pays a 0.99 percent fee per transaction versus the 2 to 4 percent fees charged by credit card companies. Bitpay will also immediately convert bitcoins to dollars if the merchant desires. ''Bitcoin users are pretty enthusiastic, so you get instant loyal customers,'' said Adam Penn, owner of Veggie Galaxy, a restaurant in Cambridge, Mass., which began accepting bitcoins through Bitpay in May. ''So far, it's been a no-risk revenue generator.'' Also last month, Bitpay announced a partnership with the mobile gift card app Gyft, which will allow people to use bitcoins to purchase gift cards from hundreds of retailers including Brookstone, Lowe's, Gap, Sephora, GameStop, American Eagle, Nike, Marriott, Burger King and Fandango. ''It's a huge development,'' said Mr. Tosh in Las Vegas, who predicts Gyft's embrace of bitcoins will lead to widespread use of the alternative currency. ''Pandora's box has been smashed.'' Or maybe not. The legal trouble at Mt.Gox sent a shiver through the market as did S.E.C. charges last week that the founder and operator of the lesser-known Bitcoin Savings and Trust in McKinney, Tex., was running a bitcoin Ponzi scheme. Still, bitcoin advocates point out that, despite some bad actors, the actual system has not had a major security breach. Nevertheless, even the most ardent bitcoin boosters urge caution. Bitcoins have appreciated more than 700 percent since this time last year -- an increase some have compared to a bubble bound to burst. ''It's supervolatile, so I'd tell people to go slow,'' said Peter Vessenes, chairman and executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes the currency. ''Never hold more bitcoins than you're prepared to lose.'' "
New York and U.S. Open Investigations Into Bitcoins,"Updated, 8:55 p.m. | State and federal officials are starting broad investigations into shortcomings in the oversight of upstart virtual currencies like bitcoin. The Senate's committee on homeland security sent a letter this week to the major financial regulators and law enforcement agencies asking about the ''threats and risks related to virtual currency.'' These currencies, whose popularity has grown in recent years, are often used in online transactions that are not monitored by traditional financial institutions. ''This is something that is clearly not going away, and it demands a whole government response,'' said a person involved in the Senate committee's investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry is continuing.  The Senate letter went out the same day that New York's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, sent subpoenas to 22 companies that have had some involvement with bitcoin, according to a person briefed on the investigation. Previously, there have been isolated efforts to crack down on those who took advantage of virtual currencies. But the two investigations made public this week appear to be the most wide-ranging government efforts to exert more coordinated control over what has been a largely faceless and borderless phenomenon. Bitcoin, the most well-known digital currency, was started by anonymous Japanese computer programmers in 2009 and was intended to serve as an alternative to national currencies. Only a limited number of bitcoins can be created. And an online community has bid up the price of individual bitcoins, which are stored digitally on a decentralized network of computers. On Tuesday, a bitcoin was being sold for about $108 online. Lawmakers are worried that bitcoin and other alternative forms of money can be used to evade taxes, defraud investors and assist trade in illegal products like drugs and pornography. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused a Texas man of profiting from a bitcoin Ponzi scheme on the same day it issued a broader warning about the dangers of similar frauds. Earlier this year, the operators of another virtual currency, Liberty Reserve, were accused of running a $6 billion money-laundering ring. The Senate committee began looking into virtual currency a few months ago, formally interviewing several regulators and industry participants. The committee recently stepped up its efforts because staff members had heard ''real concern'' from law enforcement officials, and because it became clear that regulators did not have enough information about the technology, according to the person involved in the investigation. ''The federal government must make sure that potential threats and risks are dealt with swiftly,'' the Senate letter said. Both the Senate committee and Mr. Lawsky have emphasized that the technology could have good uses, and any new regulations would help protect those. But Mr. Lawsky, in a formal notice released on Monday, said, ''If virtual currencies remain a virtual Wild West for narcotraffickers and other criminals, that would not only threaten our country's national security, but also the very existence of the virtual currency industry as a legitimate business enterprise.'' Mr. Lawsky's office sent subpoenas to most of the companies that have publicly discussed investing in bitcoin or creating software that would allow for the transfer and exchange of bitcoins. ''It is in the common interest of both the public and the virtual currency industry to bring virtual currencies out of the darkness and into the light of day through enhanced transparency,'' Mr. Lawsky's notice said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Fund to Let Investors Bet on Price Of Bitcoins,"The upstart stock exchange SecondMarket has made a name for itself allowing investors to buy shares of hot private companies like Twitter. Now that those companies are going public, SecondMarket is turning its attention to the next new thing -- bitcoin. On Thursday, SecondMarket is expected to begin raising money for an investment fund -- the first of its kind in the United States -- that will hold only bitcoins, giving wealthy investors exposure to the trendy but controversial virtual currency. The fund, the Bitcoin Investment Trust, aims to provide a reliable and easy way to bet on the future price of bitcoin, a currency generally traded on unregulated, online exchanges based overseas. ''If you speak with people who have tried to purchase bitcoin in the past -- you'll hear, 'it's a difficult process,' 'it's a confusing process,' 'it's a scary process,' '' said Barry Silbert, the chief executive of SecondMarket, based in New York. ''We want to make it an accessible asset class.''  SecondMarket's venture into bitcoin represents the latest effort to bring the virtual currency into the mainstream. But it is also likely to fuel the debate around the legitimacy and legality of a form of money that exists outside the conventional banking system, and has already attracted scrutiny for being used in illicit transactions. Created in 2009 by a still unknown individual, or group, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoins exist only in digital form and can be bought with traditional money through the Internet. New bitcoins are ''mined'' by programmers solving complex math problems. The original programmers determined that only a finite number of bitcoins would be created. While bitcoin is accepted as a form of payment by a growing, but still small number of businesses, it is mostly the domain of speculators, some of whom are drawn to its potential as an alternative to national currencies. The fortunes of bitcoin have in some ways paralleled the postfinancial crisis interest in gold, another asset that has appealed to investors skeptical of the monetary policy of the major central banks. ''It's still at a point where the value is set by what the next guy is willing to pay for it,'' said Brian Riley, senior research director at the CEB TowerGroup. ''Even though it's got the cool factor to it, it's still not a place to park your 401(k).'' Bitcoins gained much wider public exposure this year, when the price doubled and then collapsed over a few weeks. Recently, the price of a single bitcoin has stabilized, trading at $135, down from its peak of more than $250 in April. The total value of all outstanding bitcoins is currently over $1.5 billion. The SecondMarket fund's creation comes just a few months after Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the technology investors best known for their involvement with Facebook, announced the creation of a similar product. The Winklevosses' vehicle, though, will be an exchange traded fund, or E.T.F., accessible to all investors. As a result it must go through a lengthy and uncertain review process with federal regulators. In contrast, the SecondMarket fund can begin raising money immediately because it will be available only to investors who meet a wealth threshold set by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those who qualify, called ''accredited investors,'' must have a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding their primary residence, or annual income of more than $200,000 in each of the previous two years. Mr. Silbert said that because of the risky nature of bitcoins, they should not be sold to ordinary retail investors who could buy E.T.F.'s. ''It's premature for this kind of product to be in the public market,'' Mr. Silbert said. ''It should not be available to unsophisticated investors.'' Mr. Silbert, who started SecondMarket in 2004, has built a business making markets in risky, inaccessible investments. The company operates an exchange on which employees of private companies can sell their shares to wealthy investors, essentially a private-company stock market. This kind of trading exploded in recent years because of the boom in social networking Web sites, driving up the valuations of start-ups like Facebook, Twitter, Groupon and Zynga. Now that all these companies have either gone public or announced their intention to do so, there are questions about how SecondMarket and its ilk will adapt. Its biggest competitor, SharesPost, announced a partnership with Nasdaq to raise the visibility of its private exchange. For SecondMarket, the bitcoin fund signals a push to diversify into new businesses. Beyond its exchange for private company shares, it has facilitated the buying and selling of other hard-to-trade assets like bankruptcy claims and auction rate securities. Another recently created division helps start-ups raise capital. The company has already amassed a $2.25 million stake of bitcoins that will seed the new fund. SecondMarket has spent the last year developing relationships with over a hundred bitcoin players, including programmers, merchants and exchanges. Those relationships should make it easier for the company to quickly find the best price for bitcoin at a given time. SecondMarket says the fund will make it possible for investors to have access to the bitcoin market without dealing with the sometimes unreliable online exchanges and the complex security issues involved in storing digital money. Packaging bitcoins as a fund may also allow the investment to be kept in tax-advantaged retirement account, Mr. Silbert said. SecondMarket's new fund is following in the steps of Exante, a hedge fund operator in Malta. That firm said that its Bitcoin Hedge Fund has amassed 90,000 bitcoins, which would be worth about $12.2 million. Mr. Silbert, 37, has already been involved in the bitcoin world, parlaying his early purchases of the digital money into a broader array of investments in bitcoin-related companies including Coinbase, a bitcoin storage company, and Bitpay, a payment processor. One of the risks for bitcoin investors is the uncertain regulatory environment. A Senate committee and a number of state regulators have been examining whether the currency is evading financial oversight, allowing it to be used by money launderers, tax dodgers and drug traffickers. The world's largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, based in Japan, has had numerous run-ins with American authorities, leading to periodic closings of the service for American customers. On at least one front, though, SecondMarket is taking advantage of relaxed regulations that went into effect just this week letting financial firms publicly market their private funds. But that does not mean that investment experts think the bitcoin fund will be a smart purchase for most investors, even well-heeled ones. ''Just because the S.E.C. now allows a private fund to advertise an offering doesn't mean it's a prudent investment,'' said Jay G. Baris, a lawyer who leads the investment management practice at Morrison & Foerster. ''And investing in bitcoin does not have the same risk profile as investing in a blue chip stock.''

Arrest in U.S. Shuts Down a Black Market for Narcotics,"Nearly everything about Silk Road was shrouded in secrecy. It began in 2011 as an underground online marketplace for drug users, a site where endless varieties of marijuana -- as well as LSD, ecstasy and prescription pills -- could be bought from sellers across the world. It branched out to other illicit goods, including forged documents, and emerged as a black market version of eBay, where criminals could do business with more than 100,000 customers. It worked on one basic principle: Everyone remained anonymous. Users could gain access to the network only through software meant to ensure anonymity. Credit cards and PayPal were not accepted. Bitcoins, a virtual currency, were, and even those transactions were scrambled. All that connected them in real life was a name, often fake, and the address to which the package would be sent. And the mastermind behind Silk Road was cloaked in mystery, known as Dread Pirate Roberts, after a character in the movie ''The Princess Bride.'' But Silk Road went dark this week, and its owner was unmasked as Ross Ulbricht, 29, who is accused in a criminal complaint, among other things, of asking a man to kill a Silk Road vendor who had threatened to reveal the identities of others who used the site.  In another case, Mr. Ulbricht is accused of asking an undercover agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to kill a former Silk Road employee whom Mr. Ulbricht feared would become a government witness, according to an indictment. F.B.I. agents confronted Mr. Ulbricht in a library in San Francisco on Tuesday and arrested him on narcotics and money-laundering charges. The case, which is being coordinated by federal prosecutors in New York, is part of a larger push by federal authorities to police elicit commerce along the frontier of the Internet. A few high-profile cases have involved defendants overseas, which made it all the more noteworthy that the man accused of being behind Silk Road was in the United States and remained undetected for so long. He had been living with his parents in Austin, Tex., until last fall, when he moved to San Francisco to tap into its entrepreneurial spirit. ''I feel like the world is in flux,'' Mr. Ulbricht said, in a lengthy discussion with a childhood friend, Rene Pinnell, that appeared on YouTube last year. ''I want to see where all this new technology goes.'' His goals included starting a family, making more friends and having ''a substantial positive impact on the future of humanity,'' according to the video, which makes no mention of Silk Road. In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Pinnell said that ''Ross is the most principled, honest person I've ever had the pleasure to know.'' Referring to the government's charges, Mr. Pinnell said Mr. Ulbricht ''would never do anything like that.'' Mr. Ulbricht carved out an anonymous life in San Francisco. He rented a room and told his two housemates that his name was Josh, the authorities said. One roommate reported that ''Josh'' was always home in his room on the computer. There, according to the federal complaint, he made a lot of money. The F.B.I. was able to obtain an image of the Silk Road's Web server, which indicated the site had sales revenue of more than 9.5 million bitcoins, valued at about $1.2 billion today, though the total worth was most likely less at the time of the sales, according to the complaint. Bitcoins also have had a strong following among young, technologically proficient libertarians who are attracted to a currency that is not connected to any government. According to technology experts, Silk Road was responsible for something approaching half of all transactions involving bitcoins. Investigators believe Mr. Ulbricht collected commissions of more than 600,000 bitcoins, the equivalent of $80 million, which they are trying to gain access to. So far, the authorities have seized 26,000 bitcoins, worth about $3.6 million, from escrow accounts into which Silk Road buyers placed funds. In an interview in Forbes magazine in September, Dread Pirate Roberts, the pseudonym authorities say Mr. Ulbricht adopted, spoke of Silk Road as a so-called disrupter of social norms. ''We're talking about the potential for a monumental shift in the power structure of the world,'' Roberts said. ''The people now can control the flow and distribution of information and the flow of money. Sector by sector, the state is being cut out of the equation.'' It appears Mr. Ulbricht forgot at times to cover his digital footsteps: investigators discovered that his personal e-mail account was linked to some early efforts to promote Silk Road. The court papers filed in the case make clear that federal authorities have been after Silk Road for some time. Undercover agents have made more than 100 drug purchases from Silk Road vendors, whose packages arrived in New York bearing the postal markings of 10 countries. Steven Kalar, the federal public defender in San Francisco, said his office represented Mr. Ulbricht in his preliminary appearances in Federal District Court on Wednesday. Mr. Kalar declined to comment further. But even as the federal agents were trying to build a case against Silk Road, it was threatened from within. Earlier this year, a Silk Road vendor who went by the handle FriendlyChemist began telling Mr. Ulbricht ''that he had a long list of real names and addresses of Silk Road vendors and customers that he had obtained from hacking into the computer of another, larger Silk Road vendor,'' according to the complaint. FriendlyChemist threatened to publish the information unless he received $500,000, according to the complaint. Mr. Ulbricht began messaging with one of FriendlyChemist's purported creditors. In one message, detailed in the complaint, Mr. Ulbricht wrote, ''FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn't mind if he was executed.'' He passed along what he knew about FriendlyChemist: a name and that he lived in White Rock, British Columbia. He paid $150,000 worth of bitcoins to the creditor, who was known to Mr. Ulbricht by the handle redandwhite, to carry out the murder, according to the complaint. But what happened next remains unclear, according to court papers filed in the case. Mr. Ulbricht received ''a picture of the victim after the job was done.'' But Agent Christopher Tarbell, who swore out the criminal complaint, said the Canadian authorities had no record of a homicide occurring near White Rock around that time. In July, investigators with the Department of Homeland Security showed up at Mr. Ulbricht's home after a routine border search of mail from Canada turned up a number of counterfeit identity documents bearing Mr. Ulbricht's photograph and his address. He told the investigators little but volunteered that, hypothetically, anyone could get forged identity documents on a Web site called Silk Road. "
Bitcoin Pursues the Mainstream,"The currency known as bitcoin -- a much-hyped and much-doubted type of digital cash that can be bought with traditional money -- has mostly attracted attention for its popularity in the black market, and for its wildly gyrating valuation. But some entrepreneurs, investors and even merchants are eyeing a far more mainstream use for it. They are convinced that bitcoin, though not widely understood, offers a path to lower payment processing and more secure transactions. Instead of using bitcoin to buy illegal guns in the recesses of the web, they say, ordinary consumers will use it to buy legal goods from legal retailers -- and as easily as they now swipe their credit cards or exchange paper bills. ''I'm confident you will see major worldwide retailers adopting systems built on bitcoin,'' said Jim Breyer, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist and early Facebook investor who also served on the board of Walmart Stores for more than a decade.  Mr. Breyer is an investor in Circle Internet Financial, one of the host of start-ups trying to find a way to make bitcoin a widely adopted currency for retail payments. The company was started by Jeremy Allaire, a serial entrepreneur, and it aims to be a payment processing system for online and physical merchants, similar to the service PayPal offers online. Along with his venture firm, Accel Partners, and another called General Catalyst Partners, Mr. Breyer has invested $9 million in the company. One potential obstacle to mainstream acceptance of bitcoin is the sometimes wild fluctuations in its value, which makes it alluring to currency speculators but could scare off ordinary consumers. One bitcoin was worth just over $200 Wednesday afternoon. Someone who bought a bitcoin in early April paid as much as $266 for it. Only a small and motley assortment of merchants now accept bitcoin as payment, and in many cases they do it largely as a marketing strategy. The list includes a winery in British Columbia, the popular online dating site OkCupid and a Seattle lunch truck that specializes in grilled cheese sandwiches. A start-up called Gyft lets people buy electronic gift cards for major retailers with bitcoin, and this week an A.T.M. in Vancouver, Canada, began issuing bitcoin to people in exchange for cash. ''We pride ourselves on being the nerdiest online dating site,'' said Sam Yagan, co-founder of OkCupid, which is owned by IAC/InterActiveCorp, a media and Internet company. ''We were like, 'This is cool and we should do it.' '' Since bitcoin emerged in 2009, many of those who flocked to the currency celebrated it for being beyond the clutches of governments and other institutions. Until recently, the currency lubricated transactions on Silk Road, one of the Web's biggest bazaars for drugs, forged documents and other contraband. The site was shut down in early October by federal authorities. New bitcoin is created on computers connected through a peer-to-peer network. An algorithm controls the production of new bitcoin, which is meant to mitigate the risk of inflation. Already, though, businesses transferring and exchanging bitcoin find themselves in regulators' cross hairs. In March, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, part of the Treasury Department, issued guidelines telling businesses involved in the exchange of digital currencies that they needed to register as money services businesses and comply with a variety of rules to prevent money laundering. New York's Department of Financial services began an inquiry in August to determine guidelines for digital currency businesses, issuing nearly two dozen subpoenas to start-ups, investors and others involved in the emerging field. Patrick M. Byrne, chief executive of the online retailer Overstock.com, said his company was talking about accepting bitcoin, but it decided to pause its plans until legal matters around the currency were clarified. Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, a start-up that helps merchants accept bitcoin and helps consumers obtain it by exchanging traditional currencies, said he thought the demise of Silk Road gave entrepreneurs and investors more confidence in bitcoin. ''The bad guys basically lost,'' said Mr. Ehrsam, whose start-up has raised over $6 million from Union Square Ventures and others. ''It took the single most illegitimate player in the space and wiped them off the map.'' Bitcoin advocates, and especially merchants, say one of the currency's most enticing promises is that it could significantly lower payment processing costs. Retailers typically pay 2 to 3 percent of the value of a customer sale when a credit card is used. Retailers have long complained about these fees and have sought other options, but without much luck. PayPal, the online payment system, typically charges merchants a fee between 2.2 percent and 2.9 percent, as well as a per-transaction fee of 30 cents. ''There have been a number of alternative currencies talked about over time,'' said Chris Monteiro, a spokesman for MasterCard. ''The bottom line is consumers want a payment solution that is safe, simple to use and universally accepted.'' Fees for a merchant accepting bitcoin payments often range from nothing to less than 2 percent because of the open nature of the technology. Coinbase, for example, said it did not charge its merchants for the first $1 million in sales, imposing a 1 percent fee after that on the conversion of bitcoin into local currency. Circle said it had not settled on pricing for merchants, but that it would charge them a fee to use its system that would be well below credit card transaction costs. Mr. Allaire and others predict that merchants will encourage customers to spend bitcoin by passing some of the savings on to them in the form of lower prices or other rewards. ''Bitcoin definitely addresses a need,'' said Simon Johnson, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. ''The payments industry is ready to be disrupted.'' The fluctuating value of bitcoin has not stopped some investors. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twin brothers who tangled with Mark Zuckerberg over the founding of Facebook, have said they are big holders of bitcoin and have filed a proposal with securities regulators that would let investors trade bitcoin as if it were stocks. Other challenges face Circle and other start-ups building new payment systems. For example, it can take several business days to link someone's bank account to their bitcoin. Mr. Allaire of Circle said one of his goals was to make that initial setup much faster. Mr. Allaire also said his company, which is based in Boston, will protect its customers' bitcoin by creating ''offline reserves'' -- batches of the digital currency on physical storage devices, like a hard drive, not connected to the Internet. The offline bitcoin reserves will be protected by armed guards, he said. George Peabody, senior director at Glenbrook Partners, a consultancy in the payments industry, said Circle was a sign of the maturation of entrepreneurs entering the bitcoin market. Mr. Allaire was an early web entrepreneur, founding a web application development company, Allaire Corporation, that went public in 1999 and was sold to Macromedia. An Internet video company he created, Brightcove, went public last year. Mr. Allaire said he was convinced that bitcoin represented another major technological development. ''It's similar to me in import as the web browser,'' he said. ''It's as exciting and significant as that.'' "
The Rush to Coin Virtual Money With Real Value,"Updated, 5:46 p.m. | If cash is king, virtual cash may be the crown prince in waiting. Programmers around the world have been churning out new digital currencies that try to improve on the concept of bitcoin, the hot but controversial virtual money that has swept the Internet. As questions still swirl around bitcoin's legality, many technology entrepreneurs are trying to sidestep the currency's pitfalls by devising new ways to make payments in a cashless future. Already, dozens of ideas are jockeying for the market. At last count, a website that tracks the market, coinmarketcap.com, listed 36 so-called crypto-currencies, with names like bitbar, freicoin and cryptogenic bullion, and new ones are being added each month. Collectively, these digital moneys had a recent market value of about $4.3 billion, of which $4.1 billion was from the dominant currency, bitcoin.  The online payment system viewed by many insiders as having the best chance of supplanting bitcoin, however, is not even on the list: Ripple. Founded in San Francisco by former bitcoin developers, Ripple holds out the promise not just of a new currency, but also of a novel method to send money around the world. With that potential, it is winning something that has proved elusive for virtual currencies: involvement from more mainstream players in the financial system. ''I haven't seen anything else as interesting as Ripple,'' said Jesse Powell, the founder of Payward, which runs an exchange where digital currencies can be bought and sold. ''As far as I'm concerned, bitcoin and Ripple are the only ones that have a real shot at being a big deal.'' On Tuesday, the company overseeing Ripple's development, Ripple Labs, will announce $3.5 million in financing from six new investors. The company will also announce that it has attracted funds from Pantera Capital, which includes money from executives at the Fortress Investment Group. Chris Larsen, the co-founder of Ripple Labs, said the company had also been talking with banks large and small about joining Ripple's payment network. ''There's a lot of interest from the big banks in what's going on here,'' said Mr. Larsen, who previously founded two financial start-ups. ''I've never seen anything like it before.'' The rapidly growing industry of alternative currencies owes a lot of credit to bitcoin's surprising success. Bitcoin has confronted a number of issues that have led to market crashes, but has recovered each time. The latest stumble came after the founder of a popular online marketplace, known as Silk Road, was arrested and accused of using bitcoin to traffic in drugs and other illegal goods. The price of an individual bitcoin initially dropped after Silk Road was shut down, but since then it has risen steadily and recently stood around $260, near a record high. Still, the entire world of virtual currencies could be rendered irrelevant almost overnight if law enforcement agencies decided to crack down on transactions. Several state and federal authorities have said that they are looking at how to police the market, worried that the anonymous nature of the online transactions make the currencies attractive for criminals. A recent study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego found that most bitcoin transactions were being used for gambling. Even without such legal hurdles, some critics expect that virtual currencies will eventually come to be seen as a speculative bubble with no foundation. ''It really does sound 21st century, but at the end of the day, do you really want to put your money at stake in that?'' said Brian Riley, who covers payment systems for CEB TowerGroup. Despite the questions, the concept of digital currencies has won a growing number of proponents. In the technology sector, many have been drawn to the broader possibility that virtual currencies could allow money to zip around the world without going through banks and payment processors, with all the fees they impose, not to mention onerous government regulations. One set of competitors are the so-called centralized currencies, which are operated and overseen from a single hub. These work like the loyalty points distributed and overseen by airlines or retailers and can allow regulators to keep a closer eye on transactions. One such currency, known as ven, is tied to a basket of global currencies that keeps the price stable. But most online entrepreneurs are dismissive of centralized currencies, saying they give too much power to the companies that run them. Prosecutors have said that one centralized currency service, Liberty Reserve, was devised solely to evade government authorities. Its co-founder, Vladimir Kats, pleaded guilty to money laundering last month in federal court in Manhattan. In recent months, there has been much more excitement in the industry about decentralized currencies, which exist independently of any company. Such platforms have computer code that is usually open source, or available for editing by any programmer. This setup is seen as a benefit because it means that no central authority can determine things like fees, and who can and cannot have access to the currency. One of the most popular decentralized currencies is litecoin, which was founded by a former Google programmer and intended to improve on some of the flaws in bitcoin, like the somewhat slow transaction times. Mr. Powell of Payward and many other industry experts, though, say that litecoin and competitors are just tweaked versions of bitcoin. Ripple is being heralded in some quarters as a more significant innovation than its competitors. Ripple maintains not only a currency, but also a system on which any currency, even bitcoin, can be moved around or traded -- akin to a cross between Western Union and a currency exchange, without the hefty fees. A person using the system can deposit any sort of money into a personal Ripple wallet through a business that is signed up as a Ripple gateway. That money can then be moved to the wallet of another Ripple user, without going through a bank or a credit card system. People moving the same type of currency, say dollars or pounds, to another account on the Ripple system will not have to use its currency, known as ripple or xrp, pronounced letter by letter. But ripple is meant to provide the fastest and cheapest conversions, of one nation's currency to another or among various types of digital money. The hope is that once people begin using ripple they will keep some of their money in the currency and eventually use it directly to make purchases. Stefan Thomas, an early bitcoin programmer and now the chief technology officer of Ripple Labs, said he was drawn to the company because it improved on the flaws in bitcoin. For instance, he said, users of Ripple put money into the system through so-called gateways, which should allow regulators to monitor transactions more easily. Ripple also does away with the process of ''mining'' bitcoins, which has eaten up enormous computing power. ''You kept running into the same criticism,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''Now there is a thing that has solved all these problems in a fundamental way.'' As with bitcoin, a finite number of ripple will be created -- 100 billion. Ripple Labs will distribute 55 percent of those free to encourage people and companies to use the system. The 7.5 billion ripple that have been released are worth about $60 million. The company, with 25 employees, is keeping 25 percent of the currency to sell off to fund its operations. This setup has drawn criticism from some supporters of bitcoin, who think it gives too much power to Mr. Larsen's company. But the company will also allow for quicker and more coordinated responses to crises and regulators. Angela Angelovska Wilson, a lawyer at Latham & Watkins specializing in alternative payment systems, said that Ripple's more centralized control had allowed it to benefit from some of the bad press surrounding bitcoin, while maintaining the benefits of a decentralized currency. ''Obviously bitcoin was the first mover,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''But Ripple was right behind it. And then there are a lot of others coming through.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Virtual Money Draws Notice Of Regulators,"Updated, 8:15 p.m. | New York's top financial regulator is looking at issuing a ''BitLicense'' for businesses that conduct transactions in virtual currencies like bitcoin.  Benjamin M. Lawsky, the state's superintendent of financial services, announced on Thursday that he would conduct a public hearing to discuss the expanding world of digital money. Participants will discuss the feasibility of a license that would make the virtual currency market more like those for other forms of money. If the plans go ahead, it would be an important step in bringing bitcoin and other virtual currencies closer to the financial mainstream. In another move in the same direction, the Federal Election Commission held a hearing on Thursday at which it considered whether to legalize campaign donations made in virtual currencies. Since bitcoin was created in 2009 by anonymous programmers, it has been treated with derision by many financial insiders and authorities, who have described it as a speculative mania. Many authorities still hold to that position, but the currency's online network, which is not controlled by any centralized authority, has survived several crises. On Thursday, the value of a single bitcoin was trading near a record high, at $425, on the exchange Mt. Gox. The price has skyrocketed in recent weeks. Several regulators have been looking at ways to make sure virtual money cannot be used for laundering money or other criminal purposes. In October, the federal authorities arrested the operator of an online marketplace where they said bitcoin could be used to buy drugs and other illegal goods. ''The cloak of anonymity provided by virtual currencies has helped support dangerous criminal activity, such as drug smuggling, money laundering, gunrunning and child pornography,'' Mr. Lawsky said in a letter announcing the hearing, which has not yet been scheduled. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Regulators See Value in Bitcoin, And Investors Hasten to Agree","The virtual currency bitcoin took a big step toward the mainstream on Monday as federal authorities signaled their willingness to accept it as a legitimate payment alternative. A number of federal officials told a Senate hearing that such financial networks offered real benefits for the financial system even as they acknowledged that new forms of digital money had provided avenues for money laundering and illegal activity. ''There are plenty of opportunities for digital currencies to operate within existing laws and regulations,'' said Edward Lowery, a special agent with the Secret Service, which is tasked with protecting the integrity of the dollar.  Signs that the government would not stand in the way of bitcoin's development, even as it has been cracking down on criminal networks that use the digital money, stoked a strong rally in the price of the crypto-currency. By Monday evening, the value of a bitcoin unit soared past $700 on some exchanges. The total outstanding pool of bitcoin -- which is created by a network of users who solve complex mathematical problems -- is now worth more than $7 billion. The Senate hearing Monday afternoon was the clearest indication yet of the government's desire to grapple with the consequences of this growth, and the recognition that bitcoin and other similar networks could become more lasting and significant parts of the financial landscape. ''The decision to bring virtual currency within the scope of our regulatory framework should be viewed by those who respect and obey the basic rule of law as a positive development for this sector,'' said Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. ''It recognizes the innovation virtual currencies provide, and the benefits they might offer.'' Ms. Shasky Calvery and the other officials at the hearing did say that basic questions still had to be answered about virtual currencies, including whether they can actually be considered currencies or whether they are more properly categorized as commodities or securities. The distinction will determine which agencies regulate the networks and how they are treated under tax law. Ms. Shasky Calvery said that the Internal Revenue Service was ''actively working'' on its own rules for bitcoin. The hearing followed other less visible steps taken by regulators and lawmakers to bring digital money into the mainstream. New York State's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, said last week that he would hold a hearing to consider the creation of a BitLicense to provide more oversight for transactions. Earlier, the Federal Election Commission put out an advisory indicating that bitcoin could be legally accepted as political donations. The general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit advocating the currency, said in his testimony on Monday that he was receiving a much more friendly response from both government and the financial industry. ''We have recently perceived a marked improvement in the tone and tenor taken by both state officials and bank executives,'' the general counsel, Patrick Murck, said. Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable ascent since it was created in 2009 by an anonymous programmer or collective known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The money, which is not tied to any national currency, has been popular with technophiles who are skeptical of the world's central banks. Only a finite amount of bitcoin will ever be created -- 21 million units. Users have bid up the price on Internet exchanges, betting that the currency will be more widely used in the future. There are significant questions about the wisdom of the digital money as an investment, given that bitcoin has no intrinsic value and has proved to be vulnerable to hackers. Many money managers have recommended that unsophisticated investors stay away. Recently, though, bitcoin has been catching fire around the world, with exchanges in China particularly active. A growing number of prominent American investors have also bought stakes, including Michael Novogratz, a principal at the private equity and hedge fund giant Fortress Investment Group, as well as the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler. The increasingly widespread ownership of bitcoin has shifted attention away from the criminal enterprises that have used digital money, but it was a focus at the Senate hearing. Last month, the online marketplace Silk Road, where bitcoin was the primary form of payment, was shut down and its founder arrested after authorities accused it of being used to buy and sell drugs, weapons and pornography. The chairman of the Senate committee, Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said that a few days after the arrest, a similar site sprang up. It can be harder to track criminals who use bitcoin, law enforcement officials said at the hearing, because they operate across international borders and often do not use established financial institutions that report transactions. But Mythili Raman, an assistant attorney general at the Justice Department, also said that because every bitcoin transaction was recorded on a public ledger, it was possible for investigators to trace the movement of money between accounts. ''It is not in fact anonymous. It is not immune from investigation,'' Ms. Raman said. All the officials at the hearing said that crime had been an issue during the early days of credit cards and online payment systems like PayPal, and should not be a reason to limit innovation. ''It is our duty as law enforcement to stay vigilant while recognizing that there are many legitimate users of those services,'' Ms. Raman said. The bitcoin supporters who testified at the hearing said bitcoin could bring major changes to the financial system by cutting out the middle men needed to move money around the world. ''I am here to testify because I believe that global digital currency represents one of the most important technical and economic innovations of our time,'' said Jeremy Allaire, the chief executive of Circle Internet Financial, which is seeking to promote more widespread use of the currency. Given bitcoin's appeal to skeptics of government, many aficionados have been wary of involvement by Washington. But advocates at the hearing said that the increasing cooperation with regulators could lay the groundwork for further growth. ''As this technology moves from early adopters into mainstream acceptance, it is critical in my view that federal and state governments establish policies surrounding digital currency,'' Mr. Allaire said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Heads, It's Excitement. Tails, It's Anxiety.","Bitcoin isn't ready for popular consumption, and it may never be. It doesn't fit into a neat product category. Often called a virtual currency, it's not legal tender anywhere on the planet. It's not an income-generating asset class suitable for most investors. Its value, in dollars, fluctuates wildly from one minute to the next. And while it can be a cheap way of transferring money, there are too many glitches in its emerging network for bitcoin to be entirely reliable. Even its advocates have been raising red flags. As Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit devoted to ''fostering the bitcoin ecosystem,'' acknowledged in a Senate hearing last week, ''It's very much still an experimental currency and it should be considered a high-risk environment for consumers and investors at the moment.'' Yet bitcoin has been receiving plenty of attention, and not just because well-publicized speculators have been making money on it.  High-risk experiment though it may be, bitcoin embodies an elegant and disruptive technology. It uses file-sharing, the peer-to-peer computer innovation that spawned early music services like Napster, Kazaa and LimeWire. In their early days, they sometimes walked on the wild side, but their experiences led to a wholesale digital transformation of the music business. Bitcoin gives file-sharing a brilliant twist. In essence, it has created ''a decentralized virtual currency that uses a peer-to-peer consensus system to confirm and verify transactions,'' two researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis concluded in a recent study. And François R. Velde, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, made this assessment in a new report on bitcoin: ''It represents a remarkable conceptual and technical achievement, which may well be used by existing financial institutions (which could issue their own bitcoins) or even by governments themselves.'' Bitcoin's advantages as a low-cost means of transferring money have intrigued a number of corporate clients of the law firm Proskauer, though none of them are using it, said Jeffrey D. Neuberger, co-chairman of the firm's technology, media and communications group. ''It's an early-stage technology,'' he said. ''But it could be revolutionary.'' In short, in a world that some people consider almost as important as music -- the precincts of money and finance -- bitcoin, or a successor technology that shares its DNA, is given a good chance of influencing the future. That's what made last week's hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee so intriguing. It assessed the ''potential risks, threats and promises of virtual currencies,'' with bitcoin foremost among them. So what is bitcoin today? Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware and chairman of the committee, acknowledged that he wasn't sure how to make sense of it: ''Virtual currencies, perhaps most notably bitcoin, have captured the imagination of some, struck fear among others and confused the heck out of the rest of us, including me.'' The Senate committee's attempt to get a grip on the digital currency was, in a way, the first step in what will surely be a continuing tension. On one side are those seeking ease and anonymity in transactions; on the other is the government. Speculators and money launderers have already found much to like about the relatively anonymous digital currency, and that has forced the government to play catch-up. Bitcoin allowed the website Silk Road, which the government shut down in October, to become ''the largest illegal drug and contraband marketplace on the Internet,'' according to Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. While it was in business, customers ''were required to pay in bitcoins to enable both the operator of Silk Road and its sellers to evade detection and launder hundreds of millions of dollars,'' she said. The virtual currency isn't impervious to determined government snooping, however. ''We are innovating as criminals are innovating,'' said Mythili Raman, an acting assistant attorney general, at the hearing. Individual bitcoin transactions are encoded, but large numbers of them may be compared statistically with other databases available to the government, and patterns will emerge, several experts said. While bitcoin users need a secret, numerical key to unlock their accounts, the anonymity of the system is vulnerable when the virtual currency is exchanged into dollars. Federal and state authorities are requiring firms that exchange bitcoin into currency, or use it to transfer funds, to comply with existing regulations. But when the movement from bitcoin to hard currency takes place in a country where American authorities don't have access, ''there may be opportunities for money-laundering,'' said Mr. Neuberger at Proskauer. The S.E.C., for its part, has been warning investors of the danger of ''potential investment scams'' involving bitcoin and other virtual currencies. In one case, it has charged Trendon T. Shavers, a Texas man, with running a bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme with the promise of vast riches. ''Con men read the headlines like everyone else,'' said Lori Schock, director of the S.E.C.'s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. ''Bitcoins sound sexy and new, but at the end of the day, if they're making claims about limitless wealth from unregistered investments it comes down to an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme.'' The agency is also studying a legitimate bitcoin proposal by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the technology investors best known for their involvement with Facebook, to open an exchange-traded fund, or E.T.F., that tracks the bitcoin market. If the E.T.F. is ever approved, a fund based on a volatile virtual currency is hardly likely to be a safe, core holding for buy-and-hold investors. In the meantime, the virtual currency's soaring value has inspired tales like this one: Kristoffer Koch, 29, of Oslo, told the BBC last month that he bought $22 worth of the currency while doing technical research on it four years ago. He promptly forgot about it. When he unlocked his long dormant account recently, it was worth $850,000. Even with all of its problems, the eventual creation of a reliable, decentralized, peer-shared, computer-based currency remains the holy grail in some circles. Back in 1999, Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate who remains the guiding light of many libertarians, predicted its eventual arrival. He saw the Internet as a congenial environment for innovators. Markets would flourish in cyberspace, freeing people from what he considered the stifling grasp of a paternalistic and inefficient government. But one ingredient was missing, he said. He called it ''a reliable e-cash.'' What was required, he said, was e-cash that enabled you to ''transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A -- the way in which I can take a $20 bill and hand it over to you and there's no record of where it came from. And you may get that without knowing who I am.'' Unfortunately, that would create new problems, he said, because such a currency would have ''a negative side.'' ''The gangsters,'' he said, ''the people who are engaging in illegal transactions, will also have an easier way to carry on their business.'' That tension is part of progress, he said. It may be where we find ourselves now. "
In Bitcoin's Orbit,"For many people, bitcoin seems like something from the day after tomorrow. For Lawrence Blankenship, it's already a thing of the past. A software engineer from Springfield, Mo., Mr. Blankenship is putting his money on PeerCoin, one of the biggest of the virtual currencies that are being promoted as alternatives to bitcoin. With mounting interest from prominent investors and growing acceptance from regulators, bitcoin -- either the new gold or the next Dutch tulip craze, depending on who is being asked -- is at the center of the virtual money universe. Yet there are dozens of digital alternatives, like PeerCoin, Litecoin and anoncoin, whose backers point to advantages they say their currency has over bitcoin. PeerCoin, according to Mr. Blankenship, is closer than bitcoin to the perfect, communal money. Mr. Blankenship, who is 34, has arranged to accept PeerCoin as the virtual currency of choice at a Star Trek convention he is organizing in his hometown.  ''Looking down the road 10 years from now, I definitely see bitcoin being ousted,'' he said. ''Everyone's going to start switching to other coins, and hopefully PeerCoin comes out ahead in that.'' In the alternative galaxy of virtual currencies, newly created money can become worth millions of real dollars in a few months. All the PeerCoin in existence, for example, was worth nearly $40 million last week. Programmers and mathematicians release new entrants into the field almost every week. On one popular exchange, Cryptsy, 60 different coins can now be traded. Almost all of these altcoins, as they are known, have fed on the stratospheric rise of bitcoin. Since the beginning of the month, the value of bitcoin rose to more than $900 at one point, from $200, and it is up 6,000 percent since the beginning of the year. Many of the altcoins have risen at the same clip, driven by bets that the Internet has room for more than one form of virtual money, or that bitcoin can be overtaken. The constant innovation opens the door to new opportunities for fraud and illegal activities. Thanks to a lack of regulation, pump-and-dump schemes have become common. But the thousands of hours being poured into these projects underscore the degree to which a small but growing community believes that it has found the future of money. ''It's a very intriguing thing, because in principle, you can have a kind of money with some advantages that have never been possessed by any past forms of money,'' said George Selgin, an economics professor at the University of Georgia at Athens. If this is a contest, bitcoin is still light-years ahead of any of its competitors -- the value of all bitcoin is measured in the billions of dollars, while only a few others have even cracked a hundred million. And bitcoin has the basic attributes that most other coins are trying to imitate: an open-source computer code with no central authority and a mathematically determined rate of expansion, not relying on a central bank. What's more, most altcoins share the biggest weakness of bitcoin: a violently fluctuating value. Most people are willing to use real currencies because they have stable values that make them good units of exchange. Virtual currencies, these days, are more like speculative commodities. But this is not stopping the ascent of things like Litecoin, which is generally viewed as the second-most-popular digital money, with a total value of about $250 million last week. Unlike bitcoin, which was invented by a shadowy creator known only as Satoshi Nakamoto, Litecoin was created by Charles Lee, a 36-year-old former programmer at Google who lives with his wife and two children in Silicon Valley. Mr. Lee said he wrote the original code for Litecoin in the hours after his children had gone to sleep. At the time, he said, many of the new currencies were being created by people who kept large hoards of the money they created, and then cashed out as soon as it rose in value. Mr. Lee, by contrast, gave advance notice of Litecoin's release, and on that day he began with no coins himself. Like bitcoin, new Litecoin is created through a so-called mining process in which computers compete to solve math problems, with coins going to the first computer that succeeds. The goal with Litecoin, Mr. Lee said, was not to replace bitcoin. Instead, it was to be ''silver to bitcoin's gold,'' with faster-moving transactions and a more democratic mining process. ''People like choices,'' said Mr. Lee, who now works for Coinbase, a company that provides virtual currency wallets. ''You want to diversify your crypto-currency investments.'' Another virtual currency viewed as being in the top ranks is Ripple, which is at the center of a new online payment system also called Ripple. This has won some mainstream following because it has big Silicon Valley backers and promises to be more transparent and easier to regulate than bitcoin. Bitcoin has been criticized for the anonymity of its transactions, which have made it attractive for buying drugs and guns online. But many altcoin fans are more bothered by how easily governments can follow bitcoin, because the transactions are all recorded on a public ledger. This was the motivation for the creators of anoncoin, which has been rising in value. Not surprisingly, the person behind anoncoin's email address did not want to share his or her identity. But the person, going by the name Meeh, said the team behind anoncoin was ''just people trying to help people become anonymous in this over-surveillanced world.'' PeerCoin, Mr. Blankenship's money of choice, also has a creator who refuses to be identified, going by the name Sunny King. In an Internet chat, Sunny King said one of the goals with PeerCoin was to create money that did not require the same computer resources to mine -- making it more environmentally sustainable. More recently, Sunny King released a second new currency, Primecoin, that forces miners to find new strings of prime numbers -- a potentially valuable task for the mathematical world. ''We are not greedy,'' Sunny King said. ''We think crypto-currency also needs moral character behind it.'' Mr. Blankenship is pushing for Sunny King's currencies and so are some friends in Springfield. One of those friends, John Manglaviti, said he dedicated 30 hours a week to promoting PeerCoin, after his day job, and thinks it could be ''right there as an alternative to bitcoin.'' First, though, he said, the ''challenge is to take this out of the geek world and make it something my mom could use.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Render Unto Caesar, But Who Backs Bitcoin?","How can bitcoin be anything but a passing fad? It seems you can't open a newspaper or read a website these days without hearing about the super-yet-mysterious virtual currency known as bitcoin. Everyone's talking about it. Richard Branson just began accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for flights on Virgin Galactic, which offers commercial spaceflights. The Chinese website Baidu endorsed the currency, and lawmakers in Washington are holding hearings about it. Even Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told senators in a letter that virtual currencies ''may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.'' And then, of course, there is the sky-high march of the value of bitcoin. A year ago, bitcoin was worth a couple of bucks. Today bitcoin goes for $800 each, depending on the day. And the value can swing by more than $100 a day, if not more.  If it all feels a bit like a 1999-style craze, that's because it is. Peter Leeds of the Penny Stock newsletter put it to me this way: ''In a matter of months you won't be hearing about it. It will go the same way of Paris Hilton. People will move on to the next thing.'' That's not to say there aren't fervent believers. Bitcoin's early success was a result, in part, of an angry libertarian strain of investor looking for an alternative to the dollar, something akin to a digital version of gold, in the event the world comes to an end -- or starts to look like a Keanu Reeves movie. But there seems to be a disconnect between the idea of what makes a great investment -- or a great speculation -- and a new currency that will be universally accepted. Bitcoin, in the short or even long term, may turn out be a good investment in the same way that anything that is rare can be considered valuable. Like baseball cards. Or a Picasso. That's because there are only so many of them. But bitcoin aspires to be much more than a collectible, or frankly, even gold. It aspires to be a universal electronic currency. On that score, it is unlikely to succeed. Why? Let's start with bitcoin's value -- or more accurately, the volatility of its value. Which merchants in their right mind are going to accept a currency that seemingly changes its value in wild swings every other day? Mr. Branson's experience with bitcoin is instructive: While he happily accepted bitcoin as a form of payment, he quickly converted the payment into dollars. That doesn't make bitcoin a currency. It makes it a way for merchants, like Shopify -- which also accepts bitcoin -- to get a little publicity. Then there is the issue of how limited the supply of bitcoin truly is. Bitcoin is digitally ''mined'' by computers running an algorithm. (If you just rolled your eyes, you're not alone.) The algorithm limits the total number of bitcoin ever mined to 21 million units. But there is no Bernanke (or Janet Yellen) of bitcoin. Nobody knows who created it and no one controls it. That's supposed to be a benefit. It's also why the currency is often associated with illicit sales. Bitcoin can be transferred anonymously and without banks taking transaction fees. But if, and this is a big if, your peer-to-peer transaction doesn't work properly, there is no central clearinghouse to complain to. Whether the government ultimately seeks to regulate bitcoin is an open question. It seems hard to believe that the government would allow the growth of such an unregulated market in which moms and pops, widows and orphans, and other individuals may be subject to all kinds of fraud. Oddly, the Chinese government has seemingly embraced the early use of bitcoin. Gordon G. Chang, writing in Forbes, has a provocative explanation for that stance: ''Digital money can undermine the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. Bitcoin is on track to becoming the world's first trillion-dollar nonfiat form of money.'' Finally, there is the question of what happens if other alternative digital currencies also rise. More than a dozen digital currencies are trying to compete with bitcoin. Can you imagine a world in which we all transact with dozens of different currencies every day with different rules? Neither can I. ''Every big idea starts out sounding crazy. But not every crazy-sounding idea ends up being big,'' Matthew O'Brien wrote in The Atlantic in a brilliant takedown of bitcoin. In truth, the best bitcoin can hope for is to be a second-rate version of gold, if that. And Warren Buffett once described gold this way: ''Gold gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.'' That's pretty much the way a Martian might think about bitcoin. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Much Ado About Bitcoin,"Adrian Chen is a freelance journalist and an editor at The New Inquiry.; Thomas L. Friedman is off today. FOR the obsessive followers of the volatile virtual currency bitcoin, the price of a single bitcoin at the time their fixation began holds undue significance. I know one bitcoin cost around $9 when I first stumbled on it in the summer of 2011. That was before I single-handedly sent the price of bitcoin soaring. I wasn't trying to manipulate an underground economy. I was just doing my job as a blogger for the website Gawker when I broke the story of the online underground illegal drug market Silk Road, on which bitcoin was the only accepted currency because of its relative anonymity. The article went viral and introduced hundreds of thousands to bitcoin.  Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, helped, too. During a news conference a couple of days after my article was published, he called bitcoin ''an online form of money laundering.'' I suppose a lot of people thought that sounded pretty cool. The price of bitcoin surged to $14. Huh, I thought, maybe I should buy some bitcoin. But I didn't, and as of this writing, one bitcoin is worth around $880. Senate hearings held to discuss regulating bitcoin earlier this month were ''lovefests,'' according to The Washington Post. Abroad, Chinese investors are flocking. Bitcoin seems on the brink of respectability. Still, there's a zaniness about the currency. Bitcoin is built on a weird mix of the most old-fashioned kind of speculative greed, bolstered by a contemporary utopian cyberlibertarian ideology. Boosters say that bitcoin is the currency of the future. I'd argue that the phenomenon is a digital gold rush perfectly emblematic of the present. Some of bitcoin's appeal comes from the fact that it does not physically exist. Each bitcoin is just a string of numbers. Instead of a bank, a decentralized network of computers ensures the authenticity of bitcoin and issues new ones by doing complex calculations. This allows bitcoin to be traded peer to peer, bypassing credit card companies and payment processors. It's digital cash, offering the same relative anonymity and freedom as a paper sack of bills. WikiLeaks began accepting bitcoin donations in 2011 in order to bypass PayPal and credit card companies, which had frozen payments to the organization. The WikiLeaks episode hints at the utopian promise built into bitcoin by its creator, a mysterious programmer called Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity is a subject of dispute and intrigue. The ideas behind bitcoin can be traced to a 1988 tract called the Crypto Anarchist Manifesto, which loftily predicted a future where anonymity-protecting technology made state control of the market impossible. Everything would be for sale to anyone all the time, 100 percent tax-free. Many of bitcoin's hard-core fans see the currency as a revolutionary step toward this anarchocapitalist wonderland. I'm skeptical. I don't think we'll all be paying in bitcoin for tickets to Kanye West's 2024 presidential victory tour. You can't use bitcoin for much today besides gambling in online casinos and reserving seats on Virgin Galactic spaceflights, and a vast majority of it is held by speculators. Even with the imprimatur of government regulation, the promise of bitcoin seems to end with helping online retailers avoid credit-card processing fees. Bitcoin is mainly innovative in the way of credit default swaps: new ways to gamble with money. Bitcoin is most interesting on an emotional level. Its sheen of technomagic has let uber-rational geeks treat the casino-floor frenzy as a serious technological story. Tech blogs breathlessly track the price of bitcoin. Each new business that accepts bitcoin is heralded with the fanfare of a despot opening his country's borders to a new, previously outlawed luxury. The drumbeat suggests that getting rich is as simple as being an early adopter. So many have bought in because the Internet is very good at stoking the fear of missing out. There's even a trendy acronym, FOMO, to describe the anxiety inspired by scrolling through the social media accounts of people having more fun than you. Bitcoin fosters a particularly potent brand of FOMO. Recently there was the story of the Norwegian 20-something who discovered that his long-forgotten bitcoin, bought for basically nothing, was worth so much that he traded some of it to buy an apartment. Bitcoin holders have taken to posting screenshots of their swollen accounts. I know a guy who bought a few hundred dollars' worth of bitcoin as a sort of joke years ago. Now he's made enough to buy a nice car. All I can say is that the crash is going to be great. Bitcoin is too dependent on speculative mania to be of practical use as a currency. But as a symbol of the misguided dream that one can tap into the global data stream and download riches like a pop song, it's gold. "
A Surge in Value for Bitcoin And Currencies Similar to It,"This has been quite the week for the peer-to-peer digital currencies. Exactly seven days ago, Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency, was trading at about $615, but early Wednesday morning it had passed $1,000 on Mt.Gox, the leading Bitcoin exchange, setting a new high. This pushed Bitcoin's market capitalization to over $11 billion.  Not bad for a something that came out of thin air. But the rise of Bitcoin is not happening in a vacuum. It seems the value of almost all cryptocurrencies (and there are several dozen of them) has been growing rapidly over the last week. According to coinmarketcap.com, which monitors cryptocurrencies, Litecoin, a similar but more easily created currency, has risen 60 percent in the last 24 hours alone, bringing its market capitalization to $644 million. Another currency called PeerCoin is up 30 percent since Tuesday, now worth more than $75 million. Namecoin, Feathercoin, Megacoin, Infinitecoin and others are all up double-digit percentage points, too. The rise in pricing is most likely happening concurrently with the rise in attention. There are now more than 1.6 million references to Bitcoin in Google News, which monitors major news outlets around the world. According to Google Trends, which tracks search terms online, references to Bitcoin hit a record this week. And last week Bitcoin took a major step toward the mainstream as federal authorities signaled their willingness to accept it as a legitimate payment alternative. Bitcoin is also growing as it is becoming a more acceptable currency online. A number of Bitcoin investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts have teamed up to create a ''Bitcoin Black Friday,'' where hundreds of retailers and charities, including OkCupid, an online dating service, City Wine Cellar, Reddit and GOOD Magazine, which promotes progress, will accept the currency on Black Friday. These other currencies are all vying to become the next Bitcoin, racing to be seen as a viable online alternative to cash. But not everyone is bullish on these currencies. Edward Hadas, economics editor at Reuters Breakingviews, says he thinks that Bitcoin, and, by proxy, other similar token-based denominations, will fail. ''Bitcoin exemplifies some of the problems of private money: Its value is uncertain, its legal status is unclear, and it could easily become valueless if users lose faith,'' Mr. Hadas wrote. And even if Bitcoin were to succeed, ''governments would either ban it or take over the system.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
China Restricts Banks' Use of Bitcoin,"HONG KONG -- China moved on Thursday to restrict its banks from using Bitcoin as currency, citing concerns about money laundering and a threat to financial stability. The action comes as monetary authorities around the world have begun to confront the issue of Bitcoin, a virtual currency whose value has soared in recent months as interest in it has spread. Part of its rise has been driven by intense demand for the virtual currency in China. The notice curtailing financial institutions' involvement with Bitcoin was issued by the People's Bank of China and four other ministries and agencies, and the directive said the step was needed to ''protect the status of the renminbi as the statutory currency, prevent risks of money laundering and protect financial stability.''  The notice said that Bitcoin was ''not a currency in the real meaning of the word'' but was rather a ''virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency. Nor can, or should, it be circulated or used in the marketplace as a currency.'' Last month, in a sign of Bitcoin's growing acceptance, American regulatory officials told a Senate hearing that financial networks like Bitcoin offered tangible benefits for the financial system. But they warned of the potential for money laundering and other criminal activity associated with such networks. The remarks by United States officials, along with wider acceptance of the virtual currency by merchants, had helped propel the value of the virtual currency beyond $1,100, leaving its total worldwide value at more than $11 billion. It dropped more than $100 on Thursday, according to the Mt.Gox exchange, which handles Bitcoin trading online, to $1,100 from $1,217. Bitcoin was established in 2009 by an anonymous programmer or collective known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Part of the value of the currency is attributable to its limited supply. A maximum of 21 million units can be created, leading investors to bid up the price as demand grows. But with the growing acceptance of the virtual currency has come increasing concerns about its potential use in illicit transactions. In October, the American authorities arrested Ross Ulbricht, the alleged founder of the online marketplace Silk Road, after claiming that the site was being used to buy and sell drugs, weapons and pornography. Bitcoin was the primary form of payment on Silk Road, where people could make purchases anonymously. The Chinese move came after officials in Beijing had expressed some support for the legitimacy of Bitcoin. Yi Gang, the deputy governor of the People's Bank of China and the director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said in November that although the virtual currency might not find favor with China's central bank, people should be free to participate in the Bitcoin market. That sentiment was echoed in the announcement Thursday. ''Ordinary members of the public have the freedom to participate in Bitcoin transactions as a kind of commodity trading activity on the Internet, provided they assume the risks themselves,'' the statement said. In China, Bitcoin was starting to gain favor even among merchants. In the Chaoyang district in Beijing, a restaurant started accepting Bitcoins for payment in defiance of earlier regulation stating that virtual currencies could not be used to purchase real-life goods or services. But in its statement Thursday, the Chinese central bank raised questions about whether Bitcoin could ever gain true legitimacy as legal tender: ''In essence, Bitcoin is a kind of special virtual commodity, and does not have the same legal status as a currency.'' ''Currently, the public lacks sufficient understanding of Bitcoin, and some individuals have been caught up by faddishness or a speculative mentality in holding, using and trading in Bitcoins,'' the statement said. The explanation said that Bitcoins possess ''quite high speculative risks,'' because of the relatively small market and 24-hour trading, with no curbs on market declines. It said: ''The price can be easily controlled by speculators, creating severe turbulence and huge risks. Ordinary investors who blindly follow the crowd can easily suffer major losses.'' "
$25 Million in New Financing for Coinbase,"Updated, 5:55 p.m. | Silicon Valley is ramping up its real money bets on the virtual money Bitcoin. Andreessen Horowitz, a leading venture capital firm, announced on Thursday that it had led a $25 million fund-raising round for Coinbase, a Bitcoin start-up in San Francisco that aims to help virtual currencies gain mainstream acceptance. Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who will join Coinbase's board, said on Thursday that ''it's hard to overstate the excitement of a certain segment of the technology community.''  ''Every day somebody comes in and says, 'Bitcoin is going to be as big as the Internet,' '' Mr. Dixon said. The size of the Coinbase investment dwarfs the previous largest fund-raising effort by a Bitcoin company. Circle Internet Financial, a start-up that processes digital money payments for merchants, raised $9 million in October from investment firms including Accel Partners. While Bitcoin has many naysayers who have called it a speculative bubble and a playing field for frauds, a growing number of mainstream players say it has the potential to be a sort of Internet for money, smoothing the electronic movement of cash. Last week, Bank of America released the first significant research note on digital money, laying out its potential. But the biggest excitement has been among technology insiders like Mr. Dixon. ''We aren't thinking that Amazon is going to be using Bitcoin tomorrow, but I think they will be in five years,'' Mr. Dixon said. ''It's one of the five best computer science ideas of the last 40 years.'' A steady stream of Silicon Valley investors has been building stakes in virtual currency start-ups. Last month, a Chinese Bitcoin exchange raised $5 million from Lightspeed Venture Partners. Google's venture capital arm has put money into a couple of companies in the space, Buttercoin and Ripple Labs. Coinbase has also attracted money from Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital. Bitcoin, created by anonymous programmers in 2009, is a digital currency produced by a network of users competing against one another to solve computer problems, a method known as ''mining.'' The open-source program that created it determined that only 21 million coins would ever be created, leading to a speculative boom that pushed the price of one Bitcoin to more than $1,000 recently from around $200 at the start of November. The growth has led to uncertainty about how regulators will deal with digital money. Chinese authorities last week barred financial institutions in the country from participating in virtual currency transactions. American regulators, on the other hand, have made cautiously supportive statements about the trend. Silicon Valley investors generally hope that Bitcoin will move past the current stage and settle into a more stable period that will allow it to be used as a system for making payments and sending money around the world. Since its founding a little more than a year ago, Coinbase has developed a reputation as one of the most reliable players in the often chaotic world of virtual currencies. The company enables merchants to accept digital money for ordinary purchases and allows customers to trade Bitcoins and hold them in online wallets. Coinbase says it is adding 10,000 online wallets daily and now hosts 600,000 wallets, up from 200,000 just a few months ago. Coinbase said it planned to use the new money to expand its staff and ''promote the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.'' The company added that the world was ''nearing a tipping point for broad adoption of Bitcoin -- what we at Coinbase believe to be one of the most important shifts in the global economy in our lifetime.'' Virtual currencies are accepted at a growing number of merchants. The company Bitpay said this week that it had processed more than $100 million in transactions this year. But this is tiny compared with the number of transactions made by speculators and people buying illicit goods. Mr. Dixon said that Bitcoin had been too complicated for most people who are not technology specialists. But he said that services like Coinbase made it easier to access, opening it to broader use. Some merchants hope that virtual currencies will let them avoid the 2 to 3 percent that they pay on every credit card transaction. In another step in Bitcoin's expansion, the leading nonprofit advocacy group for digital money, the Bitcoin Foundation, said on Thursday that it was opening a London office and creating a program for international affiliates that will include the Bitcoin Association of Australia and the Bitcoin Foundation Canada. The Bitcoin Foundation's primary operations are based in Washington. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Bitcoin, Nationless Currency, Still Feels Governments' Pinch","If Bitcoin is a bubble, as its critics contend, it is showing signs of deflating. A rapid succession of moves by governments around the world has cast doubts on the legitimacy of the virtual currency, and its price fell about 60 percent at one point on Wednesday morning from its high earlier this month. It recovered some as the day went on. The price volatility is underscoring Bitcoin's sensitivity to decisions by government officials despite its promised status as the first global currency free of government intervention and oversight. Money, it turns out, is still a government prerogative.  ''This tight regulation is really counter to what a lot of folks thought was going to happen,'' said Mark T. Williams, a finance professor at Boston University who has been tracking Bitcoin. ''Regulation is the future of e-currency, not decentralization as many had hoped.'' The most damaging news for the digital currency has come out of China, where the largest Bitcoin exchange, BTC China, said on Wednesday that it would no longer accept deposits in renminbi, the Chinese currency. ''For reasons we all know, BTC China has had to cease renminbi-account charging functions,'' the exchange said in a message on its verified account on Weibo, China's Twitter-like messaging service. It said that it would continue operating and that existing deposits and renminbi withdrawals would not be affected. By Wednesday evening, the Shanghai-based BTC was quoting Bitcoins at about 3,200 renminbi, or $530, each. That was a drop of nearly 40 percent from the price on Tuesday and less than half of the peak price of 7,395 renminbi on Dec. 1. The development comes less than two weeks after the Chinese authorities barred mainstream financial institutions from dealing in the virtual currency and a series of moves that followed elsewhere. China had been the fastest-growing part of the Bitcoin world, but it is not the only place where government officials have started to address virtual currency. Over the last week, the European Banking Authority and the authorities in Denmark, Norway, Australia and New Zealand have all raised an alarm about the speculative nature of the new online currencies. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority issued a warning on Tuesday that gave a long list of dangers, including that the ''value of your virtual currencies can change very quickly and can in principle fall to zero.'' The warnings have led to a sharp reversal for Bitcoin after the price of a single coin rose nearly 500 percent in November, fueled by hopes that the currency could serve as a cheaper global payment system. Bitcoins are created and traded according to an open-source program released in 2009. The decentralized network of computers that runs the system is set to release only 21 million Bitcoins, but they are worth only what someone will pay for them. The volatility provides some vindication for critics who have recently been calling Bitcoin a bubble that was sure to pop. Earlier this month, Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, said on Bloomberg Television that it had no ''intrinsic value.'' Professor Williams of Boston University said that Bitcoin had followed the trademark patterns of past asset bubbles, and he predicted that the value would fall to as low as $10 next year. But Bitcoin aficionados are far from accepting that the recent declines spell any sort of long-term trouble for the movement. Users took to Twitter to mount a defense. And the currency has survived swings in value in the past. In April, the value fell 70 percent in a matter of days but eventually recovered fully. Even after the recent declines, the price of Bitcoin is still up 180 percent from where it was in early November. During the day on Wednesday, the price had risen more than 40 percent from its morning low. ''If you look at charts going back for the last few years, this happens all the time,'' said Greg Schvey, the founder of the Genesis Block, a research firm that follows digital money. ''The price is going to fluctuate, but more people know about it, more companies use it and more investment is going into Bitcoin. Bitcoin itself is stronger than it's ever been.'' Some Bitcoin advocates have actually been unhappy with the recent run-up in the price, which has caused many users to hoard their coins rather than spend them. This has led many people to say that Bitcoin cannot rightfully be called a currency. Many of the recent announcements from the European authorities have questioned whether virtual currencies live up to their name. A Norwegian official told Bloomberg News last week that Bitcoin could not be called money and would be treated as an investment asset. But the news out of Europe has not been all negative for the future of digital money. The warning from Denmark this week suggested that consumers would be free to use Bitcoins despite the risks. The United States has taken a similarly cautious but accepting attitude toward virtual currencies. Officials with the Treasury Department have indicated that virtual currency exchanges will be allowed to operate as long as they register as money-transmitting operations. But there are questions about how successful a global decentralized currency can be if people in China, the world's second-largest economy, are shut out. According to Chinese news reports, the People's Bank of China, the central bank, met on Monday with more than 10 of the country's biggest third-party payment processing companies, ordering them to stop all transactions involving digital currencies. Alibaba's Alipay service, the country's biggest processor of online transactions, was among the companies represented at the meeting, according to the reports. On Dec. 5, the central bank and the four agencies jointly banned dealing in Bitcoin, saying the government was acting to ''safeguard the interests and property rights of the public, protect the legal standing of the renminbi, take precautions against the risk of money laundering and maintain financial stability.'' ''Within that region, it's hit a bit of a hurdle that will have to sort itself out,'' Mr. Schvey said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Into the Bitcoin Mines,"On the flat lava plain of Reykjanesbaer, Iceland, near the Arctic Circle, you can find the mines of Bitcoin. To get there, you pass through a fortified gate and enter a featureless yellow building. After checking in with a guard behind bulletproof glass, you face four more security checkpoints, including a so-called man trap that allows passage only after the door behind you has shut. This brings you to the center of the operation, a fluorescent-lit room with more than 100 whirring silver computers, each in a locked cabinet and each cooled by blasts of Arctic air shot up from vents in the floor. These computers are the laborers of the virtual mines where Bitcoins are unearthed. Instead of swinging pickaxes, these custom-built machines, which are running an open-source Bitcoin program, perform complex algorithms 24 hours a day. If they come up with the right answers before competitors around the world do, they win a block of 25 new Bitcoins from the virtual currency's decentralized network. The network is programmed to release 21 million coins eventually. A little more than half are already out in the world, but because the system will release Bitcoins at a progressively slower rate, the work of mining could take more than 100 years.  The scarcity - along with a speculative mania that has grown up around digital money - has made each new Bitcoin worth as much as $1,100 in recent weeks. Bitcoins are invisible money, backed by no government, useful only as a speculative investment or online currency, but creating them commands a surprisingly hefty real-world infrastructure. ""What we have here are money-printing machines,"" said Emmanuel Abiodun, 31, founder of the company that built the Iceland installation, shouting above the din of the computers. ""We cannot risk that anyone will get to them."" Mr. Abiodun is one of a number of entrepreneurs who have rushed, gold-fever style, into large-scale Bitcoin mining operations in just the last few months. All of these people are making enormous bets that Bitcoin will not collapse, as it has threatened to do several times. Just last week, moves by Chinese authorities caused the price of a Bitcoin to drop briefly below $500. If the system did crash, the new computers would be essentially useless because they are custom-built for Bitcoin mining. Miners, though, are among the virtual-currency faithful, believing that Bitcoin will turn into a new, cheaper way of sending money around the world, leaving behind its current status as a largely speculative commodity. Most of the new operations popping up guard their secrecy closely, but Mr. Abiodun agreed to show his installation for the first time. An earnest young Briton, with the casual fashion taste of the tech cognoscenti, he was a computer programmer at HSBC in London when he decided to invest in specialized computers that would carry out constant Bitcoin mining. The computers that do the work eat up so much energy that electricity costs can be the deciding factor in profitability. There are Bitcoin mining installations in Hong Kong and Washington State, among other places, but Mr. Abiodun chose Iceland, where geothermal and hydroelectric energy are plentiful and cheap. And the arctic air is free and piped in to cool the machines, which often overheat when they are pushed to the outer limits of their computing capacity. The operation can baffle even those entrusted with its care. Helgi Helgason, a burly, bald Icelandic man who oversees the data center that houses the machines, said that when he first heard that a Bitcoin mining operation was moving in he expected something very different. ""I thought we'd bring in machines and put bags behind them and the coins would fall into them,"" said Mr. Helgason, with a laugh. Since then, the education he has received about Bitcoins has been enlightening, but only to a point. ""It's a strange business,"" he said, ""and I can't say that I understand it."" Until just a few months ago, most Bitcoin mining was done on the home computers of digital-money fanatics. But as the value of a single Bitcoin skyrocketed over the last few months, the competition for new coins set off a race that quickly turned mining into an industrial enterprise. ""Even if you had hardware earlier this year, that is becoming obsolete,"" said Greg Schvey, a co-founder of Genesis Block, a virtual-currency research firm. ""You are talking about order-of-magnitude jumps."" The work the computers do is akin to guessing at a lottery number. The faster the computers run, the better chance of guessing that right number and winning valuable coins. So mining entrepreneurs are buying chips and computers designed specifically - and only - for this work. The machines in Iceland are worth about $20,000 each on the open market. The energy required to run these computers is huge, and has led to criticism that Bitcoin mining is wasteful, not to mention socially useless. But Mr. Abiodun prides himself on using renewable power, at least in Iceland. When Mr. Abiodun first heard about Bitcoin mining in 2010, he thought it was a scam. Begun in 2009 as the imaginative creation of an anonymous programmer (or group of programmers) known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it was initially little more than a tech world curiosity. As early users connected their computers into the network, they became a part of the decentralized infrastructure that hosts Bitcoin's open-source program. The computers joining the network immediately began capturing virtual coins. The network's protocol was designed to release a new block of Bitcoins every 10 minutes until all 21 million were released, with the blocks getting smaller as time goes on. If the miners in the network take more than 10 minutes to guess the correct code, the Bitcoin program adapts to make the puzzle easier. If they solve the problems in less than 10 minutes, the code becomes harder. Mr. Abiodun's opinion of Bitcoin changed in January, when he saw the price rising. He installed a free application on his home computer that linked him into the Bitcoin network and set it to mining, harnessing the power of his graphics card, which is the part of a normal computer best suited to doing the code work. Mr. Abiodun's computer was in the guest room of his house in southeast London. Working at HSBC during the day and tinkering with his Bitcoin system at night, he realized if he wanted to make any money, his computer would have to run around the clock. The constant computing, however, overheated the graphics card and pushed the computer's exhaust fans into overdrive. When he added another graphics card, then a new computer, the room became too noisy for guests to sleep, and the windows had to be kept open to release the heat. That did not make his wife, Gloria, who was pregnant at the time, very happy. ""It just created a scenario where there was no way our parents would come over to stay,"" he said. ""I did offer to put her parents in a hotel, but that didn't go down well."" Mr. Abiodun's wife finally gave him an ultimatum - either the computers had to go, or he did. At the same time, he was making money, and friends were asking if they could invest in his mining operation. In February, Mr. Abiodun used the investors' money to buy machines from a start-up dedicated solely to manufacturing specialized mining computers. The competition for those computers is so intense that he had to pay for them and wait for delivery. When the delays became lengthy, however, he went on eBay and paid $130,000 for two high-powered machines, which he set up in June in a data center in Kansas City, Kan. This was the beginning of Mr. Abiodun's company, Cloud Hashing, which rents out computing power to people who want to mine without buying computers themselves. The term hashing refers to the repetitive code guessing that miners do. Today, all of the machines dedicated to mining Bitcoin have a computing power about 4,500 times the capacity of the United States government's mightiest supercomputer, the IBM Sequoia, according to calculations done by Michael B. Taylor, a professor at the University of California, San Diego. The computing capacity of the Bitcoin network has grown by around 30,000 percent since the beginning of the year. ""This whole new kind of machine has come into existence in the last 12 months,"" said Professor Taylor, who is studying mining hardware. In the chase for the lucky code that will unlock new Bitcoins, mining computers are also verifying and assigning unique identifying tags to each Bitcoin transaction, acting as accountants for the virtual currency world. ""The network is providing the infrastructure for making sure the currency is being transferred between people according to the rules,"" Professor Taylor said, ""and making sure people aren't creating currency illegally."" Even before Mr. Abiodun's machines in Kansas City were up and running, it was clear that they wouldn't be enough. So he ordered about 100 machines from a start-up in Sweden and, in October, had them moved to the facility in Iceland. In just a few months, that installation has generated more than $4 million worth of Bitcoins, at the current value, according to the company's account on the public Bitcoin network. At the end of each day, the spoils are divided up and sent to Cloud Hashing's customers. Last Wednesday, for example, the entire operation unlocked 225 Bitcoins, valued at around $160,000 at recent prices. Cloud Hashing keeps about 20 percent of the capacity for its own mining. The unregulated Bitcoin-mining industry is ripe for abuse, and ventures that sound similar to Cloud Hashing have turned out to be scams. Mr. Abiodun's company has proved itself real, but it is still unclear if it is a good deal for customers. Cloud Hashing charges $999 to rent a tiny portion of the company's computing power for one year. That's an expensive price for the computing capacity they are getting, but Mr. Abiodun argues that it's a good value because individual miners would not be able to buy his modern machines outright. It's a little like buying a fractional ownership in a private jet; you might not want responsibility for the jet itself, and it's out of your price range anyway. He also says he provides the maintenance and keeps away thieves and hackers. Some Cloud Hashing customers have also complained on Internet forums that it can be hard to get a response from the company when something goes wrong. But this has not stopped new contracts from pouring in. Cloud Hashing now has 4,500 customers, up from 1,000 in September. Mr. Abiodun acknowledges that the company has not been prepared to deal with its rapid growth. He said he had used $4 million raised from two angel investors to add customer service representatives to offices in Austin, Tex., and London. Cloud Hashing is now preparing to open a mining facility in a data center near Dallas, which will hold more than $3 million worth of new machines being produced by CoinTerra, a Texas start-up run by a former Samsung chip designer. The higher energy costs - and required air-conditioning - in Texas are worth it for Mr. Abiodun. He wants his operation to be widely distributed in case of power shortages or regulatory issues in one location. But he is also expanding his Icelandic operation, shipping in about 66 machines that have been running for the last few months near their manufacturer in Ukraine. Mr. Abiodun said that by February, he hopes to have about 15 percent of the entire computing power of the Bitcoin network, significantly more than any other operation. Inside the Iceland data center, which also hosts servers for large companies like BMW and is guarded and maintained by a company called Verne Global, strapping Icelandic men in black outfits were at work recently setting up the racks for the machines coming from Ukraine. Gazing over his creation, Mr. Abiodun had a look that was somewhere between pride and anxiety, and spoke about the virtues of this Icelandic facility where the power has not gone down once. ""We don't want downtime - ever, never,"" he said. ""Not with what we paid. Not with Bitcoin.""  "
Betting on a Coin With No Realm,"This is the story of a $6 million pizza. Two of them, actually. It begins in 2010 -- eons ago, in technology time -- in Jacksonville, Fla. A software programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz had, to his happy surprise, persuaded someone to accept 10,000 Bitcoins in exchange for two pizzas from Papa John's. And why not? By Mr. Hanyecz's reckoning, the Bitcoins he had been ''mining'' on his computer were worth about 0.003 cent apiece. He got his two pies for $30 of found money. You probably know the rest. Bitcoin, the digital currency that has since captured attention around the world, exploded. By November, it had skyrocketed from a fraction of a penny to $1,242, roughly the price of an ounce of gold. It has been a wild, wild ride: up and down, down and up. Last week, Bitcoin fluctuated -- again -- as China clamped down. Everyone seems to be wondering what this crazy new thing might mean. The end of government control over money? The start of an international crypto-currency?  Mr. Hanyecz, 32, seems to be taking it all in stride. And he has no regrets about those pizzas. ''It wasn't like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,'' Mr. Hanyecz told me. ''No one knew it was going to get so big.'' The question now, of course, is whether digital currencies like Bitcoin will get even bigger -- or collapse if the music stops. A quick recap: Bitcoins are created, or mined, according to a set of algorithms. Essentially, computers solve some math problems and -- presto! -- generate Bitcoins. The coins are stored in, and traded among, digital wallets. You can buy real things with them, at least from people who accept them, or, as many people seem to be doing, sit on them in hopes the price will keep rising. So your parents were right: Money doesn't grow on trees. But, it turns out, money does grow on the Internet. Mr. Hanyecz grew his with open-source software. But, per the algorithms, mining Bitcoins becomes more difficult over time. Only about 21 million of them can ever be created -- which is why so many people have been chasing after them. Bitcoins are now accepted as payment at almost a thousand retail outlets and websites, including OKCupid, Reddit, and Pizza Rodi in Montreal. But what has really grabbed attention is how volatile the price has been. The value has gyrated wildly. In the last month alone, the Bitcoin market capitalization has swung between $14 billion and $7 billion. But to Bitcoin believers, that really isn't so surprising. They are taking the long view -- the one in which Bitcoin, despite the ups and down, keeps appreciating in value and eventually becomes a serious currency. ''People talk about the volatility with surprise, but it's exactly what you'd expect from a new global asset class whose regulatory landscape is still developing,'' Tyler Winklevoss told me. He and his twin brother, Cameron -- famous for their involvement in Facebook -- have invested heavily in Bitcoin. By some estimates, they own 1 percent of the market. ''We have never sold a single Bitcoin -- we started buying in the high single digits and we're in it for the long haul,'' Mr. Winklevoss said. ''We don't look at it in terms of day-to-day. We look at in terms of years.'' The Winklevosses are hardly the only ones who are bullish on Bitcoin. Bank of America recently put out a report saying Bitcoin has clear potential for growth and ''may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers.'' Jed McCaleb, creator of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange, a sort of Nasdaq for Bitcoin, says there is a possibility the price could hit $30,000 in a few years. Mr. McCaleb sold the exchange to a Japanese Bitcoin firm in 2011. Mark Williams of Boston University has insisted that the value of a Bitcoin will pop, falling as low $10 next year. Others say it is all just another bubble. Which is why this whole will-it-go-up, will-it-go-down business misses the point. The real question is not what Bitcoin will be worth next week or next month. It is whether digital currencies like this have promise and, if so, how they could change our world. Digital currencies -- whether Bitcoin or something else -- could make it cheaper and easier to move money around. ''While there are questions about the future of Bitcoin, there is clearly going to be a digital currency that can be used for remittances, micro payments, and across borders,'' said Susan Athey, a professor of economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. ''In today's system you see a number of different kinds of commerce not taking place because the fees are too high relative to the transactions.'' With small transactions, the cost to send money can be more expensive than the actual money people are spending. People are charged credit card fees, transfer fees and other expenses that all go to a middle man. This is why there are no 10 cent apps on the app store, many companies try to clump small transactions together online. With virtual currencies, in comparison, there is no middle man. With Bitcoin, for example, anyone running the software on his or her computer also acts as the bank storing the exchange information. Ms. Athey said that while it was unclear if Bitcoin or a competing math-based currency -- and hundreds of other virtual currencies are in the market now -- would prevail, it was clear that there was a need for this type of tender online. ''Something that has less frictions could enable certain types of commerce to occur that aren't occurring today,'' she said. And figuring out which digital currency will catch on could make you very rich. Mr. Hanyecz, for his part, has given up mining. With so many people trying to create Bitcoins, and the entire process becoming more difficult, the cost of running mining computers, in terms of the electricity bill alone, has soared. Any regrets about those pizzas? ''No, not really,'' Mr. Hanyecz said. He sold the rest of his Bitcoins as the price approached $1, netting him about $4,000. ''That was enough to get a new computer and a couple of new video cards,'' he told me, proudly. ''So I'd say I ended up on top.''

Bits And Barbarism,"This is a tale of three money pits. It's also a tale of monetary regress -- of the strange determination of many people to turn the clock back on centuries of progress. The first money pit is an actual pit -- the Porgera open-pit gold mine in Papua New Guinea, one of the world's top producers. The mine has a terrible reputation for both human rights abuses (rapes, beatings and killings by security personnel) and environmental damage (vast quantities of potentially toxic tailings dumped into a nearby river). But gold prices, while down from their recent peak, are still three times what they were a decade ago, so dig they must. The second money pit is a lot stranger: the Bitcoin mine in Reykjanesbaer, Iceland. Bitcoin is a digital currency that has value because ... well, it's hard to say exactly why, but for the time being at least people are willing to buy it because they believe other people will be willing to buy it. It is, by design, a kind of virtual gold. And like gold, it can be mined: you can create new bitcoins, but only by solving very complex mathematical problems that require both a lot of computing power and a lot of electricity to run the computers.  Hence the location in Iceland, which has cheap electricity from hydropower and an abundance of cold air to cool those furiously churning machines. Even so, a lot of real resources are being used to create virtual objects with no clear use. The third money pit is hypothetical. Back in 1936 the economist John Maynard Keynes argued that increased government spending was needed to restore full employment. But then, as now, there was strong political resistance to any such proposal. So Keynes whimsically suggested an alternative: have the government bury bottles full of cash in disused coal mines, and let the private sector spend its own money to dig the cash back up. It would be better, he agreed, to have the government build roads, ports and other useful things -- but even perfectly useless spending would give the economy a much-needed boost. Clever stuff -- but Keynes wasn't finished. He went on to point out that the real-life activity of gold mining was a lot like his thought experiment. Gold miners were, after all, going to great lengths to dig cash out of the ground, even though unlimited amounts of cash could be created at essentially no cost with the printing press. And no sooner was gold dug up than much of it was buried again, in places like the gold vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where hundreds of thousands of gold bars sit, doing nothing in particular. Keynes would, I think, have been sardonically amused to learn how little has changed in the past three generations. Public spending to fight unemployment is still anathema; miners are still spoiling the landscape to add to idle hoards of gold. (Keynes dubbed the gold standard a ''barbarous relic.'') Bitcoin just adds to the joke. Gold, after all, has at least some real uses, e.g., to fill cavities; but now we're burning up resources to create ''virtual gold'' that consists of nothing but strings of digits. I suspect, however, that Adam Smith would have been dismayed. Smith is often treated as a conservative patron saint, and he did indeed make the original case for free markets. It's less often mentioned, however, that he also argued strongly for bank regulation -- and that he offered a classic paean to the virtues of paper currency. Money, he understood, was a way to facilitate commerce, not a source of national prosperity -- and paper money, he argued, allowed commerce to proceed without tying up much of a nation's wealth in a ''dead stock'' of silver and gold. So why are we tearing up the highlands of Papua New Guinea to add to our dead stock of gold and, even more bizarrely, running powerful computers 24/7 to add to a dead stock of digits? Talk to gold bugs and they'll tell you that paper money comes from governments, which can't be trusted not to debase their currencies. The odd thing, however, is that for all the talk of currency debasement, such debasement is getting very hard to find. It's not just that after years of dire warnings about runaway inflation, inflation in advanced countries is clearly too low, not too high. Even if you take a global perspective, episodes of really high inflation have become rare. Still, hyperinflation hype springs eternal. Bitcoin seems to derive its appeal from more or less the same sources, plus the added sense that it's high-tech and algorithmic, so it must be the wave of the future. But don't let the fancy trappings fool you: What's really happening is a determined march to the days when money meant stuff you could jingle in your purse. In tropics and tundra alike, we are for some reason digging our way back to the 17th century. "
"Overstock.com, Signaling Mainstream Support, Plans to Accept Bitcoin","One of the biggest questions looming over Bitcoin, the digital currency generating attention in the tech business, is when big mainstream merchants will begin accepting it. Overstock.com, the online discount retailer, has an answer: within the next six months, if all goes as planned.  Patrick Byrne, the company's chief executive, said Overstock planned to let online shoppers pay for goods with Bitcoin by June. The retailer is evaluating the services of several third-party firms that facilitate Bitcoin transactions, with the goal of selecting one by mid-January. If Overstock follows through on the plan, it will become the most prominent retailer to embrace Bitcoin, an electronic currency that initially gained notoriety as a form of payment for black market drug and weapons transactions and as a new craze for currency speculators. Bitcoin has captivated the imaginations of many technology entrepreneurs and investors, who it as a low-cost payment system that could disrupt established players like Visa and MasterCard. But while many of them are forming or funding start-ups to provide different types of Bitcoin services, not many well-known retailers accept it directly. Mr. Byrne's decision to take Bitcoin as a form of payment is driven by philosophical reasons more than business ones. In a lengthy voice mail message explaining his plans, Mr. Byrne said ''some fraction, tiny now, of the population'' currently wanted to transact using a digital currency like Bitcoin. He appears more intrigued, however, by the idea of supporting a digital currency that is outside the control of any traditional government authority, echoing a libertarian argument that many fans of Bitcoin have made. Mr. Byrne finds the limitations of creating Bitcoins appealing -- there is a finite number of Bitcoins that can be made available and they are released at predetermined pace, unlike traditional government currency. ''You want money to be based on something that no government mandarin can wish into existence with the stroke of a pen,'' he said. In October, Mr. Byrne said that Overstock was thinking about accepting Bitcoin, but that it had suspended its plans because of the regulatory uncertainty around the digital currency. While regulators are still grappling with the implications of digital currency, several federal officials said at a Senate hearing in November that they believed digital currencies could operate within existing laws. Mr. Byrne is a colorful executive who has been known to stake out controversial positions, including against investors he believes manipulated his company's stock. He also has an unconventional résumé. Once an aspiring professional boxer, Mr. Byrne has a black belt in taekwondo and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Stanford. One obstacle to mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin may be its wildly fluctuating value, which could scare off consumers. After the value of a single Bitcoin surged to $1,137 in late November, the price has fallen to about $759, deflated largely by a crackdown by Chinese authorities on Bitcoin trading. Mr. Byrne said Overstock would insulate itself from such fluctuations by using derivatives to hedge the risk from any Bitcoins it holds. Alternately, the retailer may simply convert its Bitcoins to dollars on a nightly basis, he said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Letters,"Two Sides of Bitcoin Mining ''Into the Bitcoin Mines'' (Dec. 22) took a look inside a high-security complex in Iceland where powerful computers, churning 24 hours a day, aim to find the mathematical keys to creating Bitcoins, the much-debated virtual currency. On nytimes.com, readers joined the conversation, offering their views on Bitcoins' value -- and future prospects. The following comments have been edited and condensed.  This is indeed a strange phenomenon, incomprehensible to those of us who were taught -- early in our lives -- that money represents the taxing power of the issuing sovereign governments. It represents the power of those governments to lay claim to the present and future assets within that nation in payment of public debt. Pieces of that debt therefore become accepted as a medium of exchange. That is true whether the symbol of that power is printed on pieces of shiny metal, paper bank notes or recorded as numbers in bank deposits. How can such numbers be accepted as a medium of exchange when they represent the taxing power of no sovereign government? What then do they represent? Until that is explained clearly, some of us will continue to regard Bitcoins as fool's gold, that represents nothing. DONALD SURR, PENNSYLVANIA Before Bitcoin and its peers become currencies, they will first become useful in commerce as methods of payment. And, given the current fees to use credit cards and to send money around the world, there are incentives for merchants, start-ups and consumers to embrace and use Bitcoins. For this reason these tools are unstoppable. Their use as a method of payment will stabilize prices, after which they will become useful as a currency -- a store of value for even the most conservative penny-pincher. In less than 10 years, a majority of people will use digital currencies in some way or another. G, NYC This craze in cybertulips will certainly make some very rich, but in general, this much computing power has only a very real effect: to waste energy and release greenhouse gases galore as these computers churn away. There is certainly going to be a virtual coin in the future, but no political power will allow it to be unregulated. YOANDEL, BOSTON Since when is ''money'' only what a government ordains? Most of human history has ''money'' of intrinsic value that is divorced from government ordainment. Bitcoin is such --whether you believe it is perfect or not. It contains all the elements that an individual wants and needs -- with the value settled upon by the individual. CANUCANOE1, NEW YORK Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com "
Adam Smith Hates Bitcoin,"There have been many good pieces written on the dubious economics of Bitcoin; I especially liked this one by Neil Irwin. One thing I haven't seen emphasized, however, is the extent to which the whole concept of having to ""mine"" Bitcoins by expending real resources amounts to a drastic retrogression - a retrogression that Adam Smith would have scorned.  Smith actually wrote eloquently about the fundamental foolishness of relying on gold and silver currency, which - as he pointed out - serve only a symbolic function, yet absorbed real resources in their production, and why it would be smart to replace them with paper currency: The gold and silver money which circulates in any country, and by means of which, the produce of its land and labour is annually circulated and distributed to the proper consumers, is, in the same manner as the ready money of the dealer, all dead stock. It is a very valuable part of the capital of the country, which produces nothing to the country. The judicious operations of banking, by substituting paper in the room of a great part of this gold and silver, enable the country to convert a great part of this dead stock into active and productive stock; into stock which produces something to the country. The gold and silver money which circulates in any country may very properly be compared to a highway, which, while it circulates and carries to market all the grass and corn of the country, produces itself not a single pile of either. The judicious operations of banking, by providing, if I may be allowed so violent a metaphor, a sort of waggon-way through the air, enable the country to convert, as it were, a great part of its highways into good pastures, and corn fields, and thereby to increase, very considerably, the annual produce of its land and labour.  And now here we are in a world of high information technology - and people think it's smart, nay cutting-edge, to create a sort of virtual currency whose creation requires wasting real resources in a way Adam Smith considered foolish and outmoded in 1776.

Daily Report: Digital Money Is Gaining Champions in the Real World,"Silicon Valley and Wall Street are taking note of bitcoin, which has drawn prominent investors like the Winklevoss twins, Nathaniel Popper and Peter Lattman report on Friday in The New York Times.  The twins, Cameron and Tyler - Olympic rowers, nemeses of Mark Zuckerberg - are the first prominent figures in the largely anonymous bitcoin world to publicly disclose a big stake. They say they own nearly $11 million worth. Or at least $11 million as of Thursday morning, when trading was temporarily suspended after the latest and largest flash crash left a single bitcoin worth about $120 and the whole market worth $1.3 billion. At one point, the price had plummeted 60 percent. To skeptics, the frenzy over the bitcoin network, which was created by anonymous programmers in 2009, looks more like the mania for Dutch tulip bulbs in the 1600s than the beginnings of an actual currency. ""To say highly speculative would be the understatement of the century,"" said Steve Hanke, a professor specializing in alternative currencies at Johns Hopkins University. Whatever else it is, bitcoin has become the financial phenomenon of the moment. In addition to the Winklevoss twins, Silicon Valley investment firms, while not holding bitcoins, are starting to show interest in the technology. On Thursday, a group of venture capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz, announced that it was financing a bitcoin-related company, OpenCoin. The Winklevosses say this week's tumult is just growing pains for a digital currency that they believe will become a sort of gold for the technorati. ""People say it's a Ponzi scheme, it's a bubble,"" said Cameron Winklevoss. ""People really don't want to take it seriously. At some point that narrative will shift to 'virtual currencies are here to stay.' We're in the early days."" While little is known about the creator of bitcoin, or whether it even was a single person, the work involved serious programming chops, building a system that could live on borrowed computer space around the world. It was determined that only a finite number of bitcoins could be created - the count is currently around 11 million. New coins are ""mined"" by programmers who solve mathematical riddles and can sell their coins on upstart exchanges. For now, there are few places where bitcoins can be used. One marketplace is an online bazaar, Silk Road, where narcotics are reportedly the main wares for sale. But bitcoin believers imagine a future where the e-cash can be used at their local Starbucks. The Winklevosses have paid in bitcoin for the services of a Ukrainian computer programmer who has worked on their Web site.  "
A Push for a Bitcoin Buttonwood,"Amid the incense, cheap art and herbal remedies for sale in Union Square in Manhattan on Monday, a very different kind of product was changing hands: bitcoins. Just feet from the park's statue of George Washington, a crowd of young men gathered on Monday afternoon to buy and sell the digital, crypto-currency. The men - and there were only men - were brought together by an online posting from Josh Rossi, 31, a bitcoin aficionado who works in technology at the World Trade Financial Group.  One of the trademarks of bitcoins since they were created by anonymous programmers in 2009 has been that they have no physical form, and can be exchanged completely electronically, making human interactions unnecessary. But the online venues for buying and selling bitcoins have become too expensive and time consuming, Mr. Rossi said. So he proposed what he called Project Buttonwood, a reference to the where the New York Stock Exchange had its beginning in 1792. ""If I want to buy a hamburger, I want to be able to sell my bitcoins and get my money immediately so I can buy that hamburger,"" said Mr. Rossi, who wore jeans and loafers for the occasion, and smoked a cigarette while watching the proceedings. The legality of bitcoin has been questioned by some regulators, and investors have looked on in horror in recent weeks as the price of a single bitcoin has bounced around more sharply than the most speculative stock. Mr. Rossi's posting about the event on Reddit was sniped at by one commentator who said ""you might get busted by the Feds"" and another who predicted ""the first bitcoin 'gang' fight."" In the end, such dire predictions did not pan out. After a slow start at 4 p.m., just as trading on the New York Stock Exchange shut down for the day, the crowd grew to about 20 people. There were a few polite arguments about how the process should work, and then people began calling out prices at which they were willing to buy and sell bitcoins. Many of the young men alternated between conversation and watching the nearby skateboarders and break dancers. The first transaction came when Mr. Rossi pulled out a $20 bill in order to buy a part of a bitcoin, at a rate of $120 for a single bitcoin. The seller was Owen Gundon, a 30-year old programmer.  In order to transfer the online currency, Mr. Rossi used his smartphone to take a picture of thegraphic code on Mr. Gundon's phone, which provided access to his bitcoin account. The crowd around the men clapped. ""This is markets becoming more efficient,"" Mr. Rossi said with a smile. Nearby, Kirill Gourov, a 21-year old college student, said he was looking to buy a bitcoin for $125 and was serving as a broker for a friend who was text messaging him, and who wanted to sell his bitcoin for $112. The gap between the bid and offer in Union Square was significantly larger than it was at the same time on the biggest online exchange, Mt. Gox, where the going price was around $114. But before long, a few more buyers and sellers met. Gabe Sukenik, the 24-year old founder of a bitcoin start-up, Coinapult, pulled out a wad of $20 bills and counted out enough cash to buy two bitcoins from a young man who identified himself as a Wall Street trader. ""I'll flip a coin for a hundred bucks if you want,"" said the trader. ""That's my risk tolerance."" As the afternoon went on, a man who gave his name as Jerry, took out a notebook and began recording the trickle of trades. He jokingly said he would serve as the exchange's clerk if someone bought him a Coke. ""We're here enjoying the sunshine, enjoying the ladies, and trying to move the bitcoin community along,"" Jerry said. Mr. Rossi said he planned to be back in the same place next Monday.  "
An E.T.F. Too Far,"Exchange-traded funds are taking over the financial world. At last official count, there were nearly 1,200 of them at the end of 2012, compared with about 100 a decade ago, according to the Investment Company Institute trade group. With a new issue now linking to the virtual currency Bitcoin, the $1.3 trillion index tracker industry seems to cover nearly everything. And yet the most important asset class of all has been ignored.  Breakingviews stands ready to remedy the situation.  The first E.T.F.'s were created to track the performance of broad market indices. Two decades on, there are E.T.F.'s that offer exposure to Mongolia, combating global warming and even, in a way, garbage. There are E.T.F.'s that invest in other E.T.F.'s. And if the Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame get their way, it will soon be possible to trade shares that track the value of bitcoins. Putting aside the question of whether a bitcoin E.T.F. shouldn't really be priced in bitcoins, this addition to already breathtaking diversity makes it all the more surprising that no such fund caters to the growing group of extremely risk-averse investors. Tapering talk means more of them want to wait out the storm by rotating back into cash. Here, the E.T.F. whizzes have let them down. The Breakingviews Dollar Trust should calm their nerves. This Hades-on-Winter-registered security will hold United States dollars in a segregated custody account and issue shares that aim to reflect the performance of the underlying asset - minus expenses, of course. Its sponsor is Greenback Reserve Electronic Exchange Distribution, which controls the proprietary technology needed to manage the assets. As a defensive investment, this trust is unlikely to suffer from the market dislocation that has recently afflicted more speculative E.T.F.'s. And by holding what is arguably the world's most liquid asset, it avoids the liquidity mismatch regulators fear is a feature of some of the funds. The Breakingviews Dollar Trust will quite literally be as safe as keeping cash in the bank. Owning it will now be as easy as buying and selling a stock - and for only a fraction of the typical management fee.  Peter Thal Larsen is Asia editor at Reuters Breakingviews.

Bringing Bitcoin to the Mainstream,"Two backers of the alternative crypto-currency bitcoin, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins best known for their part in the history of Facebook, are trying to bring bitcoin to a broader investing public, pending approval of the United States government, Nathaniel Popper and Peter Lattman report in DealBook. The brothers filed a proposal with securities regulators on Monday that would allow any investor to trade bitcoins through an exchange-traded fund. ""It is part of a broader effort to remove the stigma hovering over bitcoin and other online money endeavors, which have faced a barrage of regulatory questions and enforcement actions,"" DealBook writes. The proposal is an audacious one, and it is far from certain that securities regulators will approve it. For background, DealBook has a primer on bitcoin. The filing set off lively commentary on social media. ""The Winklevoss Bitcoin filing must be some sort of peak market absurdity indicator? Perhaps it means there is no value anymore?"" Izabella Kaminska of FT Alphaville wrote on Twitter. ""Well, at least the Winkelvii Bitcoin trust is consistent with their practice of being parasitic on new innovation,"" Epicurean Dealmaker, a pseudonymous Twitter user, wrote. ""'Bitcoin ETF' is an anagram of 'Fiction Bet' which seems pretty apt,"" Lorcan Roche Kelly, chief Europe strategist at Trend Macrolytics, said in a post.  LOAN PRACTICES OF CHINA'S BANKS RAISE CONCERN  |  Some of China's largest banks have been sending text messages to the phones of many of the country's wealthy, trying to raise cash to finance lending outside the scrutiny of bank regulators, David Barboza reports in The New York Times. ""The complex way they go about making off-the-balance-sheet loans is at the heart of China's $6 trillion shadow banking industry, which the government is now trying to tame. Efforts to rein in the dodgy lending practices rattled stock markets worldwide in late June."" ""China's regulators - and a fair number of economists, policy makers and investors - worry that legitimate banks are using lightly regulated wealth management products to repackage old loans and prop up risky companies and projects that might not otherwise be able to borrow money,"" Mr. Barboza writes. ""Analysts warn that shadow banking is helping drive the rapid growth of credit in a weakening economy, which could lead to - in the worst situation - a series of bank failures."" Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse, said of shadow banking: ""This is the biggest uncertainty I've seen in my 18 years following the China market."" SORKIN'S SUMMER READS  |  Some of the best business books are so dramatically written they could easily be beach reading. Others provide a grounding in economic and business history. And still others are practical books that help explain the thinking in the corner office. With summer here, Andrew Ross Sorkin has compiled a list (though not an exhaustive one) of some of his favorite business books. They include ""Den of Thieves"" by James B. Stewart, ""Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco"" by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, ""The Informant"" by Kurt Eichenwald, ""Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World"" by Liaquat Ahamed, ""The Art of War"" by Sun Tzu and the classic, ""The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing"" by Benjamin Graham. ON THE AGENDA  |  Data on factory orders in May is out at 10 a.m. Constellation Brands reports earnings before the market opens. Sheila C. Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is on Bloomberg TV at 7:48 a.m. A SLOW HALF FOR DEALS  |  ""A long-awaited rebound in mergers is taking its time to arrive. But for all the hand-wringing by bankers and lawyers, the business of arranging deals has not quite disappeared yet,"" DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes. The first half of 2013 was the slowest first six months for mergers in four years, with about $996.8 billion worth of deals announced in the period, down 13 percent from the period a year earlier, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The number of deals announced worldwide in the first half was 16,808, the fewest for the period since 2003. ""We're seeing buyers and sellers talk about deals, only to see them die in the marketplace,"" said Scott A. Barshay, the head of the corporate department at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. In Europe, the deal environment remained gloomy. The number of announced European deals fell 43 percent, to $221 billion, in the first six months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters, DealBook's Mark Scott reports. That has left investment bankers scratching their heads over how to get deals done. ""At the U.S. Open, the best players in the world couldn't break par. It's the same for our industry,"" Hernan Cristerna, the new global co-head of JPMorgan Chase's mergers and acquisitions division. "
Daily Report: Bitcoin and Other Virtual Currencies Face Legal Scrutiny,"State and federal officials are starting broad investigations into shortcomings in the oversight of upstart virtual currencies like bitcoin, Nathaniel Popper reports. The Senate's committee on homeland security sent a letter this week to financial regulators and law enforcement agencies asking about the ""threats and risks related to virtual currency."" These currencies, whose popularity has grown in recent years, are often used in online transactions that are not monitored by traditional financial institutions.  ""This is something that is clearly not going away, and it demands a whole government response,"" said a person involved in a Senate committee's investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry is continuing. The Senate letter went out the same day that New York's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, sent subpoenas to 22 companies that have had some involvement with bitcoin, according to a person briefed on the investigation. Previously, there have been isolated efforts to crack down on those who took advantage of virtual currencies. But the two investigations made public this week appear to be the most wide-ranging government efforts to exert more coordinated control over what has been a largely faceless and borderless phenomenon. Bitcoin, the most well-known digital currency, was started by anonymous Japanese computer programmers in 2009 and was intended to serve as an alternative to national currencies. Only a limited number of bitcoins can be created. And an online community has bid up the price of individual bitcoins, which are stored digitally on a decentralized network of computers. On Tuesday, a bitcoin was being sold for about $108 online.  "
Facing a Flood of Junk Text Messages in China,"Fake receipts. Dubious massages. Short-term loans. English lessons from actual foreigners. On an average day the average Chinese person will receive a text message advertising such services and many others. Some are merely unwanted promotions. Others, like the messages from one's ""landlord"" that list a new bank account you should send your money to, are outright frauds. The texts plague cellphones and have in turn helped drive the growth of mobile messaging apps such as Tencent's WeChat.  In the first half of this year, Chinese mobile phone users received more than 200 billion such junk messages, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency, citing a new report. The report was compiled by the Internet search firm Sogou and published on a website recently established in Beijing to guard against online rumors. The website, set up this year by six major Internet portals under the direction of the state-run Beijing Internet Information Office, has prompted concern that it would be used to restrict online speech. Efforts to curtail junk text messages, however, would have wide public support. China has nearly 1.2 billion mobile subscribers, and by official estimates each mobile phone number receives an average of one junk text a day. The report said that 1.5 percent of the messages were outright scams, and losses were estimated at 30 million renminbi, or about $4.9 million. One quarter of the messages originated in the southeastern province of Guangdong, and the biggest targets were the major cities of Beijing and Shanghai. Most of the texts come from numbers with the 106 prefix set up by Chinese telecoms specifically to issue text messages. Last month CCTV, the state-run broadcaster, ran a long segment criticizing China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom for their role in facilitating the flood of junk texts in order to profit from fees paid by advertisers. The three main mobile service providers said they were stepping up their efforts to block junk texts. Given the companies' commercial interests in sending out texts, curbing the problem requires stronger government oversight, analysts say.  "
Mapping Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, the popular Internet currency, is on the map in more ways than one.  You can watch it trading across the globe, and possibly draw some intriguing conclusions about where this fast-moving digital money is going. For the last week, a site called fiatleak has offered a map that its creator says draws information from all the major online bitcoin exchanges, like Mt. Gox and BTC-e, and shows what country's residents are buying bitcoins, in real time.   There are also sites that listall major bitcoin exchanges, but they don't show it as a global phenomenon as vividly. One striking thing about the map: Bitcoin is increasingly a Chinese craze. Even at the height of the American and European trading days, when it's 3 a.m. in China, Chinese transactions far outstrip activity in euros. The United States dollar transactions are still more popular than Chinese at that time, with about twice as many transactions. China was barely involved in bitcoin a year ago, however. The Chinese presence can also strengthen when it is daytime in China and night in the United States. ""You can watch China and the U.S. play Ping-Pong on this,"" said Andrew Hodel, who built the site. ""You see the psychology, as the bitcoin goes over a threshold number in dollars or yuan.""  Other players, like people in Japan or Britain, barely figure into the exchanges. Russians do not apparently trade much, but that participation is masked by their activities in the euro-based market. The map also shows the value of bitcoin in the local currency, based on the most recent trade. By Monday evening, the value of a bitcoin unit soared past $700 on some exchanges. The total outstanding pool of bitcoin - which is created by a network of users who solve complex mathematical problems - is now worth more than $7 billion. Mr. Hodel is an American living in Uruguay who owns a small Internet service provider called Cobianet, operating in Texas and Colorado. He says he owns only about 10 bitcoins, but admits a fascination with the currency.  ""It opened my eye to the fact that the U.S. isn't as influential as I thought,"" he said. ""Bitcoin is a currency, a commodity and an accountancy built by developers that is completely decentralized. It's fundamentally better.""  As to whether the huge influx of Chinese buyers could signal a bubble, Mr. Hodel said it proved the opposite. ""Speculation from yuan buyers is running wild,"" he said, ""but bubbles are cultural reactions to a development. This is happening over all kinds of cultures."" Of course, that also raises the prospect that bitcoin is the first bubble currency of our new global digital culture. ""That could be too,"" Mr. Hodel said. ""But that probably means it will bubble up, burst, and come back,"" the way several currencies have in the past when they initially rise to pre-eminence.  Nathaniel Popper contributed reporting.

Bitcoin Gets a Cautious Nod From China's Central Bank,"This week, the Chinese government issued its most direct statement to date on the legitimacy of Bitcoin, the thus-far-unregulated digital currency that has taken China, the United States and other countries by storm in recent months.  Speaking at an economic forum on Wednesday, Yi Gang, the deputy governor of the People's Bank of China and director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said that it would be impossible for China's central bank to recognize the Bitcoin as a legitimate financial instrument in the near future. But, Mr. Yi added, people are free to participate in the Bitcoin market and he would personally adopt a long-term perspective on the currency. The statement comes during a week of remarkable turbulence on China's numerous Bitcoin exchanges. On BTC China, the world's largest exchange platform for the digital currency, the value of a Bitcoin more than doubled from about 3,000 renminbi, or about $500, on Sunday to nearly 7,000 renminbi on Tuesday. By midday on Wednesday it was back below 4,000 renminbi and on Friday it was hovering around 5,000 renminbi. Such volatility in large part reflects uncertainty over how the Chinese government - as well as other governments - may decide to regulate the currency. As a result, even minor policy or media signals have triggered wild fluctuations in the currency's value. Analysts suspect that the currency's sharp rise on Tuesday came in response to the United States Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke's letter to the United States Congress, in which he wrote that financial innovations like Bitcoin ""may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system."" Favorable media coverage on CCTV, China's state-run broadcaster, has also pushed up the currency's value. A segment that aired on Oct. 28 about the world's first Bitcoin ATM, in Vancouver, precipitated a rise on China's Bitcoin exchanges. Although Mr. Yi's remarks were the most direct government statement to date, his words are far from conclusive. He stopped short of calling Bitcoin illegal and he explicitly stated that ordinary Chinese citizens retain the freedom to trade in Bitcoins, given its status as a form of online trading. At the same time, China has historically maintained very strict control over its currency, the renminbi, and some experts speculate that the government could still outlaw or restrict Bitcoin if it grows too large or proves socially or financially destabilizing. According to industry analysts, the government already has the legal grounds to crack down on Bitcoin, if it chooses. In 2009, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Culture jointly issued rules prohibiting both the use of virtual currency to purchase actual goods and services and the exchange of virtual currency for renminbi.

Malone Aims to Shake Up Cable TV,"John C. Malone, whose success wiring American homes for cable television in the 1980s and 1990s earned him the nickname King of Cable, is back on the prowl in the industry he helped create, DealBook's David Gelles reports. Mr. Malone, 72, now the chairman of Liberty Media, is working behind the scenes to gain control of Time Warner Cable, the country's second-largest cable operator by subscribers, behind Comcast. Such a deal would thrust him back into the heart of the cable TV world at a precarious time for the business, with overall pay television subscribers declining and content costs soaring. But Mr. Malone is energized by the prospect of returning to the fray. ""John looks out and says, 'That's an industry that I helped shape, that made me a lot of money, but more importantly that I care a lot about, and I want to see that industry set right,'"" Gregory B. Maffei, Liberty Media's chief executive, said in a recent interview. Mr. Maffei, 53, who is leading Liberty Media's day-to-day efforts to strike a deal, said that Mr. Malone believed the cable industry is once again primed for transformation. ""We have expressed a view that consolidation is helpful,"" Mr. Maffei said, adding, ""Time Warner Cable is appealing.""  BEYOND BITCOIN  | ""With mounting interest from prominent investors and growing acceptance from regulators, bitcoin - either the new gold or the next Dutch tulip craze, depending on who is being asked - is at the center of the virtual money universe.

""In the alternative galaxy of virtual currencies, newly created money can become worth millions of real dollars in a few months. All the PeerCoin in existence, for example, was worth nearly $40 million last week. Programmers and mathematicians release new entrants into the field almost every week. On one popular exchange, Cryptsy, 60 different coins can now be traded. Almost all of these altcoins, as they are known, have fed on the stratospheric rise of bitcoin.""

""We should all be concerned that there doesn't seem to be a natural end point to how high fines could go,"" Mr. Cutler said at an industry conference on Friday, according to Fortune. ""One hundred million dollars is still meaningful."" And yet, Gretchen Morgenson writes in the Fair Game column in The New York Times, the settlement raises a big question: What took so long? Much of the statement of facts accompanying the deal ""was the same-old-same-old, a not-very-lively description of a corrupted Wall Street mortgage factory, based largely on some facts that have been in the public domain for years.""

Daily Report: Virtual Currencies Seek to Challenge Bitcoin,"With mounting interest from prominent investors and growing acceptance from regulators, bitcoin - either the new gold or the next Dutch tulip craze, depending on who is being asked - is at the center of the virtual money universe. Yet there are dozens of digital alternatives, like PeerCoin, Litecoin and anoncoin, whose backers point to advantages they say their currencies have over bitcoin, Nathaniel Popper reports.  PeerCoin, according to Lawrence Blankenship, a software engineer from Springfield, Mo., is closer than bitcoin to the perfect, communal money. Mr. Blankenship, who is 34, has arranged to accept PeerCoin as the virtual currency of choice at a Star Trek convention he is organizing in his hometown. ""Looking down the road 10 years from now, I definitely see bitcoin being ousted,"" he said. ""Everyone's going to start switching to other coins, and hopefully PeerCoin comes out ahead in that."" In the alternative galaxy of virtual currencies, newly created money can become worth millions of real dollars in a few months.

Activist Funds and Board Influence,"""As activist hedge funds continue to get more of their preferred candidates on the boards of companies, some of the hedge funds are angling for certain directors to be paid twice: once by the company, and once by the hedge funds that supported their candidacy,"" DealBook's David Gelles reports. ""In two efforts earlier this year, dissident candidates up for election at the Hess Corporation and the Canadian fertilizer company Agrium - two companies targeted by activists - were offered large bonuses by the hedge funds that nominated them. At Hess, Elliott Management nominated five candidates to the oil company's 14-member board, saying current management had underperformed. And at Agrium, Jana Partners nominated five directors to a 12-person board. In both cases, the directors nominated by the hedge funds would have received their bonuses only if the companies' stock rose sharply. ""None of the activist directors joined the boards with such arrangements in place. The dissident slate at Agrium was rejected, and while some new directors joined the board at Hess, they did so without the extra compensation. Nonetheless, the prospect of such incentives upset the stuffy world of corporate governance. And the simmering dispute around director compensation from third parties is the latest front in the growing war of influence being waged between activist hedge funds and corporate boards.""  THE PARIS HILTON OF CURRENCY  | ""How can bitcoin be anything but a passing fad?

A Prediction: Bitcoin Is Doomed to Fail,"The developers of bitcoin are trying to show that money can be successfully privatized. They will fail, because money that is not issued by governments is always doomed to failure. Money is inevitably a tool of the state. Bitcoin relies on thoroughly contemporary technology. It consists of computer-generated tokens, with sophisticated algorithms guaranteeing the anonymity, transparency and integrity of transactions. But the monetary philosophy behind this web-based phenomenon can be traced back to one of the oldest theories of money. Economists have long declared that currencies are essentially a tool to increase the efficiency of barter, which they consider the foundation of all organized economic activity. In this view, money is a convenient instrument used by individuals to get things done. It is not inherently part of the apparatus of government.  I think of the concept of privately issued tender as ""right money,"" because the whole idea appeals instinctively to right-wing thinkers. They dislike centralized authority of all sorts, including monetary authority. For example, Friedrich Hayek, Margaret Thatcher's favorite economist, proposed replacing the state's monopoly on legal tender with competing currencies offered by rival banks. Mr. Hayek presumably would have approved of bitcoin. The currency's issuer is an unknown computer programmer, about as far from a government as can be imagined. Right now bitcoin is tiny; at the current exaggerated exchange rate, the total projected volume of ""coins"" is worth less than the gross domestic product of Mongolia. Still, Mr. Hayek might well have dreamed of bitcoins becoming a global currency for wages, prices and loans. He would, though, have hoped for a more stable value, not the increase from $13 to $900 per bitcoin in less than a year. But the right-money historical narrative is simply wrong, as the anthropologist David Graeber explains in his book ""Debt, The First 5,000 Years."" Straightforward barter played a tiny role in all premodern economies. Instead, what we nowadays think of as purely economic activity was inseparable from an intricate structure of social relationships and spiritual beliefs. Purely commercial activity was rare - and it almost always relied on some form of government-issued money. Barter was not the precursor to money: it has always been the inferior alternative. So it is not surprising that barter economies only develop when governments break down. Similarly, truly private money is an inferior alternative to the money that comes with the backing of a political authority. After all, no bank or bitcoin-emitter can be as public-minded as a government, and no private power can raise taxes or pass laws to unwind monetary excesses. In short, while the freedom promised by right money may be ideologically appealing, monetary relations are too closely interwoven with other economic, political and social relations to be managed well by any institution with less sway than a government. The detailed work of money creation can be delegated to independent central banks and to a credit system of regulated private banks, but the ultimate authority of any functioning monetary system will always be the ultimate political authority. Bitcoin exemplifies some of the problems of private money. Its value is uncertain, its legal status is unclear and it could easily become valueless if users lose faith. Besides, if bitcoin ever really started to take off, governments would either ban it or take over the system. The authorities might be motivated by a genuine concern about the stability of a shadow monetary system or they might act out of self-preservation. Tax evasion would be too easy in a right-money parallel economy. Mr. Hayek thought left-wing thinkers ignored the dangers of big government. He may have been right, but his idealism cannot overturn reality. All effective money is state-backed - what could be called ""left money."" Of course, the global monetary system has suffered from appalling management in recent years. The authorities, especially in the United States, first allowed banks to act almost as if they were in a right-money world, lending and speculating wildly. That led to a typical right-money disaster - a sudden loss of trust and the failure of leading institutions. The authorities rescued the financial system, but their monetary system still cannot provide steady support to the rest of the economy. The outcome could have been much worse. Banks are still in business and consumer inflation rates are generally low. Still, the typical current combination of low interest rates, large government deficits and high ratios of debt to G.D.P. amounts to an invitation to monetary accidents. Part of the interest in virtual currencies like bitcoin is that their anonymity can provide a convenient cloak for criminal activity. Part is technological - this is a cool idea. And part is speculative - gamblers bet that bitcoin's value will increase. But I suspect another important factor is political: Bitcoin appeals because governments are not fully living up to the responsibility that comes with state-sponsored money. Bitcoin, or something like it, will thrive until the authorities do better. Edward Hadas is economics editor at Reuters Breakingviews.

"For Bitcoin, a Setback in China and an Endorsement on Wall Street","China has thrown some cold water on Bitcoin, the popular virtual currency that has gained many adherents in the country. The Chinese government on Thursday moved to restrict banks from using Bitcoin in transactions, declaring that it was not a true currency at all, The New York Times reports. A notice issued by the People's Bank of China and four other ministries and agencies said the step was needed to ""protect the status of the renminbi as the statutory currency, prevent risks of money laundering and protect financial stability."" The price of Bitcoin, which has surged in recent months and is characterized by bouts of volatility, dropped on the news. After reaching a high of $1,240, the price fell to around $1,085 on Thursday, at one point touching a low of $870, according to the Mt.Gox exchange.  The notice in China said Bitcoin was ""not a currency in the real meaning of the word"" but rather a ""virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency. Nor can, or should, it be circulated or used in the marketplace as a currency."" At the same time, China said that investors were free to speculate on Bitcoin at their own risk. ""Ordinary members of the public have the freedom to participate in Bitcoin transactions as a kind of commodity trading activity on the Internet, provided they assume the risks themselves,"" the statement said. The announcement had outsize significance for Bitcoin fans because China has quickly become one of the hottest markets for the virtual currency. Chinese transactions in Bitcoin far outstripped activity in euros in November, even at the height of the American and European trading days, according to an analysis bya site called Fiatleak. A year ago, China was barely involved in Bitcoin at all. This map helps illustrate the craze.  The venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners was even betting that Beijing would endorse Bitcoin, noted The Financial Times's Alphaville blog. Bitcoin fever was particularly intense in the city of Wenzhou. But while hopes of a Chinese seal of approval have been dashed, Bitcoin is gaining some institutional respect in the United States. In a move that appears to be unique among Wall Street firms, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has begun to cover Bitcoin, saying in a research report on Thursday that it could be useful in e-commerce and money transfers. ""We believe Bitcoin can become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers,"" said the report by Bank of America currency strategists led by David Woo. ""As a medium of exchange, Bitcoin has clear potential for growth, in our view."" The report, which offered a primer on Bitcoin and described how it is ""mined,"" said that a ""fair value analysis"" of the currency suggested a maximum value of $1,300. At the same time, however, Bitcoin has ""considerable shortcomings which we believe will ultimately hinder it from ascending to international currency status,"" the report said. ""Bitcoin's role as a store of value can compromise its viability as a medium of exchange. Its high volatility, a result of speculative activities, is hindering its general acceptance as a means of payments for online commerce,"" according to the report. The Bank of America report comes on the heels of positive comments by United States government officials. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress last month that currencies like Bitcoin ""may hold long-term promise,"" helping send the price higher. Still, some monetary policy experts are skeptical. Unlike conventional currencies, Bitcoin is not backed by a central bank or government. Nout Wellink, the former president of the Dutch Central Bank, recently told students at the University of Amsterdam that the Bitcoin craze was reminiscent of the mania over tulips that hit Amsterdam in the early 17th century, according to The Guardian. Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, was blunt in his assessment.  ""It's a bubble,"" he told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. ""It has to have intrinsic value. You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is. I haven't been able to do it. Maybe somebody else can.""  "
Shaking the Bitcoin Believers,"So much for China's willingness to tolerate financial innovation. Regulators have barred the country's banks from trading bitcoin, while denying the pseudo-money legal status and cracking down on anonymous users. Though China has stopped short of an outright ban, the move dashes hopes the country might allow start-up currencies to exist alongside the official renminbi.  China's crackdown is by far the most decisive by the world's financial regulators to date. That's probably because enthusiasm for bitcoin appears to have been greater there than in any other single country. Data from online exchanges suggests that China has in recent weeks accounted for around a third of global trading volume. For a while, Chinese bitcoin buyers were also paying a significantly higher price for their virtual stash than users outside the Middle Kingdom. Though China has not made bitcoin illegal, the directive from the People's Bank of China severely limits its potential uses. It is a ""virtual good"" without legal status. Financial institutions are banned from trading it - a significant step in a country where banks will accept copper and rubber as collateral for loans. Moreover, the PBOC has taken steps to limit the anonymity that makes bitcoin appealing as a means of exchange in illicit deals - or as a way around China's capital controls. The regulatory assault undermines the narrative that bitcoin is in the vanguard of a global shift toward new, computer-generated forms of money. With that new monetary age paradigm looking shaky, the virtual asset has lost a good portion of its speculative appeal. The price of bitcoin on BTC China, the country's leading exchange, fell by about 20 percent following the ruling. Devotees will still insist that government restrictions cannot undermine an asset which was devised as an alternative to state-controlled fiat currencies. It also remains to be seen whether other countries will adopt the same hard line. Nevertheless, bitcoin's true believers are having their faith tested.

Bitcoin Fever: Using Digital Currency to Understand the Nature of Money," Overview | What are bitcoins, and why are people buying them?  What makes currency valuable?   In this lesson, students explore the fundamental characteristics of currency by reading and researching about the bitcoin, the experimental and upstart digital commodity that has grabbed the attention of speculators, investors, bankers and regulators around the world.    Materials | Computers with Internet access  Warm-Up | Ask students to watch the above video about the bitcoin asking the question: What makes money - money? Then have students discuss the video, and their understanding of how money works. If you have additional time, students can work in small groups to invent a new currency.  Groups should consider: What would your currency look like? How would they acquire it? What would they use it for? And how might it gain, or lose, value? Then groups can share before the class reads the related article.     Related | In his Op-Ed article ""Much Ado About Bitcoin,"" Adrian Chen, a journalist who helped bring the bitcoin mainstream attention, describes the basic premises of the digital currency: Bitcoin is built on a weird mix of the most old-fashioned kind of speculative greed, bolstered by a contemporary utopian cyberlibertarian ideology. Boosters say that the bitcoin is the currency of the future. I'd argue that the phenomenon is a digital gold rush perfectly emblematic of the present. Some of the bitcoin's appeal comes from the fact that it does not physically exist. Each bitcoin is just a string of numbers. Instead of a bank, a decentralized network of computers ensures the authenticity of the bitcoin and issues new ones by doing complex calculations. This allows the bitcoin to be traded peer to peer, bypassing credit card companies and payment processors. It's digital cash, offering the same relative anonymity and freedom as a paper sack of bills.  Background Vocabulary | Read the entire article with your class, then answer the questions below.   Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:   Activity | Have students explore the fundamental characteristics of currency by reading and researching about the bitcoin.  Begin with this short history of the bitcoin so that students can familiarize themselves with the currency's origins and emergence into mainstream use.  Then have groups of students choose some of the following aspects of the bitcoin to research and present on.  1. How is the bitcoin being used as a currency, and by whom?  One function of currency is to facilitate the exchange of goods and services.  In order for that to occur, people must be willing to accept the currency for those goods and services.  So, who accepts the bitcoin as payment?  Rides on Virgin Galactic's commercial spaceflights and black market deals may not be for everyone, but here's someone who bought all their Christmas gifts with the bitcoin. And who is buying the bitcoin?  Read this article about how the bitcoin is catching on with speculators in China, and see a real-time map of how bitcoins are circulating around there world.  2. What value does the bitcoin have, and where does it get its value?  Bitcoin's F.A.Q. page explains why the currency has value:  Bitcoins have value because they are useful as a form of money. Bitcoin has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies). In short, the bitcoin is backed by mathematics. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to hold value is trust and adoption. Yet a currency has limited value unless it is officially recognized by nations and institutions.  Who recognizes the bitcoin as a legitimate payment method?  Read about what federal officials in the United States think about the bitcoin.  And while China's Central Bank initially signaled approval for the digital currency, recent developments suggest they may have changed their mind. Ideally, the value of a currency should be stable and predictable.  So, how much is a bitcoin worth?  You can track the value of a bitcoin in United States dollars or in other world currencies.    3. How are Bitcoins created, and how are they kept secure?  Most currencies have the property that new money can simply be printed, but where do the new bitcoins come from?  They are ""mined,"" which has become a competitive business opportunity for participants.  Paul Krugman describes this process of mining as ""a drastic retrogression"" that is as fundamentally foolish as relying on gold and silver was a century ago. When someone ""mines"" a new bitcoin, what is its value?  Use the  current value of a bitcoin or the total value of all the bitcoins in circulation to find out. Although the new bitcoins can be ""mined,"" the maximum number of bitcoins that can ever be issued is 21 million and the rate at which new bitcoins are issued automatically slows over time.   Another important feature of currency is that its security is guaranteed.  Who guarantees the security of the bitcoin?  Who watches over all of the transactions?  Read up on how the bitcoin works, and how security in the system is managed. Then read about recent episodes of fraud involving the bitcoin, and the limits of current regulations to crack down on digital currency theft.  Going Further   Will the bitcoin succeed as a currency?  Neil Irwin writes in The Washington Post that the bitcoin is useful for teaching a lesson about why money has value, but that it won't work as an important alternative monetary system. The Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman agrees that the bitcoin's reliance on a fixed money supply may possibly make it a good investment, but not a healthy currency.  It leads to speculating and hoarding, which damages its usefulness as a currency. Read the above articles about these potential fundamental flaws in the bitcoin's design, and decide whether you think the bitcoin will succeed?      What other digital currencies are on the market?  Bitcoin isn't the only digital currency on the market.  Read about the competition among currencies in this DealBook article, and check out the values of various virtual currencies.  Do you think a different digital currency design, one that doesn't rely on a fixed money supply, might ultimately be more successful than the bitcoin in the long term? Or, is it the finite supply of bitcoins that actually makes the currency so appealing to investors?  Standards  This resource may be used to address the academic standards listed below.

Bitcoin Believers See a Role for Wall Street,"A venture capitalist, a former regulator, a lawyer and a pair of entrepreneurs - Bitcoin evangelists all - gathered on Tuesday in the private dining room of an upscale Manhattan restaurant to discuss their vision of a world in which the currency plays a role in mainstream finance. It may be a far-fetched notion - Bitcoin, despite the attention it has received in recent months, is still largely a plaything for speculators online, with stomach-turning price swings - but it is one that these men have bet millions of dollars can be achieved.  ""The rising value of Bitcoin is a put option, or a bet, that Bitcoin gets adopted as a medium of exchange,"" said Jeremy Allaire, the founder of Circle Internet Financial, a start-up in Boston that seeks to be a payment-processing system for Bitcoin. Mr. Allaire, who sponsored the gathering, said he had a modest position in Bitcoin, which he did not disclose. ""Wall Street will find a way"" to get involved in Bitcoin, said Barry Silbert, the founder of SecondMarket, which created a Bitcoin fund that has $62.9 million in net assets under management as of Tuesday afternoon. ""It doesn't take a lot of money to move the needle in the Bitcoin world.""  ""We're in inning one of a nine-inning game,"" said Chris Daniel, a lawyer at Paul Hastings who represents Circle Internet Financial. The event, held at A Voce in Time Warner Center, showcased the arguments that some of Bitcoin's most influential advocates are using to promote the currency's adoption. They insisted that Bitcoin, a digital asset without backing from any central bank or government, could one day become widely used in money transfers and payments large and small. A prominent venture capitalist, Jim Breyer, has given his vote of confidence to that proposal, participating in a $9 million investment in Mr. Allaire's company. Mr. Breyer mingled with others at the restaurant on Tuesday before the dinner began. The Bitcoin advocates emphasized that the process of ""mining"" Bitcoin - essentially, using powerful computers to solve complex equations - contributes to the infrastructure of the decentralized currency. But they held out hope that Wall Street firms would get involved, lending Bitcoin a measure of stability. Raj Date, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who recently joined the board of Circle, offered a hypothetical case to illustrate the currency's promise. Suppose he was trying to call his parents in Turkey, he said. He could do that free over the Internet. But to send them $100? That would cost him. Not if he used Bitcoin, however. There are several serious obstacles in the way of this vision, including Bitcoin's extreme volatility. But this could be ironed out if big financial firms entered the market, Mr. Date said. ""The path to lower volatility, absent significant market makers, is possible theoretically; I don't think it's ever happened,"" he said. Mr. Silbert, the entrepreneur behind the Bitcoin fund, said another large player was getting involved in a Bitcoin venture. ""There's a very large fund family that's launching one soon that's not yet public,"" he said. Last week, on the same day that the Chinese government threw cold water on Bitcoin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch became the first main Wall Street firm to release research about the currency. The report said that a ""fair value analysis"" of Bitcoin suggested a maximum value of $1,300. Currently, the price of one Bitcoin is about $928, according to the Mt. Gox exchange. That report ""woefully undervalued"" Bitcoin, Mr. Allaire said. ""He positioned himself for lots of Bitcoin upgrades over the next six months,"" Mr. Silbert said. The Bitcoin supporters played down the significance of the decision by China, which moved to restrict banks from using Bitcoin in transactions. They pointed to a Senate hearing last month at which federal officials spoke optimistically about the benefits of digital money - a hearing at which Mr. Allaire testified. Another obstacle for Bitcoin believers is the problem of fraud. Bitcoin transactions lack transparency and can be used to facilitate money laundering, Peter J. Henning wrote in DealBook's White Collar Watch column. Mr. Daniel, the lawyer in the room, said that such fears were behind the times. ""If you called me in January of this year, I would have told you that, through back channels, we were hearing that there was a real propriety issue with Bitcoin,"" he said. But he said that governments are less focused now on shutting down Bitcoin operators than on ""encouraging innovation."" For Mr. Silbert, defending Bitcoin has become a regular occupation. ""I'm invited to do these dinners almost nightly,"" he said. "
Venture Capital Bets Big on Bitcoin,"Silicon Valley's bets on the digital currency Bitcoin keep getting bigger. A San Francisco company, Coinbase, announced on Thursday that it had raised $25 million from some prominent venture capitalists in the largest ever fund-raising round for a Bitcoin company.  Since its founding a little over a year ago, Coinbase has developed a reputation as one of the most reliable players in the often chaotic world of virtual currencies. The company enables merchants to accept digital money for ordinary purchases, and allows customers to trade Bitcoins and hold them in online wallets. Coinbase hosts 600,000 online wallets, up from 200,000 in August. The investors behind Coinbase include some of the biggest names in venture capital, like Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz , which is investing in Coinbase for the first time in the current series B round. Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz , is joining the Coinbase board. He used the announcement to extol the possibilities of Bitcoin. ""The designers of the web built placeholders for a system that moved money, but never successfully completed it,"" Mr Dixon said. ""Bitcoin is the first plausible proposal for an economic protocol for the internet."" Coinbase said it planned to use the money to expand its staff and ""promote the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin."" The company added that the world was ""nearing a tipping point for broad adoption of Bitcoin - what we at Coinbase believe to be one of the most important shifts in the global economy in our lifetime."" Bitcoin, created by anonymous programmers in 2009, is a digital currency produced by a network of users who solve complex mathematical problems - a method known as ""mining."" The open-source program that created it determined that only 21 million coins would ever be created, leading to a speculative boom that has pushed the price of single Bitcoin to more than $1,00 recently from around $200 at the beginning of November. Fraud has accompanied this surge in price, but the Bitcoin concept has been viewed as a potentially revolutionary way to move money around the world.  "
Bitcoin Mania Heads Into the Endgame,"Common sense is catching up with the Bitcoin craze. In the process, it is bringing its backers financial losses and intellectual embarrassment. As far as price is concerned, Bitcoin is behaving as it has for the past two years: with intense volatility. The dollar price of a Bitcoin rose from $5 at the beginning of 2012 to $1,200 in early December. As of Wednesday afternoon Beijing time, it was trading just above $500, having fallen by about a quarter during the day.  The catalyst for the latest collapse was news from a leading Chinese Bitcoin exchange that the Beijng government had banned new purchases with yuan. Bitcoin enthusiasts may say that the authorities are acting because they feared the growth of a currency that is free of the power of an oppressive state. Hardly. They saw a smuggler's paradise - a means of exchange for illegal deals and a tool for dodging capital controls. Lurking behind the recent falls are fundamental intellectual flaws. Bitcoin's technological wizardry promises scarcity, which is a prerequisite for the existence of value. But demand is also important. There are similarities between Bitcoiners and gold bugs: distrust of government being one. Unlike bullion, however, the community-run computer program is neither beautiful nor truly useful. The startling price volatility, meanwhile, undermines the belief that Bitcoin can serve as a medium of exchange. Users normally need assurance that currencies will hold their value - over short periods at least. Speculation, not fundamental value, explains why Bitcoin nearly quadrupled in value in November. Buyers simply wanted to get in while the going was good. Now the Bitcoin story is turning sour, owners are trying to capture some of their gains, or cut their losses. Compared with the peak, Bitcoin's price is down more than 50 percent. The fall reinforces the message from Beijing: There is no good reason to own Bitcoins. The electronic pseudo-currency has had a good run. Ideologues, speculators and scammers enjoyed the fun while it lasted. But now that the authorities are taking notice, the price has much further to fall. Edward Hadas is economics editor at Reuters Breakingviews.

Bitcoin Is Evil,"It's always important, and always hard, to distinguish positive economics - how things work - from normative economics - how things should be. Indeed, on many of the macro issues I've written about it has been obvious that large numbers of economists can't bring themselves to make that distinction; they dislike activist government on political grounds, and this leads them to make really bad arguments about why fiscal stimulus can't work and monetary stimulus will be disastrous. I don't, by the way, think that this effect is symmetric: although people like Robert Lucas were quick to accuse people like Christy Romer of fabricating macro arguments to support a big-government agenda, this didn't actually happen. But I come now to talk not about macro but about money - specifically, about Bitcoin and all that.  So far almost all of the Bitcoin discussion has been positive economics - can this actually work? And I have to say that I'm still deeply unconvinced. To be successful, money must be both a medium of exchange and a reasonably stable store of value. And it remains completely unclear why BitCoin should be a stable store of value. Brad DeLong puts it clearly: Underpinning the value of gold is that if all else fails you can use it to make pretty things. Underpinning the value of the dollar is a combination of (a) the fact that you can use them to pay your taxes to the U.S. government, and (b) that the Federal Reserve is a potential dollar sink and has promised to buy them back and extinguish them if their real value starts to sink at (much) more than 2%/year (yes, I know). Placing a ceiling on the value of gold is mining technology, and the prospect that if its price gets out of whack for long on the upside a great deal more of it will be created. Placing a ceiling on the value of the dollar is the Federal Reserve's role as actual dollar source, and its commitment not to allow deflation to happen. Placing a ceiling on the value of bitcoins is computer technology and the form of the hash function... until the limit of 21 million bitcoins is reached. Placing a floor on the value of bitcoins is... what, exactly? I have had and am continuing to have a dialogue with smart technologists who are very high on BitCoin - but when I try to get them to explain to me why BitCoin is a reliable store of value, they always seem to come back with explanations about how it's a terrific medium of exchange. Even if I buy this (which I don't, entirely), it doesn't solve my problem. And I haven't been able to get my correspondents to recognize that these are different questions. But as I said, this is a positive discussion. What about the normative economics? Well, you should read Charlie Stross: BitCoin looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mind-to damage states ability to collect tax and monitor their citizens financial transactions. Go read the whole thing. Stross doesn't like that agenda, and neither do I; but I am trying not to let that tilt my positive analysis of BitCoin one way or the other. One suspects, however, that many BitCoin enthusiasts are, in fact, enthusiastic because, as Stross says, ""it pushes the same buttons as their gold fetish."" So let's talk both about whether BitCoin is a bubble and whether it's a good thing - in part to make sure that we don't confuse these questions with each other. "
An Ubernerd Weighs In,"My old college roommate John R. Levine, who was a techie before anyone knew such creatures existed (let alone that they would rule the world), sends me a note about Bitcoin that confirms some of my own suspicions:  It occurs to me that part of the disconnect is that Bitcoin solved a major technical problem, one that people had been thinking about for about 20 years, and we nerds just can't believe that it doesn't also solve an economic problem.  The technical problem is double spending-if I have some digital money, it's easy enough to verify cryptographically that it's real, but if I give it to you, how can you tell that I haven't also given it to someone else?  Until Bitcoin, the answer was to have a bank that knew which coins were valid, so you'd present my coin to the bank, which would check its database and if it's valid, cancel it and give you a newone.  Bitcoin has its decentralized blockchain which is a very clever recasting of the problem so that the state of the ""bank"" is whatever the majority of bitcoin miners agree that it is.  Getting enough of the miners to agree is known as the Byzantine Generals problem, and has a technical history of its own. So with this breakthrough, we must have an economic breakthrough?  We don't?  Well, then you just don't understand/are in the pocket of the illuminati/whatever.  If you belive that Bitcoin is a lot like paying for stuff with little bags of gold dust where every grain of dust has a publicly recorded serial number, well, then, uh. My current guess is that the Bitcoin bubble will collapse when there is some bad news, e.g., a regulator demands registration of Bitcoin wallets, people try and cash out, and find that that while it's easy to buy bitcoins, it's much harder to find people willing to buy back nontrivial amounts, very hard to collect the sales proceeds, and completely impossible without revealing exactly who you are. "
Cynical Fantasies,"One thing that happens when you try to have a rational discussion of Bitcoin, gold, and/or other libertarian causes is that you get a lot of cynical remarks about government (which is one of the clues that this is, to an important extent, about politics.) You say that there's nothing putting a floor under Bitcoin's value? Well, how do you know that the government won't debase the dollar to nothing? Huh? Huh?  Well, there's an answer to that: governments care about their reputations, and even, to some extent, about the welfare of their citizens. I can hear the jeering already. We know better, don't we? Don't governments with the power of the printing press universally abuse that power? Well, no. That sounds like cynical realism, but it's actually cynical fantasy. Yes, Weimar. Also Zimbabwe. And, in recent decades, who else? Actually, nobody. The real track record of fiat currencies is that most of them are run responsibly except in the aftermath of political chaos. If you look at the actual facts, you discover that episodes of high inflation have become quite rare, even though nobody is on the gold standard or (except in the euro area) anything like it. So, again, the notion that governments can't be trusted with the printing press sounds cynical and realistic, but it's actually a fantasy, probably brought on by reading Ayn Rand instead of Tolkien. It's similar, by the way, to another cynical and supposedly realist notion, which is that fiscal stimulus never goes away, that programs instituted to fight a slump inevitably become permanent. This is also totally untrue - it's a right-wing fantasy, not a description of anything that has actually happened. Now, it's true that governments aren't run by philosopher-kings; news at 8. But the popularity of the notion that they're inevitably or even usually run by looters and moochers says more about what some people want to believe than about the lessons of history. "
"Chinese Activist's Computer Did Not Have Spyware, N.Y.U. Says","Chen Guangcheng, the blind legal advocate who made headlines last year after escaping house arrest in China, can apparently rest assured: The Apple smartphone and tablet he was given upon his arrival in New York by Christian activists do not contain spyware. That assessment, conveyed Monday in what was described as a joint statement by New York University and the Christian advocacy group China Aid, should put to rest one of the more bizarre episodes associated with Mr. Chen's rocky first year in the United States, which culminated last spring with accusations that school administrators had ended his fellowship under pressure from the Chinese government. University officials vehemently denied the allegations, saying the arrangement was always meant to last one year, and Mr. Chen and his allies never provided evidence backing up their assertions.  Last June, in the midst of that ugly maelstrom, N.Y.U. lodged a stunning claim: that the Texas-based Christian group had given Mr. Chen and his family, fresh off the plane from China, an iPhone and iPad loaded with software that could track their movements and online activity. At the time, Jerome A. Cohen, the N.Y.U. law professor who helped secure Mr. Chen's fellowship, described the software as a ""Trojan horse,"" citing school technicians who had examined the devices. Bob Fu, the president of China Aid who was instrumental in publicizing Mr. Chen's claims against the school, called Mr. Cohen's charges ""crazy"" and vowed that he and his organization would be vindicated. Mr. Chen never publicly weighed in on the controversy. According to their joint statement, N.Y.U. agreed to retract the spyware accusations, chalking up the entire incident to a good faith ""misunderstanding of technology."" The statement, which was distributed by China Aid, did not elaborate on the misunderstanding, and neither Mr. Fu nor Mr. Cohen would comment, citing the terms of their agreement.It is unclear how far the statement will go toward easing the deep enmity between the two sides. In recent months, Mr. Cohen and other legal scholars have stood by their contention that Mr. Fu and conservative figures manipulated and misled Mr. Chen by taking advantage of his lack of English and his unfamiliarity with the partisan nuances of American politics. For his part, Mr. Fu has refused to back down from claims that N.Y.U., in an effort to appease Chinese officials and ease the opening of a new campus in Shanghai, prematurely ended Mr. Chen's stay. The contentious falling out had a direct impact on Mr. Chen's prospects: Shortly after the incendiary accusations, funding was rescinded for a visiting scholar position at Fordham University law school in New York. In October, Mr. Chen accepted a three-year fellowship with a conservative think tank in New Jersey that will allow him to maintain affiliations with Catholic University of America and the Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice. He did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. The joint statement released on Tuesday did attempt to smooth over some of the hurt feelings. It included a roundabout apology from Mr. Cohen and N.Y.U. regretting ""media reports may have had any negative impact on Bob Fu, his wife Heidi Cai, or China Aid."" And Mr. Fu also paid tribute to Mr. Cohen, considered a leader in the field of Chinese legal reform, for his contributions to the cause of human rights. It then ended with something of a joint cheer: ""All of the parties reaffirm their common support for the human rights of the Chinese people.""  "
U.S. Government Issues Warning About Security on Android Phones,"Google's Android operating system is the most widely used mobile software system in the world, which makes it a big target for makers of malicious software, the way Microsoft Windows system is. Now the American government has issued a warning about the potential security threat of Android.  In a document recently made public, though issued last month, the Department of Homeland Security warned police officers, firefighters, emergency medical services and security personnel about the security issues in Android. It said earlier versions of Android, released in 2011, had several security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions of the software. The report says Android accounts for 79 percent of mobile malware, while Apple's iOS accounts for 0.7 percent. ""The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date,"" said the unclassified report, which was recently published by Public Intelligence. The document lays out some of the common security threats in earlier versions of Android, including a vulnerability in text messaging, where malicious software can steal money by making secret charges to a user's phone bill - a method called toll fraud. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  "
Facebook Says Technical Flaw Exposed 6 Million Users,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook has inadvertently exposed six million users' phone numbers and e-mail addresses to unauthorized viewers over the last year, the company said late Friday.  Facebook blamed the data leaks, which began in 2012, on a technical flaw in its huge archive of contact information collected from its 1.1 billion users worldwide. As a result of the problem, Facebook users who downloaded contact data for their list of friends obtained additional information that they were not supposed to have. Facebook's security team was alerted to the problem last week and fixed it within 24 hours. But Facebook did not publicly acknowledge the flaw until Friday afternoon, when it published a message on its blog explaining the situation. A Facebook spokesman said the delay was because of a company procedure stipulating that regulators and affected users be notified before making a public announcement. ''We currently have no evidence that this bug has been exploited maliciously, and we have not received complaints from users or seen anomalous behavior on the tool or site to suggest wrongdoing,'' Facebook said on its blog. While the privacy breach was limited, ''It's still something we're upset and embarrassed by, and we'll work doubly hard to make sure nothing like this happens again,'' it added. The breach follows recent disclosures that several consumer Internet companies, including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Yahoo, turned over troves of user data to a large-scale electronic surveillance program run by American intelligence officials. The companies, led by Facebook, successfully negotiated with the United States government last week to reveal the approximate number of user information requests that each company had received, including secret national security orders. "
Americans Cover Their Web Tracks,"Most Americans say they believe the law is inadequate in protecting their privacy online. The e-mail or social media accounts of one in five have been broken into. And most American consumers take great efforts to mask their identities online. These findings are part of a survey by the Pew Internet Center that was released Thursday. They come amid a cascade of widely publicized revelations about the depth of United States government surveillance on the electronic communications of its citizens. And they challenge the conventional wisdom advanced in support of both commercial tracking and official monitoring of Web services: ''If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear.''  Apparently, most Americans do have something to hide -- at least from complete strangers trying to profit from knowing what they do online. The Pew survey found that 86 percent of Americans were trying to scrub their digital footprints by doing a variety of things, like clearing browsing histories, deleting certain social media posts, using virtual networks to conceal their Internet Protocol addresses, and even, for a few, using encryption tools. ''Our team's biggest surprise was discovering that many Internet users have tried to conceal their identity or their communications from others,'' noted Sara Kiesler, an author of the report and a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ''It's not just a small coterie of hackers. Almost everyone has taken some action to avoid surveillance.'' The findings come at a time when many lawmakers have reacted with outrage about government surveillance but done very little to curb private tracking of Americans Web browsing. Google and Facebook, among other popular services, profit almost entirely on the behaviorally targeted advertising. What we write in our e-mails, what we browse online and what we buy, both online and offline, are compiled and analyzed, all in the service of showing us what the digital advertising industry calls ''relevant'' advertising. Efforts to develop global standards for Do Not Track browser settings have been stalled. Anyway, as consumers move to smartphones, companies and advertisers have devised new ways of tracking them. The legislature in California recently approved a measure to require Web sites to tell users whether they honor Do Not Track signals on browser settings. The bill does not prohibit tracking, but requires all Web services to spell out what they do when faced with a Do Not Track signal, which some browsers turn it on automatically. It is now pending the California governor's signature. The Pew survey was carried out on the phone with 792 adult Americans in July. It contained a margin of error of 3.8 percentage points. In the survey, 55 percent said they were worried about the breadth of personal information that exists about them online, considerably higher than the 33 percent who admitted to being worried in 2009. Public concern seemed also to stem from apprehension about the law. Two-thirds of those surveyed said they believed the nation's laws were ''not good enough in protecting their privacy online.'' Users experimented with a variety of strategies to mask themselves. About half said they posted material using their real names, or aliases commonly associated with them. But one in four surveyed said they ''posted material without revealing who they are.'' Young people were more likely than others to switch back and forth, suggesting what previous studies have suggested: that digital natives, as the generation who grew up with the Internet are called, heavily curate their online identities. The sometimes painful consequence of disclosure was also reflected. Just over 20 percent said an intruder had broken into their e-mail or social networking account; 12 percent said they had been ''stalked or harassed;'' and 10 percent had lost sensitive information to online thieves, including bank account information. These findings are echoed by a poll also issued Thursday by TRUSTe, a San Francisco company that vets the privacy policies of Web sites and mobile apps and gives a seal of approval to those that meet its criteria. It found that nearly four out of five smartphone users in the United States were reluctant to download apps they did not trust. More than two-thirds of mobile users did not like being tracked for the purposes of behavioral advertising. And even as about half of all smartphone users said they were willing to share some personal information in exchange for shopping discounts, most were loathe to reveal their exact location or their Web browsing activity. The TrustE survey was conducted online with over 700 Internet users in the United States in June. In March, before a former National Security Agency contractor began to leak details about the agency's surveillance apparatus, a survey by Forrester Research picked up on a trend of heightened privacy concerns among consumers about online tracking for behavioral advertising. Commissioned by Neustar, an Internet service provider company, Forrester's survey found that 27 percent of Americans were using an ad blocking tool when they browse the Web; 18 percent had turned on a ''Do Not Track'' setting in their browsers. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"U.S. Prism, Meet China's Golden Shield","BEIJING - On Tuesday, shortly before China escalated its criticism of the United States over its global surveillance programs, saying they showed not just the ""hypocrisy"" but also the ""true face"" of the U.S., a Beijing lawyer named Xie Yanyi filed a public information request with the police asking about China's own surveillance operations. Mr. Xie wanted to know: How was the state protecting citizens' rights to online and communications privacy? By what laws was surveillance taking place? Who granted the permission to monitor citizens? Were such activities approved by the National People's Congress, China's parliament? (Here it is in English.)  ""China has only been accusing the United States,"" but is silent about its own surveillance, Mr. Xie said in a Skype interview. ""I don't oppose the government legally managing the public's interest,"" said Mr. Xie. ""But it should not overstep its powers. I hope this will make people face the problem here too. China's surveillance system is extremely wild, there are no rules governing it that are worth speaking of."" Mr. Xie, a lawyer at the Beijing Kaitai Law Firm, who said he filed the request as a private citizen, said there were three programs in particular he wanted to know more about: Golden Shield, Great Wall and Green Dam. Golden Shield is over a decade old, an overarching monitoring network spun by the state that encompasses the colloquially-named Great Firewall of Internet censorship (today it's made up of many different projects with different names); Green Dam is a now-defunct program to install software on computers to filter information. It wasn't immediately clear if Great Wall was a separate program, or if Mr. Xie was referring to the Great Firewall. Chinese surveillance is extensive and invasive, say security researchers, dissidents and rights activists. Cities are installing large-scale, anti-crime systems that encompass telephone, text message, Internet and car number plate monitoring, facial recognition software and a range of other technology, according to this report about one such ""Safe City"" program called ""Project 3.20,"" in the central-eastern cities of Taizhou and Jianjiang. Since Mr. Snowden's leaks earlier this month, Chinese state-run media have loudly criticized the cybermonitoring practices of the U.S., especially following allegations that the N.S.A. hacked into at least one backbone of China's Internet, at Tsinghua University, and targeted people and organizations in Hong Kong and the mainland of China. It has all got ordinary Chinese talking, said Mr. Xie - many for the first time. Because it was happening elsewhere, and the state itself was talking about it, ordinary people could join in the discussion. ""You could call this an 'enlightenment moment' for many people,"" he said. ""After Prism started we could openly talk about it, on bulletin boards, on Weibo,"" or China's popular microblogs. ""Most people were critical about the U.S. and supported Snowden. They felt the U.S. had overstepped its boundaries,"" he said. ""The Chinese government was very happy."" Then the discussion started shifting to take in China's own surveillance issues. ""After a while people began to talk about domestic surveillance,"" Mr. Xie said. Some comments were ""strongly controlled,"" or censored, he said. While state media have focused its criticisms on U.S. ""hypocrisy,"" and not criticized the intrinsic concept of surveillance, recent remarks by a Ministry of National Defense spokesman, Col. Yang Yujun, and a surge of commentary in state-run media ""appear aimed at persuading Chinese citizens that their government holds the moral high ground in Internet issues,"" wrote my colleague Chris Buckley. One cybersecurity expert disagreed that it does. ""There are some stark differences between the United States and China when it comes to surveillance, transparency, and the rule of law, particularly as it relates to access to information requests,"" said Greg Walton, an Internet specialist formerly at the University of Toronto, now a cybersecurity consultant based in India. ""Mr. Xie won't receive meaningful answers to his request for information because of absurd state secrets laws that trump regulations on open government,"" Mr. Walton predicted. ""Human rights researchers in the West know remarkably little about the surveillance state in China. The Chinese people know very little."" Mr. Xie said a key aim of the information request is not only to learn more about his government's surveillance activities and their legality, but also to try to further what he says is a global cause: the need for a new security architecture aimed at protecting citizens' rights to privacy. That included protecting intellectual property rights, he said. A key U.S. complaint against China has been that China has for years engaged in economic espionage. ""We are all facing a new challenge,"" he said. ""We need a United Nations treaty, an international framework for this."" Said Mr. Walton via Skype chat from India: ""It is hypocritical for China to use Mr. Snowden's leaks to attack the U.S. internet freedom agenda, just as it is hypocritical for the U.S. to restrict the 'rules of the road' to the theft of intellectual property - claiming that it doesn't engage in economic espionage against its competitors - or even allies."" He said, ""According to the European Parliament, for example, the N.S.A. has spied on Airbus to the benefit of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas."" ""We are all in this together, and where we do need international norms first and foremost is in defense of the right to openly debate and discuss global issues such as surveillance,"" he said. ""Civil society has got to be protected from state-sponsored espionage - and in this area China has a dreadful record - a decade of aggressive digital spying against anyone who they feel challenges them - from the Dalai Lama to foreign correspondents, scholars to human rights activists.""

American Express to Pay $75 Million Over Credit-Card Practices,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has ordered American Express to pay more than $75 million to settle claims that it charged improper fees and misled its credit card customers over so-called add-on products like identity fraud protection. American Express will have to refund $59.5 million to more than 335,000 consumers over what the bureau called ""illegal credit card practices."" American Express will also have to pay a $9.6 million cash penalty to the bureau, according to a statement issued on Tuesday.   The settlement is the latest government enforcement action aimed at cracking down on credit card firms, which have come under tougher scrutiny as federal regulators have sought tighter restrictions on hidden fees and penalties.  The bureau said one problematic product involved American Express's ""account protector,"" which was marketed as a way for customers to wipe out their minimum monthly payment if they lost their job or had a disability.  But the bureau said that in reality, the benefit payment was limited to 2.5 percent of the consumer's outstanding balance, up to $500. In many cases, that amount that was canceled was less than the minimum payment due. The bureau also says American Express unfairly charged interest and fees, some of which caused customers to exceed their credit limits, resulting in additional fees.  The agency also took issue with how American Express billed for its identity fraud protection services. The bureau said that American Express began charging consumers fees for the service, sometimes for several years, even before it had obtained the authorization necessary to begin monitoring the consumers' credit information. About ""85 percent of consumers who enrolled in the identity protection products paid the full product fee without receiving all of the advertised benefits,"" the bureau said in a statement. ""In some cases, consumers paid for these services for several years without receiving all of the promised benefits."" Another product was the company's ""Lost Wallet"" product, which was intended to assist card members in Puerto Rico with canceling and replacing lost or stolen credit cards. The bureau said that product was not adequately marketed in Spanish. As a result, customers were not properly informed of the required steps necessary to take advantage of the product.  American Express said it had taken steps to rectify the problems. It will also issue refunds to customers who were affected by the settlement, or checks to consumers who no longer hold accounts with the company.  ""As previously reported, American Express continues to conduct internal reviews designed to identify issues, correct them and ensure that its products and practices meet a high standard of quality,"" the company said in a statement.  In addition to paying penalties and reimbursements, American Express was ordered to hire an independent third party to review the company's add-on products.  The agency said the settlement covered consumers who were customers from 2000 to 2012. The company will also pay $3.6 million to  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and $3 million to  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which worked with the bureau on the investigation. This isn't the first time American Express has come under fire for its credit card business. Last year, the consumer protection agency ordered the company to return $85 million to consumers who had been the victims of illegal marketing, billing and debt collection practices.   "
Silicon Valley Companies Lobbying Against Europe's Data Privacy Proposals,"Silicon Valley technology companies and the United States government are pushing hard against Europe's effort to enact sweeping privacy protection for digital data. Several proposed laws working their way through the European Parliament could give 500 million consumers the ability to block or limit many forms of online Web tracking and targeted advertising. All the major American tech companies have directed their lobbyists in Brussels, where the Parliament is based, to press to weaken or remove these proposals from the European provisions. And the United States Commerce Department is lobbying on behalf of the Obama administration, which is concerned that sweeping new privacy controls could hurt the United States tech industry in Europe. This week, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Consumer Federation of America and the Friends of Privacy U.S.A., an offshoot of the London-based Privacy International, weighed in with a different message: Europe needs to pass tough restrictions to save the digital economy, not destroy it.  The dispute has brought into the open how much Europe and the United States differ on privacy rights and their role in the digital economy. Barry Steinhardt, the chairman of Friends of Privacy, founded last year, called it a ''titanic clash.'' ''The rest of the world is looking to see who will prevail because the Asians, Latin Americans and Africans all need to do business with the U.S. and Europe,'' Mr. Steinhardt said. ''So this is extraordinarily important for Americans.'' Mr. Steinhardt and his allies in the battle -- Susan Grant, the director of protection for the consumer federation, and Ben Wizner, a lawyer who focuses on speech, privacy and technology at the A.C.L.U. -- argued their case at a meeting this week with European members of Parliament. ''We are here to correct the record,'' Mr. Wizner said. ''Certainly the U.S. government has been making misleading statements about the state of electronic privacy law in the U.S., how consumer protections are as strong in the U.S. as in Europe. But that is simply not the case.'' Mr. Wizner said the United States had no equivalent to Europe's general data protection law. American law, he said, guarantees consumer privacy only in specific cases, like medical and financial records, but permits online companies to conduct unfettered data mining with only take-it-or-leave-it privacy controls. Under the European proposals, Web businesses would be unable to perform basic collecting and profiling of individual computer users unless they gave their explicit consent as part of policies that allow them to specify what kinds of information could be collected and for what purpose. Businesses would also have to permanently remove and delete personal information upon request, and national regulators would gain the ability to fine companies up to 2 percent of their annual sales for not complying. The proposals are before the European Parliament and a council of 27 European Union justice ministers, who are trying to put together consensus positions. Parliament is expected to complete its draft by late April and would then enter negotiations with the justice ministers over the remainder of the year, with adoption expected in early 2014. The outcome of the debate is critical to United States technology companies, which typically generate a third or more of their sales in the European Union. During a speech in Brussels on Dec. 4, the United States ambassador to the union, William E. Kennard, urged lawmakers to amend parts of the legislation that would require businesses to obtain explicit consent from consumers before collecting and mining data and to remove all traces of personal data from the Internet upon request. Proposals to weaken the restrictions on collecting data have been submitted by eBay and Amazon, as well as by industry groups like Digital Europe, a Brussels association whose members include Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, I.B.M., Oracle, the Google subsidiary Motorola Mobility, Texas Instruments and Dell, along with European and global tech companies. Some of the lobbying efforts have already borne fruit. Faced with the United States industry opposition, some supporters of the proposals are worried about the prospects of producing meaningful changes. ''The outcome is very unclear at this point,'' said Jérémie Zimmermann, a spokesman for a French digital rights group, La Quadrature du Net. ''The U.S. lobbying on this has been very effective so far. It is impossible to tell what will happen.'' "
"Schools Use Web Tools, And Data Is Seen at Risk","Public schools around the country are adopting web-based services that collect and analyze personal details about students without adequately safeguarding the information from potential misuse by service providers, according to new research. A study, which is expected to be released on Friday, by the Center on Law and Information Policy at Fordham Law School in New York, found weaknesses in the protection of student information in the contracts that school districts sign when outsourcing web-based tasks to service companies. Many contracts, the study found, failed to list the type of information collected while others did not prohibit vendors from selling personal details -- like names, contact information or health status -- or using that information for marketing purposes.  ''We found that when school districts are transferring student information to cloud service providers, by and large key privacy protections are absent from those arrangements,'' said Joel R. Reidenberg, a law professor at Fordham who led the study. ''We're worried about the implications for students over time, how their personal information may be used or misused.'' Schools have adopted programs like automated student assessment or online homework management systems with the idea that digital, data-driven education could ultimately lead to better test scores, grades and graduation rates. Education technology software for prekindergarten to 12th grade is an estimated $8 billion market, according to the Software and Information Industry Association. But some privacy specialists, industry executives and district officials say that federal education privacy rules and local district policies are not keeping up with advances like learning apps that can record a child's every keystroke or algorithms that classify academic performance. Without explicit prohibitions on the nonacademic use of the information, specialists warn that unflattering data could hypothetically be shared with colleges or employers, to the detriment of the student. The Fordham study suggested that some districts might not fully grasp the implications of outsourcing data handling or may lack the negotiating power to insist on contracts that restrict information use. ''The report raises the possibility that abuses could happen with student data if contracting practices don't come up to snuff,'' said Kathleen Styles, the chief privacy officer of the Department of Education. Although the agency had no evidence of such abuses, she said, it is developing best practices for schools to use in ''contracting out for web services and for transparency with parents.'' Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, schools that receive federal funding must generally obtain written permission from parents before sharing students' educational records. An exception allows school districts to share student information with companies, like those providing student information systems, without parental consent. The exception requires school districts to have direct control over such contractors' use of student information; if contractors misuse the data, regulators may ban districts from sharing further data with those companies. In a statement, the Software and Information Industry Association faulted the Fordham study for examining school contracts and policies, but not actual industry practices. The group said the law had created a business culture that respected student privacy. The Fordham researchers examined how schools approached student data privacy by first calling officials at a cross-section of small, medium and large school districts in different parts of the country; then they used open-records laws to request copies of each district's Web services contracts and policies for staff technology use. Microsoft provided an unrestricted grant for the research. The study reported that districts hire online services to monitor individual student progress, analyze aggregate performances of classes and schools, host school data and manage school transportation. Although the school systems were required to respond to the request for information, only 20 of 54 districts provided full documentation by the deadline, the study said. Researchers said they encountered ''significant difficulty reaching any district personnel who were familiar with the district's outsourcing practices.'' ''When you talk about transparency, the fact that we had to be persistent, I think, is a public policy problem,'' Dr. Reidenberg said. Among the districts that did provide documents, less than a quarter of the contracts specified the purpose for which student information would be disclosed, the study said; and less than 7 percent restricted companies from selling student data or using it for marketing. Several districts lacked policies governing staff members' computer use -- meaning that teachers would potentially be able to sign up for free apps or sites that collected information about students without school officials vetting the programs. The study suggests that school districts have wildly varying degrees of legal expertise and resources to devote to data protection. Certainly, many districts make an effort to be vigilant. The South Orangetown Central School District in Blauvelt, N.Y., for example, is conducting an audit to examine how its contracts cover sharing or reuse of student data. ''The kinds of applications, software and online resources have changed so much in such a short period of time that it's hard for districts to keep pace,'' said the district superintendent, Ken Mitchell. ''There are so many questions about the data sharing between primary and secondary vendors that, until we have that fully understood, we need to slow this thing down.'' The Fordham study urged that contracts specify the type of services a company provides, list the types of information collected and limit the redisclosure of students' details. The researchers also recommended that education officials notify parents about the nature of information disclosed to third parties and post information about privacy protections on district websites. Some industry experts envision a national approach to protecting student information. Steve Mutkoski, the government policy director for Microsoft's worldwide public sector business, recommended that the technology industry voluntarily agree not to use student data for advertising, marketing or profiling students, as his company has done for schools that use certain Microsoft software. ''At a bare minimum, if that is not going to reach an industry consensus,'' Mr. Mutkoski said, ''there should at least be greater transparency about the use that vendors plan to make of the data.''

White House Plans to Add Technology Adviser,"The White House is looking to Silicon Valley to expand its team of technology advisers. CNET and AllThingsD reported on Tuesday that President Obama has picked Nicole Wong, a legal director at Twitter, to be the White House's first chief privacy officer.  People familiar with the situation said that the White House does not intend to create a chief privacy officer post, but is looking to add a senior adviser to its chief technology officer, Todd Park. These people described the hiring discussions as developing and said that Ms. Wong was among the leading contenders, who also include other Silicon Valley executives. Social media companies and e-mail providers increasingly find themselves on the front lines of high-level policy discussions concerning privacy. Twitter, Facebook and Google must regularly contend with government demands that they hand over users' personal information. According to a recent Electronic Frontier Foundation survey, the companies are cooperating to varying degrees. The survey - titled ""Who Has Your Back?"" - examined the privacy policies of 18 major Internet companies. Twitter got top marks with six out of six stars, compared with a single star each for Apple, Yahoo and AT&T. (Verizon was awarded none.) Before joining Twitter last year, Ms. Wong spent eight years at Google where she oversaw policy, privacy and copyright-related issues. She was the subject of a lengthy 2008 New York Times Magazine article, which said she and her team ""have arguably more influence over the contours of online expression than anyone else on the planet.""

Privacy Officials Worldwide Press Google About Glass,"Ten government privacy and data protection officials from seven countries have asked Google to address privacy concerns related to its wearable computing device, Glass. The letter was sent to Larry Page, Google's chief executive, by 10 commissioners from Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Israel and Switzerland. It comes after a letter sent by eight members of Congress in May raising similar questions about Glass and privacy.  ""We would be very interested in hearing about the privacy implications of this new product and the steps you are taking to ensure that, as you move forward with Google Glass, individuals' privacy rights are respected around the world,"" the officials wrote. Glass, which is not yet available to the public, tethers to a user's cellphone and has much of the same functionality, like text messaging and phone calls. It can also take photos and record video hands-free, and apps from news organizations, social networks, Google Maps and others send alerts and updates to a screen above the user's right eye. The officials raised fears of ""ubiquitous surveillance"" and asked about Google's privacy safeguards, what it plans to do with the data the devices collect and how it is addressing ""the broader social and ethical issues"" raised by Glass. They lamented that Google has not yet reached out to data protection authorities to discuss the privacy implications of Glass. Mr. Page addressed similar questions at Google's shareholders meeting this month, where he made his first public comments about the issue. He said that many people already carried cellphone cameras everywhere they go, and that Glass was no different. ""People worry about a lot of things that, when we use the products, don't turn out to be an actual concern,"" Mr. Page said. Many people at Google wear Glass, he said. ""When you go into the bathroom, you don't collapse in terror that people might be wearing these in the bathroom, just like you don't collapse in terror that someone will hold up a cellphone in the bathroom."" ""I would encourage you not to create fear and concern about technological change until it's out there and we understand the issues,"" Mr. Page said. Susan Molinari, Google's vice president for  public policy, responded this month to the members of Congress. She wrote that Glass would not include facial recognition, users would be able to wipe data from the device if it was misplaced or stolen and that Google was relying on early users currently testing the device to help the company shape the discussion about it. In the letter, the privacy commissioners said they wanted a demo of the as-yet-unavailable product. ""Would Google be willing to demonstrate the device to our offices and allow any interested data protection authorities to test it?"" they asked.  "
"With Montana's Lead, States May Demand Warrants for Cellphone Data","The law rarely keeps up with technological advances - except in Montana. Legislators in that state recently passed a bill that requires the police to obtain a search warrant, based on probable cause, before they can use a cellphone carrier's records to establish a suspect's location.  That kind of ""metadata"" can be incredibly valuable, as law enforcement agencies discovered long before the rest of us. The cellphones we carry everywhere establish a clear log of our daily travels and can go a long way in telling the story of our lives. In recognition of that fact, the Montana Legislature this spring passed a location information privacy bill, which requires a search warrant for location information recorded by an ""electronic device."" There are exceptions to the warrant requirement, including when the cellphone is reported stolen or to respond to a cellphone user's emergency call. Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana, signed it into law on May 6. The American Civil Liberties Union, which tracks cellphone tracking laws across the country, called it thefirst such state legislation. In so doing, Montana stole California's thunder: that state's Legislature had passed a warrant law for location tracking last year, but Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed it, saying that it did not ""strike the right balance"" between the needs of citizens and law enforcement. Over a dozen other states have eyed similar measures just this year. In Maine, a location information privacy bill went to the governor's desk last Wednesday. In Texas, a similar bill failed to muster enough votes in the Statehouse. The Massachusetts Legislature is scheduled to hold a hearing next Tuesday on a measure that would require search warrants for location records as well as content of cellphone communications. Congress has been slow to act on the issue. Bills have been introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, with little movement. The courts meanwhile have rendered mixed verdicts on how law enforcement can extract location history from telecommunications carriers. Among the most remarkable is an armed robbery trial in Maryland, where the police obtained 221 days of cellphone location data for the suspects. The law enforcement authorities obtained a court order from a magistrate, but not a warrant. The A.C.L.U., along with several other groups, filed an amicus brief in the case this week in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that at a minimum, the police should obtain a warrant, based on probable cause, to gain access to cellphone location records. The Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on the legal limits of location tracking using a cellphone, though it ruled in a landmark 2012 case that the police must obtain a search warrant before placing a GPS tracking device on a suspect's vehicle.  "
Daily Report: Privacy Suit Against Google Will Continue,"SAN FRANCISCO - In a major legal setback for Google, a federal appeals court said on Tuesday that a lawsuit accusing the Internet giant of illegal wiretapping could proceed, David Streitfeld reports.  The ruling, which comes at a moment when privacy online is being hotly debated, has its origins in a much-publicized Google initiative, Street View, which tried to map the man-made world. In addition to photographs, Street View vehicles secretly collected e-mail, passwords, images and other personal information from unencrypted home computer networks. The scooping of data brought outrage and investigations in at least a dozen countries when it was first revealed in Germany in 2010. It also prompted a handful of lawsuits by United States citizens who said Google had violated their privacy and was illegally wiretapping them. Those suits were condensed into one case, which was heard by a California court. Google tried to get the case dismissed, saying the Wi-Fi communications it captured were ""readily accessible to the general public"" and therefore not a violation of federal wiretapping laws. The lower court rejected that argument, and on Tuesday the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit did, too. ""This is an important opinion for privacy rights,"" said Kathryn E. Barnett of Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, one of the law firms working for the plaintiffs. ""It says that when you are in your home, you have a right to privacy in your communications. Someone just can't drive by and seize them.""   "
Daily Report: A Proposed Reset Button for Children Online,"SAN FRANCISCO - California legislators, faced with the problem of reckless online behavior by children, and of the sometimes outsize and life-changing repercussions from that behavior, are trying to solve the problem with the first measure in the country to give minors the legal right to scrub away their online indiscretions. The legislation puts the state in the middle of a turbulent debate over how best to protect children and their privacy on the Internet, and whether states should even be trying to tame the Web, Somini Sengupta reports.  The governor, Jerry Brown, has taken no position on the bill. He has until mid-October to sign it, after which, without his signature, the legislation becomes law. California is often in the vanguard when it comes to digital privacy. It was the first state to require companies to report data breaches, and it requires Web sites and mobile apps to post privacy policies that explain how personal information is used. A recently passed law requires Web sites to tell users whether they honor browsers' do-not-track signals. The right-to-delete, or eraser, provision is part of a broader bill that prohibits Web sites, which have ""actual knowledge"" that a minor is using the site based on a profile and activity on the site, from running ads for a range of products - including alcohol, spray paint, tattoos, tanning beds and e-cigarettes. The eraser section compels online sites to let users under 18 delete rants, tweets, pictures, status updates and other material. Although many companies, including Facebook and Twitter, already offer this option to their users, the California bill would make it a right across the Internet for children who live in that state.  ""Kids and teenagers often self-reveal before they self-reflect,"" said James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a San Francisco-based advocacy group that pushed for the law. ""It's a very important milestone.""   "
A Conversation With Lavabit's Founder,"For nearly a decade, Ladar Levison ran Lavabit, a secure e-mail service that served as an alternative for a tech-savvy crowd that cared about privacy. Then, last July, after two months of haggling with the F.B.I., Mr. Levison shuttered the service rather than give the government untrammeled access to his users'  communications and everything he had built.  What happened in those eight weeks had never been told, in part, because Mr. Levison was subject to a court order of silence. But last week, a federal judge unsealed documents in the case, allowing the tech entrepreneur to speak candidly for the first time about his ordeal, which involved being summoned at short notice to testify before a grand jury in Virginia, being held in contempt of court and fined $10,000, and being threatened with arrest for saying too much when he closed his business.  ""Freedom is the ability to make a decision that others would disagree with,"" Mr. Levison said of his decision to close his business. ""The more decisions our government makes for us, the less free we are."" Until last summer, Mr. Levison, a Republican of libertarian leanings, had not been active in politics. But since August, he has been embraced in the technology world as a symbol of defiant courage.  ""I went from being a small-business owner who spent most of my time working with computers to a political activist who spends all my time on the road raising awareness about this issue,"" Mr. Levison said. ""I haven't quite adjusted to the role of poster child for Internet privacy.""  Mr. Levison sat down with Marcus Mabry of The Times to discuss how he has become a symbol in the backlash against government spying, as well as the impact of the ordeal on his personal life.  "
Daily Report: Google to Sell Users' Endorsements,"Google, following in Facebook's footsteps, wants to sell users' endorsements to marketers to help them hawk their wares, Claire Cain Miller and Vindu Goel report.  On Friday, Google announced an update to its terms of service that allows the company to include adult users' names, photos and comments in ads shown across the Web, based on ratings, reviews and posts they have made on Google Plus and other Google services like YouTube.   When the new ad policy goes live Nov. 11, Google will be able to show what the company calls shared endorsements on Google sites and across the Web, on the more than 2 million sites in Google's display advertising network, which are viewed by an estimated 1 billion people. If a user follows a bakery on Google Plus or gives an album four stars on the Google Play music service, for instance, that person's name, photo and endorsement could show up in ads for that bakery or album. Such product endorsements, especially coming from friends and acquaintances, are a powerful lure to brands, replicating word-of-mouth marketing on a broad scale. ""The trick to any advertising like this is to avoid coming across as creepy to your user base and have them say, 'I didn't want anyone else to know that,'"" said Zachary Reiss-Davis, a Forrester analyst, speaking generally about social ads.  But as Facebook has learned, many users have strong and skeptical feelings about their endorsements being used in ads without their explicit permission. Google said it would give users the chance to opt out of being included in the new endorsements, and people under the age of 18 will automatically be excluded.  Shared endorsements are the latest example of the continual push by Google and other Web companies to collate in one place the reams of personal information people share online and use it to personalize people's online experiences. Privacy advocates say companies do not generally get meaningful consent from their users before using such information. ""Users reasonably expect that their comments should be used as they intended,""said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which has tangled with numerous Internet companies, most recently Facebook, over the use of personal information in ads. ""People don't typically race around handing their friends leaflets and advertisements.""   "
Q&A: Avoiding Mobile Malware," Q.  Why is Android such a big target for malware, and how can I tell if an app may be suspect before I install it?  A.  Android has become the dominant mobile operating system around the world, and like Windows before it, malware writers typically target the most commonly used platform in hopes of snaring the most victims. Not all phones can run the latest, more secure versions of the Android system, which can make them more vulnerable to malicious apps. Third-party app sites help spread malicious software as well.  Common sense and a discerning eye can help keep your device safe. If you want to avoid malicious apps, get new software from trusted sources like the Google Play store or Amazon's Android app store - and avoid installing any apps from random third-party sites. Although it does not make developers go through a formal approval process when submitting new apps, Google does automatically scan apps that are added to its Google Play store for malware. The company has also withdrawn bad apps that have wormed their way into the store. Sticking with apps from well-known developers or apps that have been professionally reviewed can help keep you away from the junk and scam programs that may have made it into the store. (Badly written or spammy apps are a universal problem and Apple's App Store has plenty of those, too.) Even when shopping in the Google Play store, you should thoroughly check out an app before installing it. Be wary of apps that seem to have a lot of downloads and high ratings - but a minimal amount of written reviews - since a scammer may be trying to get attention. You can also check the app's Permissions tab on the Google Play page to see what parts of your Android phone or tablet it wants to use, and then avoid apps that look too invasive. If you like to visit third-party app sites, you may want to consider installing mobile security software from a reliable company. Some apps, like Lookout or F-Secure, also help track lost phones and remotely wipe data - because a missing or stolen device may be more of a security problem than malware for many people anyway.  "
"FireEye Prices I.P.O. at $20, Beating Heightened Expectations","FireEye, a provider of cybersecurity software, priced its initial public offering on Thursday at $20 a share, handily beating expectations.  Earlier this week, the company raised its price range to $15 to $17 a share. Taking advantage of strong demand, the company also increased the number of shares that it sold in the offering by 8 percent, to 15.18 million. Over all, the stock sale raised $303.6 million, valuing the software maker at $2.3 billion. The nine-year-old start-up is one of the latest technology companies to seek a public listing, part of a revival in a largely dormant sector for I.P.O.'s. As of last week, tech companies accounted for just 17 percent of all new offerings, the lowest percentage of all initial stock sales since 2008. But analysts and bankers say that investors remain hungry for promising new I.P.O.'s. Earlier on Thursday, the advertising technology company Rocket Fuel priced its stock sale at the high end of an already raised range, collecting $116 million in proceeds. FireEye is betting that its business - an advanced software package that protects against malicious programs - will prove attractive to new investors. Among its current backers are Sequoia Capital and Norwest Venture Partners. The company reported a $35.8 million loss last year, more than double from the prior year. But its revenue jumped 147 percent, to $83.3 million. FireEye plans to use proceeds from the sale to hire more employees and expand its business. The offering was led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Barclays.  "
"If You're Collecting Our Data, You Ought to Protect It","LAST summer, employees at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration received an in-house newsletter illustrated with mock front pages of USA Today and The Washington Post and seemingly hyperbolic headlines like: ''NASA Laptop Stolen, Potential Compromise of 10,000 Employees' Private Information!'' The catastrophizing turned out to be prescient. On Halloween, just a few months after the newsletter went out, a laptop used by an employee at NASA headquarters in Washington was stolen from a parked car. Subsequently, NASA sent letters to about 10,000 current and former employees and contractors, warning them that the laptop had not been encrypted. The letter explained that confidential details -- like employees' names, birth dates, Social Security numbers and, in some cases, personal information from background checks -- may have been compromised.  When Robert M. Nelson, a solar systems scientist who recently retired after 34 years at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, part of NASA, received the letter, he felt vindicated. Several years earlier, he and 27 other civilian scientists at the lab sued the agency to try to stop it from conducting open-ended background checks of researchers like them who worked on nonmilitary space projects. ''You'd think an agent of NASA would be a little more careful,'' Dr. Nelson says. ''Why does NASA need personal data unrelated to our work and then treat it in such a cavalier way that it is stolen from a car unencrypted?'' NASA has since notified an additional 30,000 people whose personal information may have been on the stolen laptop, says Robert Jacobs, a NASA spokesman. He declined to provide the job title of the person who left the laptop in the car. But he said that there had been no indication of identity theft and that the agency has encrypted practically all of its 38,000 laptops. By now, reports of lost or stolen business devices are so common that many people open data-breach notices from their banks, insurers, medical institutions, schools and state agencies with something like resignation. In fact, negligence by employees and contractors has been a more common cause of corporate data breaches in the United States than malicious attacks, according to a study of 2011 done by the Ponemon Institute, a research center on data security, and financed by Symantec, a data security company. Institutions, companies and government agencies often devote more resources to collecting information about employees and consumers than to protecting it, security specialists say. ''This is an unfortunate but perfectly cautionary tale of not only how we should look more carefully at protecting data after it is collected,'' says Lee Tien, a senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group in San Francisco, ''but also how the data is to be safeguarded before we collect it to make sure it isn't used improperly or disclosed accidentally.'' Dr. Nelson and his colleagues at the Jet Propulsion Lab, which is operated for NASA by the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, didn't set out to become crusaders for workplace data privacy and security. Initially, they wanted only to challenge NASA's background checks, arguing that civilian scientists had a right to keep their romantic, psychiatric and other intimate information private from the government. Besides, they contended, the space agency would not be able to safeguard the information. The scientists took their case all the way to the Supreme Court, only to lose. In 2011, the justices unanimously ruled that NASA had legitimate reasons to look into personal issues, like whether an employee had received drug counseling. A federal law called the Privacy Act of 1974, which restricts how government agencies share a person's data, the justices said, should protect the information obtained in background checks. ''They were clearly wrong,'' says Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington that filed a friend-of-the-court-brief in the case. ''Exactly the problem people anticipated came to pass.'' Privacy advocates say that one obstacle to improving workplace information security is a lack of consequences for employees who compromise personal data. In 2009, for example, the Government Accountability Office issued a report, titled ''NASA Needs to Remedy Vulnerabilities in Key Networks,'' which urged the agency to institute whole-disk encryption for all of its laptops. Unlike simple computer login passwords -- which can often be guessed or bypassed to get to readable files -- disk encryption scrambles files so they can't be read without the correct key. NASA eventually required the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to encrypt its laptops. But at the time of the Halloween theft, not all laptops at agency headquarters itself had been encrypted. Susan Landau, a Guggenheim fellow in cyber security, privacy and public policy, says companies and agencies are unlikely to improve data security without the threat of penalty. ''What are the personal consequences for employees who allow data breaches to happen?'' Ms. Landau asks. ''Until people lose their jobs, nothing is going to change.'' Mr. Jacobs declined to comment about whether NASA had disciplined the employee who left the laptop in the car, saying the issue was ''covered by privacy.'' DR. NELSON did not emerge from his data rights battle unscathed. Caltech issued disciplinary citations to five employees of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, including Dr. Nelson, who had used their nasa.gov e-mail addresses to send messages to thousands of colleagues about the Supreme Court decision. An employee who commits a second offense after receiving such a warning could be fired, Dr. Nelson says. Lawren B. Markle, a spokesman for Caltech, says the employees used government resources, paid for by taxpayers, ''to spam thousands of individuals, government officials and agencies, other businesses, and colleges and universities'' with their political views. ''As a federal contractor,'' Mr. Markle wrote in an e-mail, ''we cannot allow the government resources entrusted to us to be used in this manner and particularly not to lobby for political positions.'' He added that a second warning would not automatically lead to dismissal. ''The outcome would depend on the severity of the conduct and the history of the employee's service,'' he said. The five employees have filed cases with the National Labor Relations Board, saying that they were unfairly disciplined because the e-mails were work-related. ''In the short time since the Supreme Court decision, tens of thousands of people have had their data compromised,'' Dr. Nelson says. ''For warning about what would eventually become true, we received disciplinary citations.'' An administrative judge is to rule on the matter in the coming months, but a Los Angeles office of the labor relations agency found merit in the scientists' cases, concluding that Caltech unlawfully issued disciplinary warnings for the e-mails, says Mori Rubin, the regional director of the office. Her office also concluded that Caltech had disciplined the scientists for practices that other employees routinely undertook without penalty. Such are the risks of taking a public stance on privacy.

Daily Report: Spam Network Exposed in Russian Legal Case,"MOSCOW - A court ruling this summer provided a peek into the shrouded world of the Viagra-spam industry, a multimillion-dollar illegal enterprise with tentacles stretching from Russia to India. Around the world every day, millions of people open their e-mail in-boxes to find invitations to buy Viagra or some other drug, potion or device to enhance sexual performance, Andrew E. Kramer reports.  Who sends these notes and how they make money had remained a mystery to most recipients. The court put names and faces to a shadowy global network of infected computers known outside Russia as Festi and inside the country as Topol-Mailer, named after an intercontinental ballistic missile, the Topol-M. It was powerful enough to generate, at times, up to a third of all spam e-mail messages circulating globally. Prosecutors say Igor A. Artimovich was one of two principal programmers who controlled an illegal network of virus-infected computers in a group that included a former signals intelligence officer in the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the successor agency to the K.G.B. Once they control the infected computers, they are able to use software embedded on home and business computers to send persistent e-mails. The owner of an infected computer usually never knows the PC has been compromised. More often than not these days, those infected computers are in India, Brazil and other developing countries where users cannot afford virus protection. But the high-end programming of viruses often takes place in Russia.  "
Report Indicates More Extensive Cooperation by Microsoft on Surveillance,"WASHINGTON -- Microsoft has collaborated with the National Security Agency more extensively than it previously acknowledged, providing the spy agency with up-to-date access to its customer data whenever the company changes its encryption and related software technology, according to a new report based on disclosures by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden. Quoting classified internal N.S.A. newsletters obtained from Mr. Snowden, The Guardian newspaper reported that Microsoft had helped the security agency find ways to circumvent its encryption on its Outlook.com portal's encrypted Web chat function, and that the agency was given what The Guardian described as ''pre-encryption stage'' access to e-mail on Outlook, including Hotmail e-mail.  The Guardian, which did not release the N.S.A. documents that it quoted, said that Microsoft had also provided the F.B.I. with access to its SkyDrive service, a cloud storage service with millions of users. Microsoft, according to The Guardian, also worked with the F.B.I. to study how Outlook allowed users to create e-mail aliases, while Skype, now owned by Microsoft, worked with the government to help it collect both the video and audio of conversations. It also reported that information collected through the N.S.A. program code-named Prism was shared with both the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. Microsoft said in a statement that it only provided access to its systems when required to do so by court orders. ''We only ever comply with orders about specific accounts or identifiers, and we would not respond to the kind of blanket orders discussed in the press over the past few weeks,'' the company said in its statement. ''To be clear, Microsoft does not provide any government with blanket or direct access to SkyDrive, Outlook.com, Skype or any Microsoft product. Finally, when we upgrade or update products legal obligations may in some circumstances require that we maintain the ability to provide information in response to a law enforcement or national security request.'' The latest disclosure from documents leaked by Mr. Snowden underscores the increasingly close ties between the N.S.A. and the high-tech community. Microsoft, Facebook and other companies have already been forced to address questions about their cooperation with the agency following Mr. Snowden's disclosure of the Prism surveillance program. Many of the companies have repeatedly denied that they agree to blanket collection requests from the government, despite evidence that the government has for years collected huge amounts of phone and Internet data from American citizens. An N.S.A. Internet metadata collection program revealed by Mr. Snowden, for example, was halted in 2011 only after two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee began to question its value. Fearing a negative public response to their cooperation, some Silicon Valley companies are beginning to openly push back against the security agency. Yahoo, for example, is now asking the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the secret court that rules on data collection requests by the government, to allow it to make public the record of its 2008 challenge to the constitutionality of the law requiring it to provide its customer data to the agency. A Yahoo spokeswoman said Thursday that the company was ''seeking permission from the FISA court to unseal the arguments and orders from the 2008 case.'' Yahoo said in a public filing with the FISA court this week that releasing documents about the 2008 case would allow it '' to demonstrate that it objected strenuously to the directives that are now the subject of debate, and objected at every stage of the proceeding, but that these objections were overruled and its request for a stay was denied.'' Signs of a popular backlash against the security agency's large-scale collection of the personal data of Americans have convinced a leading privacy advocate in Congress that the Obama administration may soon begin to back away from the most aggressive components of the agency's domestic surveillance programs. The advocate, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview Thursday that he believed that the security agency might soon abandon the bulk collection of the telephone calling data of millions of Americans. The current controversy over the agency's surveillance policies was first set off after Mr. Snowden leaked a secret FISA court order telling Verizon to turn over calling data from all of its customers. Mr. Wyden now believes that the White House is beginning to recognize that the program raises so many privacy concerns that it is willing to drop it. ''I have a feeling that the administration is getting concerned about the bulk phone records collection, and that they are thinking about whether to move administratively to stop it,'' he said. He added he believed that the continuing controversy prompted by Mr. Snowden had changed the political calculus in Congress over the balance between security and civil liberties, which has been heavily weighted toward security since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ''I think we are making a comeback,'' Mr. Wyden said, referring to privacy and civil liberties advocates. "
The Digital Kingdom,"ORLANDO, Fla. -- Imagine Walt Disney World with no entry turnstiles. Cash? Passé: Visitors would wear rubber bracelets encoded with credit card information, snapping up corn dogs and Mickey Mouse ears with a tap of the wrist. Smartphone alerts would signal when it is time to ride Space Mountain without standing in line. Fantasyland? Hardly. It happens starting this spring. Disney in the coming months plans to begin introducing a vacation management system called MyMagic+ that will drastically change the way Disney World visitors -- some 30 million people a year -- do just about everything.  The initiative is part of a broader effort, estimated by analysts to cost between $800 million and $1 billion, to make visiting Disney parks less daunting and more amenable to modern consumer behavior. Disney is betting that happier guests will spend more money. ''If we can enhance the experience, more people will spend more of their leisure time with us,'' said Thomas O. Staggs, chairman of Disney Parks and Resorts. The ambitious plan moves Disney deeper into the hotly debated terrain of personal data collection. Like most major companies, Disney wants to have as much information about its customers' preferences as it can get, so it can appeal to them more efficiently. The company already collects data to use in future sales campaigns, but parts of MyMagic+ will allow Disney for the first time to track guest behavior in minute detail. Did you buy a balloon? What attractions did you ride and when? Did you shake Goofy's hand, but snub Snow White? If you fully use MyMagic+, databases will be watching, allowing Disney to refine its offerings and customize its marketing messages. Disney is aware of potential privacy concerns, especially regarding children. The plan, which comes as the federal government is trying to strengthen online privacy protections, could be troublesome for a company that some consumers worry is already too controlling. But Disney has decided that MyMagic+ is essential. The company must aggressively weave new technology into its parks -- without damaging the sense of nostalgia on which the experience depends -- or risk becoming irrelevant to future generations, Mr. Staggs said. From a business perspective, he added, MyMagic+ could be ''transformational.'' Aside from benefiting Disney's bottom line, the initiative could alter the global theme parks business. Disney is not the first vacation company to use wristbands equipped with radio frequency identification, or RFID, chips. Great Wolf Resorts, an operator of 11 water parks in North America, has been using them since 2006. But Disney's global parks operation, which has an estimated 121.4 million admissions a year and generates $12.9 billion in revenue, is so huge that it can greatly influence consumer behavior. ''When Disney makes a move, it moves the culture,'' said Steve Brown, chief operating officer for Lo-Q, a British company that provides line management and ticketing systems for theme parks and zoos. Disney World guests currently plod through entrance turnstiles, redeeming paper tickets, and then decide what to ride; food and merchandise are bought with cash or credit cards. (Disney hotel key cards can also be used to charge items.) People race to FastPass kiosks, which dispense a limited number of free line-skipping tickets. But gridlock quickly sets in and most people wait. And wait. In contrast, MyMagic+ will allow users of a new Web site and app -- called My Disney Experience -- to preselect three FastPasses before they leave home for rides or V.I.P. seating for parades, fireworks and character meet-and-greets. Orlando-bound guests can also preregister for RFID bracelets. These so-called MagicBands will function as room key, park ticket, FastPass and credit card. MagicBands can also be encoded with all sorts of personal details, allowing for more personalized interaction with Disney employees. Before, the employee playing Cinderella could say hello only in a general way. Now -- if parents opt in -- hidden sensors will read MagicBand data, providing information needed for a personalized greeting: ''Hi, Angie,'' the character might say without prompting. ''I understand it's your birthday.'' The data will also be used to make waiting areas for rides (''scene ones'' in Disney parlance) less of a drag. A new Magic Kingdom ride called Under the Sea, for instance, features a robotic version of Scuttle the sea gull from ''The Little Mermaid'' that will be able to chitchat with MagicBand wearers. ''We want to take experiences that are more passive and make them as interactive as possible -- moving from, 'Cool, look at that talking bird,' to 'Wow, amazing, that bird is talking directly to me,' '' said Bruce Vaughn, chief creative executive for Walt Disney Imagineering. Guests will not be forced to use the MagicBand system, and people who do try it will decide how much information to share. An online options menu, for instance, will offer various controls: Do you want park employees to know your name? Do you want Disney to send you special offers when you get home? What about during your stay? ''I may walk in and feel good about giving information about myself and my wife, but maybe we don't want to give much about the children,'' Mr. Staggs said. Still, once using the MagicBand, even if selecting the most restrictive settings, Disney sensors will gather general information about how the visitor uses the park. Rumors about MyMagic+ have been circulating on Disney fan blogs for months and offer a window into the likely debate over the service. ''Although I know this type of technology is making its way into every facet of life, it still makes me feel a bit creeped out,'' wrote Jayne Townsley on StitchKingdom.com. Pam Falcioni, another StitchKingdom user, had the opposite response. ''I think it sounds awesome,'' she wrote, adding, ''As far as 'Big Brother' watching over us as we wander the parks, anyone worried about 'real' privacy wouldn't be wandering around a theme park full of security cameras.'' The logistical challenges involved in pulling this off are extensive. Disney has 60,000 employees here and many must be retrained to use new technology. Already, Disney has installed free Wi-Fi at Disney World, a 40-square-mile area, so smartphone users can access the My Disney Experience app more readily. And all of the new procedures must be communicated to Super Bowl-size crowds daily. What happens if your MagicBand is lost or stolen? Park employees will be trained to deactivate them or guests can use the My Disney Experience app, a Disney spokeswoman said. As a safety precaution, Disney will also require guests to enter a PIN when using the wristbands to make purchases of $50 or more. ''The bands themselves will contain no personal identifiable information,'' Mr. Staggs said. Mr. Staggs said Disney's board decided to move ahead with the technology upgrades in February 2011 only after identifying multiple ways in which the initiative could expand profits. ''If Disney can drive more value from existing infrastructure by layering on technology, that is extremely powerful,'' said Mr. Brown of Lo-Q. ''They can't just compete by building new rides; it's already a theme-park arms race out there.'' Disney expects MagicBands to turn into a big business in and of themselves; the company plans to introduce collectible sets of MagicBand accessories and charms. Prodding guests to do more advance planning, combined with the tracking of guests as they roam the parks, will help Disney manage its work force more efficiently. More advance planning will also help lock visitors into Disney once they arrive in Orlando, discouraging people, for instance, from making impromptu visits to Universal's Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Some cosmetic changes to the parks are included in the initiative's cost. For instance, eventually guests will no longer enter the parks through turnstiles. Instead, they will tap their MagicBand on a post. Mr. Staggs explained that research indicated that guests -- particularly mothers with strollers -- viewed the turnstiles as an unpleasant barrier. ''Small, subtle things can make a big difference,'' Mr. Staggs said. "
Google Seeks Volunteers For Web Tracking,"Suppose a stranger showed up at your house, a shiny new modem under his arm. He says he wants to attach the device to your computer so he can see everything you do online - how you update your Facebook friends with news about your cats, how you use Twitter to flatter your boss, how you single-handedly are keeping the cult of Kim Kardashian alive. He says he will use the information to help make the Internet run more smoothly. All mankind will benefit. It probably wouldn't take you long to slam the door. You might consider moving your couch up against it too, just to be sure.  But what if he said he was working for Google, a company that has promised to do no evil, and offered you five shiny new dollar bills to sweeten the deal? Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of people are confronting this question. Google has hired a research company, GfK Custom Research, to send out old-fashioned letters seeking cooperation for its Screenwise Panel project, a tracking effort intended to help not only Google but ""experts at universities"" conduct ""important research on trends in the way people use media."" Full-scale participation, the letter promises, will reap even more loot: $50 a month ""or even more."" As usual with Google, it wants information to flow in only one direction: toward Google. The history of Screenwise is thus a little vague. It was never officially announced but the tech media noticed a sign-up page early last year, and some sites wrote about it at the time. As Search Engine Land noted, ""the timing of this program seems odd, especially considering the backlash that Google has faced over the upcoming changes to its privacy policy."" A few weeks later, Google acknowledged the existence of Screenwise in a blog post. The Street View controversy, where Google secretly scooped up Internet traffic from households and then fought a full disclosure of its activities, also did not seem to bode well for another data collection program, even if this one was completely opt-in. Initially, perhaps, people loved the idea of participating in Screenwise. The sign-up page reportedly crashed because of heavy traffic. That was the last anyone heard of it. Even Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which keeps an attentive watch on privacy issues at the search engine, figured Google had abandoned Screenwise. But it merely changed tactics. Despite that supposed flood of interest in signing up, the program still needed many more participants. It appears that people did not love the idea quite as much as it seemed. And so Google started quietly seeking more people to join. I heard about the new Screenwise from my sister-in-law, who got a letter addressed to ""current resident."" With so many devices in her family, Google was offering to pay about $100 a month. That was tempting, but Carolyn had some privacy qualms. Knowing that Google is tracking via Gmail and Chrome just about everything you are doing is one thing; actively encouraging this through a special modem is another. As Carolyn was debating whether to proceed, Screenwise called her. ""It was kind of a high-pressure conversation,"" she told me. ""The woman on the line insisted that all they wanted to know was how much time we were on the Internet each day, not what we were doing there. Right."" Later, Carolyn wondered how Screenwise got her phone number. She decided the money was not worth it. Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, said the company does ""panel research to help better serve our users by learning more about people's media use on the web and elsewhere."" She added that the Screenwise panels ""are completely optional to join and we've invested significantly to ensure that panelists' security and privacy are protected."" Another reason Google might be having trouble getting enough participants could have to do with the name on the letter. It is signed, ""J. Michael Dennis, Ph.D."" Since that graduate degree is pointedly emphasized, some recipients are probably searching for Mr. Dennis on Google. They will quickly find that not only is he a questionnaire expert but that his dissertation was on ""The Politics of Kidney Transplantation."" Mr. Dennis told me he could not comment about his work for Google.

F.T.C. Suggests Privacy Guidelines for Mobile Apps,"WASHINGTON -- In a strong move to protect the privacy of Americans as they use the Internet on their smartphones and tablets, the Federal Trade Commission on Friday said the mobile industry should include a do-not-track feature in software and apps and take other steps to safeguard personal information. The staff report, which was approved by the commission, is not binding, but it is an indication of how seriously the agency is focused on mobile privacy. As if to emphasize that, the commission on Friday separately fined Path, a two-year-old social networking app, $800,000. It charged the company with violating federal privacy protections for children by collecting personal information on underage users, including almost everyone in users' address books.  Together the actions represent the government's heightened scrutiny of mobile devices, which for many Americans have become the primary way of gaining access to the Internet, rather than through a laptop or desktop computer. ''We've been looking at privacy issues for decades,'' said Jon Leibowitz, the F.T.C. chairman. ''But this is necessary because so much commerce is moving to mobile, and many of the rules and practices in the mobile space are sort of like the Wild West.'' The report lays out a clear picture of what sort of activities might bring a company under investigation -- like, for example, conveying the impression that an app will gather geolocation data only one time, when, in fact, it does so repeatedly. For companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and BlackBerry (formerly Research in Motion), the suggestions essentially carry the weight of policy. But the F.T.C. also has its sights on thousands of small businesses that create apps that smartphone users can download for a specific service. The introduction of the iPhone created a sort of gold rush among start-ups to create apps featuring games, music, maps and consumer services like shopping and social networking. ''This says if you're outside the recommended behavior, you're at a higher risk of enforcement action,'' said Mary Ellen Callahan, a partner at Jenner & Block and former chief privacy officer for the Department of Homeland Security. Morgan Reed, executive director of the Association for Competitive Technology, a trade group representing app developers, said that the organization generally supported the commission's report but that it had some concerns about what he called ''unintended consequences.'' If app stores are worried about their own liability over whether they have adequately checked the privacy protections of a mobile app they sell, they might err on the side of caution and not screen for privacy at all, he said. The federal recommendations follow a similar set of guidelines issued last month by the California attorney general, whose tips effectively set the standard for technology companies nationwide, given the state's huge consumer market. The trade commission and the Obama administration last year issued separate sets of recommendations for safeguarding consumers' online privacy, and the subject has attracted growing concern in Congress. But most of the focus to date, particularly with do-not-track policies, has been on Internet browsers commonly used at home but not on cellphones. Do-not-track features let users request that their footsteps not be followed as they move around online. The commission and the administration have begun to focus on mobile data privacy partly because smartphones let so many entities gain access to personal information, including wireless service providers, mobile operating system developers, handset manufacturers, app companies, analytics outfits and advertisers -- ''a degree unprecedented in the desktop environment,'' the report said. The activities of Path, a company in San Francisco, illustrate some of the F.T.C.'s concerns. The company developed a social networking app that allows people to keep an online journal about moments in their lives, including written entries, photos, music to which they are listening and their location. A user can share a journal with up to 150 people. The app has been installed more than 2.5 million times. The F.T.C. asserted that Path, without alerting its users, had engaged in deceptive practices because it routinely collected and stored information about the contacts in users' address books. The privacy policy that Path provided to consumers said it collected limited, mainly technical information about users' devices. In fact, the commission said, Path was collecting personal details including addresses, phone numbers, usernames for Facebook and Twitter, as well as dates of birth. The company also collected some of that information from users who, in signing up for the service, indicated that they were under age 13 without permission of their parents or disclosure of how it would use the information -- violations of rules adopted under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Path, without admitting or denying the accusations, agreed to pay an $800,000 fine and to comply with the children's privacy act, destroy already collected children's information, follow its own stated privacy policy and have its privacy efforts monitored by an outside party. In a statement posted on its Web site, Path said that ''there was a period of time where our system was not automatically rejecting people who indicated that they were under 13.'' But even before the F.T.C. contacted the company, Path said, ''we discovered and fixed this sign-up process qualification and took further action by suspending any underage accounts that had mistakenly been allowed to be created.'' The F.T.C. staff report, which was approved by a 4-to-0 vote, with one commission member not participating, recognized that steps were already being taken to adopt best practices for privacy protection. Among them is the creation of a group, Moms With Apps, which developed a badge icon to alert parents to the advertising and data-collection practices of apps aimed at children. Even before this report, ''the F.T.C. has not been meek,'' said Lisa J. Sotto, managing partner of Hunton & Williams in New York. ''They have brought a number of enforcement actions,'' she said. ''Those in the mobile ecosystem know they're in the regulators' sights.'' "
Q. and A. With Viviane Reding,"Viviane Reding, the vice president of the European Commission and the justice commissioner of the European Union, was asked to comment on trans-Atlantic data protection issues for the Slipstream column by Natasha Singer in the Sunday Business section. The following is Vice President Reding's full statement, sent on Jan. 31, 2013. Q. Why do Europeans feel so strongly about privacy and data rights? Why was it important for you to make data protection one of your signature issues? A. Data protection legislation has a long history in Europe: the European Union has had common rules to protect personal data since 1995. Personal data protection is a fundamental right for all Europeans -- this is inscribed in the E.U.'s Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The principles on which our laws are found are still valid. The main problem is that our rules predate the digital age and it became increasingly clear in recent years that they needed an update. Seventy-two percent of Europeans have told us in surveys that they are concerned about how companies use their personal data. They are especially worried about online privacy and this is one of the most frequent reasons why people don't buy goods and services online. People's trust in using digital services depends on whether they know that their data will be safely protected. We have a single trade area in Europe -- the Single Market with 500 million potential customers -- and we need strong, clear and uniform data protection rules for Europe's digital single market. That is why I have proposed a root and branch reform of the E.U.'s data protection rules -- currently under discussion in the European Parliament and the Council of the E.U. -- that will both protect citizens' rights and facilitate business in the digital age. Until recently, there was a common belief that the E.U. and U.S. have different approaches on privacy and that it would be difficult to work together. This can no longer be argued in such simple terms. In March 2011, the White House announced that it is working with Congress to produce ''a privacy bill of rights.'' This development -- which is much welcomed in Europe -- shows that we have much in common. Convergence is springing up and synergies are possible. Strong laws on both sides of the Atlantic would be good for trans-Atlantic cooperation. I hope my proposal will be the E.U. foundation of a data bridge that will link the U.S. and Europe. It's better to have steady footing on a bridge than to worry about the tide in a harbor. Q. What is your view about the differences in data protection offered by the proposed European data protection regulation and by the U.S. sectoral/self-regulatory system? A. The self-regulatory approach may have its benefits but it also has its limits. U.S. lawmakers are increasingly realizing this. There have been several attempts in the U.S. to develop a regulatory approach. Most recently, Senators Kerry and McCain proposed a bipartisan legislative initiative, and last year the White House announced baseline consumer privacy legislation. There have also been repeated calls from U.S. consumer associations and the Federal Trade Commission in favor of such legislation. I will pay close attention to the debate across the Atlantic and look forward to seeing what the fruits of these initiatives will be. I believe that not everything can be left to the good will of industry. The interests of industry and consumers may be quite different. Online giants collect personal information about us for their business purposes while we are becoming more and more concerned about the use of this data. The issue of confidence and trust in online services is not only a concern in Europe: a new U.S. survey has just shown that nearly half (45 percent) of U.S. citizens feel that they have little or no control over the personal information companies gather while they are browsing the Web or using online services such as photo sharing, travel or gaming. Twenty-one percent of citizens have even stopped using these online services because of data protection concerns. I believe that policy makers need to provide a solution. It is important both for consumers and businesses. Adopting legislation in this area does not mean that businesses will not be able to come up with their own self-regulatory initiatives. For instance, our proposed law foresees voluntary codes of conduct. The main difference with the U.S. system is that in Europe, such codes of conduct have a strong backbone -- they must be in line with our data protection legislation. This anchor in law is essential for the codes to be effective and inspire trust. Q. What is your view of the American efforts to influence the proposed European data protection regulation and directive? Once the regulation is enacted, what impact do you think it will have on data protections in countries outside of the European Union? A. Online privacy and personal data protection are global challenges and we are not the only ones grappling with these issues. We have had a high level of interest from across the Atlantic, but I would add that many other countries and regions are also following closely what we are doing on data protection in Europe. Europe is the largest economy in the world and we have close trading relationships with other parts of the world. But let me be clear: we are first and foremost making rules for European citizens and European businesses. This is my mandate as Europe's justice commissioner. This does not mean Europe's data protection rules will not have an impact elsewhere. Indeed, the proposed E.U. data protection law will be a real market-opener for companies outside Europe which want to do business on our single market. It will cut costs and increase legal certainty by replacing the current patchwork of laws in Europe with a single uniform set of rules for all 27 European Union countries. By the way, a similar issue exists in the U.S. Take the definition of ''personal information.'' In Florida, not a single law defines the term, but in Arizona there are five such laws. I believe a single rule is better for business. And we are cutting red tape by introducing a one-stop shop for businesses to deal with regulators. In the future, companies will only have to deal with the data protection authorities in the E.U. country in which they are based: one interlocutor, not 27. We have calculated that the revamped rules can save companies up to $3 billion per year because they will not need to familiarize themselves and comply with 27 different national laws if they want to do business in Europe. Another important issue that our proposed rules address and which matters for countries outside Europe is the issue of international data transfers. The new E.U. data protection rules will improve the current system of binding corporate rules to make these types of exchanges less burdensome and more secure. And under the new legislation the adequacy procedure will better specify the criteria and requirements for assessing the level of data protection in a third country or an international organization. Rules which recognize the adequacy of data protection standards make life easier for businesses by providing legal certainty in their international operations. There are benefits for the economy and trade. "
Trying Passenger Patience,"One traveler criticized the body scanners at airport checkpoints as ''an overpriced technology that provides a false sense of security and a real sense of intrusion into our personal lives.'' A second called the machines a ''disgrace,'' requiring travelers to stand ''with arms in the air and hands overhead, for screening our entire bodies each time we fly.'' A third said simply, ''You have NOT made me feel safer!'' The Transportation Security Administration, under a court order issued nearly two years ago, has finally been soliciting public comments about its use of body scanners and pat-downs at airports. More than 500 people have offered their thoughts -- overwhelmingly negative -- so far. The deadline for submitting comments is June 24. The security agency was required by federal law to seek public comment before using the scanners for primary screening at airport checkpoints.  In 2010, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group, sued to block the use of body scanners, arguing that the machines violated travelers' constitutional rights. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in a ruling in 2011, did not find the checkpoint technology unlawful, but it ordered the T.S.A. to ''act promptly'' to seek public input, noting that the ''privacy, safety and efficacy'' of the body scanners ''no doubt would have been the subject of many comments had the T.S.A. seen fit to solicit comments.'' The feedback filed so far addresses precisely those topics, with a large majority of respondents objecting to the technology. (The instructions and copies of the submissions filed so far are available at regulations.gov. Search for TSA-2013-0004.) But it is not clear how this input will affect airport screening procedures, since more than 800 of these machines are already being used at 200 domestic airports. ''That's sort of an open question,'' said Ginger McCall, director of the privacy center's Open Government Project. ''We have seen some agencies close the notice and comment period and issue the rule the same day, which means they're not really taking public comments into account.'' David Castelveter, a T.S.A. spokesman, said the agency would analyze the comments once they were all collected. Mr. Castelveter added that the privacy concerns raised by many passengers when the scanners were introduced had already been addressed. The agency has added software privacy filters to all of the millimeter wave scanners so screeners see only an outline of the passenger being scanned -- not the more graphic body image the machines originally produced. Since the backscatter X-ray machines could not be updated with a similar software filter to comply with a Congressional mandate, they are being removed from airports by June 1, easing another major concern: the potential health risks of widespread exposure to even low-level radiation. Even so, privacy concerns are among the most frequently cited issues in the comments submitted so far, particularly among passengers who choose not to be scanned and must submit to a pat-down instead. ''I opt out of the scanners, and it's not a comfortable experience,'' Allison Schauer said in a telephone interview after she filed comments on the government site. ''There is no patting -- they run their hands along every part of you.'' In her written comments, Ms. Schauer criticized the machines' false alarm rate, their impact on travelers with physical limitations and the longer wait times for those who opt for pat-downs. She also questioned the machines' effectiveness, a subject many other commenters raised. While the T.S.A. has declined to publicly release the results of tests that would indicate how well the scanners detect explosives and other threats that could bring down an aircraft, lawmakers who have seen some of these performance results have called them disappointing. And during a hearing last week held by the House Subcommittee on Transportation Security, the growing cost of airport screening was a central concern. President Obama's 2014 budget request includes $7.4 billion for the T.S.A., and a proposal to increase the aviation security fee travelers pay to $5 per one-way trip. The fee is currently $2.50 per flight segment, so it would double for a trip without a connection. Researchers have been pressing this issue as well, pointing out that with any investment intended to save lives, standard risk analysis would determine if the measure is cost-effective, not just whether it is effective. ''The question is, Will it reduce the risk of a terrorist attack enough to justify the cost?'' said John Mueller, a political-science professor at Ohio State University. Professor Mueller and Mark Stewart, an engineering professor at the University of Newcastle in Australia, have written multiple papers about balancing the costs and benefits of aviation security, and said they planned to file comments summarizing their research. Their analysis, published in The Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management in 2011, found that the body scanners would have to prevent a terrorist attack once every two years to justify the cost to buy and operate the machines at every checkpoint in the United States. Researchers in other fields have also looked at this issue. G. Stuart Mendenhall and Mark Schmidhofer, both cardiologists who teach at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, recently published an article, ''Screening Tests for Terrorism,'' in the journal Regulation, which they said they planned to submit. The article evaluates airport screening measures based on principles used by the medical community to decide whom to test for diseases -- and how much to spend to detect a rare condition. ''There is a correlation between the detection of disease and the detection of a terrorist,'' Dr. Mendenhall said. ''The same approaches can be useful and valid.'' Those approaches, he said, include making sure that the test does not miss or overdiagnose whatever it is intended to detect, that the results are reliable (with repeatable results), and that it is cost-effective and accepted by the population being examined. Dr. Mendenhall said he was motivated to write the paper after being interviewed by a behavior detection officer in the security line at Logan Airport in Boston. The officer asked how he had enjoyed visiting Boston and misinterpreted Dr. Mendenhall's dour response: he had traveled to the city for a funeral. That experience, he said, was the catalyst for exploring how a screening measure to detect terrorist intent -- a rare occurrence -- compares with tests doctors use to diagnose a rare medical condition. ''The test has to be really good before you start applying it to a lot of people and act on the results,'' Dr. Mendenhall said. ''Any sort of invasive or secondary screening must be reserved for high-risk individuals.'' "
Updating an E-Mail Law From the Last Century,"Steven Warshak, a Cincinnati businessman who built an empire selling male sexual enhancement drugs, was convicted of wire fraud several years ago, based in large part on his e-mail correspondence, which authorities had extracted via a subpoena under a 1986 law governing electronic privacy. But a federal appeals court in Ohio later found that the government had violated Mr. Warshak's constitutional right to privacy. The court said investigators should have convinced a judge that there was probable cause and obtained a search warrant, as though his messages had been stashed in a desk drawer. Although the court let the conviction stand, the case highlighted the conflicting legal rules that govern electronic privacy. Congress is now set to clarify those rules, bringing that quarter-century-old law, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, or E.C.P.A., in line with the Internet age. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will start deliberating a measure that would require the government to get a search warrant, issued by a judge, to gain access to personal e-mails and all other electronic content held by a third-party service provider.  The current statute requires a warrant for e-mails that are less than six months old. But it lets the authorities gain access to older communications -- or bizarrely, e-mails that have already been opened -- with just a subpoena and no judicial review. The law governs the privacy of practically everything entrusted to the Internet -- family photos stored with a Web service, journal entries kept online, company documents uploaded to the cloud, and the flurry of e-mails exchanged every day. The problem is that it was written when the cloud was just vapor in the sky. Silicon Valley companies as well as advocacy groups from the political left and right have been lobbying for change for many years, and reform legislation seems to be gaining broad political support. Even the Justice Department appears to have approved one major change: requiring law enforcement to get a search warrant for all kinds of electronic content, no matter how long it has been in electronic storage or what exactly electronic storage means. ''Changing the law has become more of an imperative because of the growth of cloud computing, because everyone including members of Congress are storing sensitive info with third-party providers and they want it to be protected,'' said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology, which is financed partly by Silicon Valley companies and which is part of a coalition pushing for reform. ''The technology is advancing and people realize the law has to keep pace.'' Updating the bill could have a broader impact on civil cases as well, clarifying who can gain access to e-mails, photos and Facebook posts in corporate litigation and divorce court. And it could lay out clearer rules for government agencies like the Internal Revenue Service to follow to gain access to private citizens' e-mails. The agency told Congress recently that it seeks search warrants before reading taxpayer e-mails, though its written policy says otherwise, according to an information request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. Courts across the country, apparently baffled by how to apply the existing law, which applies to content held in ''electronic storage,'' have ruled in sometimes contradictory ways over the privacy of electronic material in both civil and criminal cases. In one prominent case, Lee Jennings sued a relative of his wife who had broken into his Yahoo account and ferreted out e-mails describing an extramarital affair that were later used as incriminating evidence in divorce proceedings. Mr. Jennings claimed a violation of his privacy under the electronic privacy act, but the highest court in his home state of South Carolina held that his e-mails, which sat on Yahoo's servers, were not held in ''electronic storage,'' and therefore were not covered by the statute. A federal court in California years earlier had ruled differently in another case, interpreting ''electronic storage'' far more broadly. Mr. Jennings' lawyer, Neal K. Katyal, a former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, asked the Supreme Court to reconcile the dueling interpretations. The court declined to hear the case this month, effectively leaving it to Congress to clarify the law. Although the appeals court ruling in the Warshak criminal case is binding only in the Sixth Circuit, it has since become the default legal threshold for many Web companies. Facebook says it turns over content created by users -- pictures, posts, messages -- only after it is served with a search warrant, though a subpoena suffices for basic subscriber information, including a user's name and e-mail address. Twitter, too, says ''requests for contents of communication require a U.S. search warrant,'' and informs users when it receives a request for information from a government agency. Microsoft, which operates e-mail and cloud storage services, follows a similar practice, insisting on a search warrant for ''content,'' including documents, photos, e-mail and instant messages. With a subpoena, the company can divulge a user's Internet Protocol record, though, which can be used to establish a person's location. ''The law is so old it doesn't account for how we have turned into a digital society,'' said Bryan Schilling, a lawyer at Microsoft. He offered an offline analogy: ''If somebody had a storage unit, law enforcement would be required to get a search warrant,'' he said. ''It's the same thing now, as we store more and more of our content in the cloud, consumer or enterprise.'' The original sponsor of the 1986 law, Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, has called its overhaul his top priority for the year. He and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, have introduced a measure requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant for all electronic content, including e-mails, regardless of how old they are. That overhaul is backed by an unlikely coalition. Amazon and Google, which offer cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, are lobbying for the change, along with start-ups like Evernote and Tumblr, which operate modern-day private diaries. They have joined with advocacy groups as diverse as the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans for Tax Reform. The issue of e-mail privacy received the greatest attention last year, when Gen. David H. Petraeus, the former director of the C.I.A., resigned after an inquiry into his e-mail correspondence turned up evidence of an extramarital affair. He and his biographer, Paula Broadwell, had exchanged amorous correspondence in a ''draft'' folder of a shared Gmail account, apparently to elude detection. Those draft messages, because they had not been transmitted across the Internet, could have been viewed by federal authorities with nothing more than a subpoena, according to current law. "
Firms Brace for New European Data Privacy Law,"BERLIN -- The effort in Europe to adopt the world's strongest data protection law has drawn the attention of dozens of lobbyists from U.S. technology and advertising companies. Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon and I.B.M., individually and through industry groups, have all sought to actively participate in a legislative process that could give half a billion consumers the right to withhold basic personal details while using the Web, putting a major crimp in the financial model that makes those business run. On Monday, their European counterparts showed up in force at a conference in Berlin to discuss the potential law, which is expected to come to a vote sometime next year. Representatives from European Aeronautics Defense & Space, BMW, Daimler and Rovio Entertainment, the creator of mobile apps like Angry Birds, filled a hotel meeting room and tried to figure out how new rules would affect them.  Even nontech companies like UBS, the Swiss bank, were among the 70 attendees at the Pullman Hotel Scheizerhof near the Tiergarten central park, as the new regulations are expected to affect virtually every type of business. The effort to create strict new online privacy protections in Europe is motivated by a desire to rein in the data use of social media companies like Google and Facebook, said Ian Walden, a professor of information and communications law at the University of London and a speaker at the conference. ''But the problem is this proposal is going to create a whole new layer of regulation for the vast majority of businesses that have nothing to do with social media,'' he said. ''They are going to see their compliance loads increase greatly with very little benefit.'' The measures would prohibit the use of a range of standard Web tracking and profiling practices that companies use to produce targeted advertising, unless consumers gave their explicit prior consent. The bill would also grant European consumers a fundamental new right: data portability, or the right to easily transfer an individual's posts, photographs and video from one online service site to another. The measures, as well as the creation of an E.U.-wide data privacy regulator, were originally proposed last year by Viviane Reding, the European justice commissioner. They are now contained in a bill sponsored by Jan Philipp Albrecht, a member of the European Parliament from Hanover. But the fate of the bill, meant to revise an 18-year-old statute, remains murky. The lead parliamentary committee for the bill is struggling to schedule more than 3,000 amendments to the proposal and has already pushed back a vote from the end of this month until June. Negotiators in the upper house of Parliament are at odds over basic concepts, like the requirement for businesses to obtain prior consent before collecting Web data and proposed penalties for violators, which would be set at up to 2 percent of a company's annual sales. ''I think at this point, there will be a set of new rules, they will be uniform, and they will raise the level of data protection from where it is now,'' said Thomas Lehnert, the director of data protection for EADS Deutschland, who participated in the conference. EADS, which employs eight full-time data protection officers in 17 countries, may have to hire many more such officers in almost all of its jurisdictions, he said. ''I think we are talking about a multiple of what we have now,'' Mr. Lehnert said. U.S. interest in the European deliberations remains significant. About a third of the data-protection officials attending the conference were representatives of U.S.-based companies. Exxon Mobil, Aon, Amway and Procter & Gamble were present, as were the global law firms of Hogan Lovells, Taylor Wessing and Latham & Watkins. Other countries are watching as well. Lawmakers in South Africa are in the final stages of completing a six-year effort to create the country's first comprehensive data protection laws, which will be tailored to the new E.U. rules, said Robby Coelho, a lawyer at Webber Wentzel, a law firm in Johannesburg. ''South Africa wants to have internationally recognized data protection standards to attract businesses to the country,'' Mr. Coelho said. Likewise in the Middle East, the overseers of international free trade zones in Qatar and Dubai plan to adopt data protection laws that mirror European rules, said Justin Cornish, a lawyer at Latham & Watkins in Dubai, who also attended the Berlin conference. ''There is an expectation that data protection laws around the world are going to become more stringent, and Europe is leading the way,'' Mr. Cornish said. "
At the Airport: Scanner or Pat-Down?,"To the Editor: Many travelers share the concerns of Nathaniel Rich (''Showdown at the Airport Body Scanner,'' Sunday Review, May 26). The Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, pursued a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security to establish that all air travelers have the right to opt out of airport body scanners. As a result of the lawsuit, the Transportation Security Administration is also required to accept public comments on the decision to make body scanners the primary screening technique in United States airports. The agency will accept comments until June 23.  EPIC is urging the public to express its views on the airport screening program. The United States operates one of the most intrusive passenger screening systems in the world. Yet continuing concerns about privacy, health and effectiveness remain largely unanswered. MARC ROTENBERG President, Electronic Privacy Information Center Washington, May 27, 2013 To the Editor: Like Nathaniel Rich, many transportation security officers are concerned about their possible exposure to radiation from the equipment that the Transportation Security Administration uses to screen passengers. As the officers' representative, we have pressed for a comprehensive radiation protection program that would include exposure monitoring and training on radiation and its possible health effects. The agency has agreed only to a pilot study for part of the work force. Our position is that all officers should be issued dosimeters to monitor radiation exposure. Most of the public's concern with T.S.A.'s screening equipment has been focused on privacy issues. If more Americans voiced concern about radiation exposure and put pressure on their elected officials, the agency might be forced to discontinue its use of the machines in favor of safer technologies. That would reduce the risk for both the public and the workers. J. DAVID COX Sr. National President, American Federation of Government Employees Washington, May 28, 2013 To the Editor: Nathaniel Rich chooses to shun airport body scanners in favor of what he deems offensive pat-downs. Forgive me if I fail to sympathize with his predicament. I am a federal judge. By virtue of my office, I can read (and have read) highly sensitive national security materials and presided at the trial of terrorist suspects. I could not have done these things -- indeed, I could not have been confirmed to my office -- if I represented a threat to anyone. No matter; I suffer from the crime of having artificial knees. Until total body scanners arrived at airports, every time I flew I was subjected to humiliating and time-consuming pat-downs. They are indeed as intrusive as Mr. Rich describes. But I, unlike Mr. Rich, had no choice in the matter -- no way to protest, no ''opt out'' -- except to opt out of flying. What might have helped me avoid a groping was the quicker, cheaper and far less offensive technique of wanding; one quick pass would have revealed exactly where the metal was and why I set off the detector. Sadly, wanding has been abolished except to clear a Sikh's turban or other ''non-form-fitting headwear.'' I and thousands like me are delighted and grateful that we no longer have to suffer ritually the indignity to which Mr. Rich submits voluntarily and -- in view of his acknowledgment that his fear of cancer is ''most likely baseless'' -- unnecessarily. Frankly, I would rather a T.S.A. agent look at my insides than touch my outsides. COLLEEN McMAHON New York, May 27, 2013 The writer is a United States district judge for the Southern District of New York. To the Editor: I, too, opt out of airport body scanners to avoid the possible health risks Nathaniel Rich noted, and request a public frisking instead. But I have experienced only courteous treatment from transportation security inspectors and a brief delay (less than five minutes). So I encourage all air travelers -- especially those with many decades of flying ahead of them -- also to opt out. Given what I have seen, one can do so frequently without encountering the hassles that Mr. Rich described. MARSHALL HOYLER Warren, R.I., May 26, 2013 To the Editor: I am just under 5 feet tall and weigh about 98 pounds. Like Nathaniel Rich, I have chosen to opt out of the airport scanners. During a recent trip, my ''frisker'' (I prefer to use the word ''groper'') identified a suspicious object on my torso. She called over the supervisor, who closely examined said torso area. The supervisor also identified the suspicious object; then she told her junior associate to allow me to proceed to my departure gate since the hard, pointed object was my rib. MARCIA ZALBOWITZ Schenectady, N.Y., May 26, 2013 "
"More Data On Privacy, But Picture Is No Clearer","SAN FRANCISCO -- Technology companies, the custodians of reams of personal data from hundreds of millions of people around the world, have been under fire after recent revelations that they secretly handed over customer information, including e-mails, in response to requests by the federal government made in the name of national security. Now, one by one, the companies are putting out data intended to reassure their users that the government gets information on just a tiny number of people. Over the weekend, Facebook and Microsoft released reports about the overall number of data requests they had received from United States law enforcement agencies. On Monday, Apple and Yahoo joined the chorus.  But rather than provide clarity, some of the disclosures have left many questions unanswered. Apple, for example, said that from Dec. 1, 2012, through May 31, 2013, it received between 4,000 and 5,000 requests for data, covering 9,000 to 10,000 accounts, from American law enforcement agencies. Facebook said it got 9,000 to 10,000 requests for information about its users, covering 18,000 to 19,000 user accounts, in the last six months of 2012. How many of those requests were from investigators seeking to sniff out the next terrorist? The companies said they were not allowed to say, although they noted that the requests were commonly related to things like local police investigations and searches for missing children. That continuing restriction prompted both Google and Twitter to say they would not publish similar data until they could separate national security requests from the rest. ''We still don't know what is allowed and how these programs are being implemented,'' said Amie Stepanovich, director of the Domestic Surveillance Project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit group. But the companies were under immense pressure to announce something. If customers do not trust that Facebook or Microsoft or Google will keep private data confidential, they could use those services far less, undermining the companies' business model. ''They've got to say to the consuming public that we care about your data, we're going to do everything we can to preserve your data, and absent a national security contingency, no one gets access to your data,'' said Adonis Hoffman, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, who has served as a legal adviser to both the government and the advertising industry. Pressing on the companies from the other side are the country's intelligence agencies, which prohibit companies from disclosing virtually anything about the requests for national security data without permission. ''The nature of these orders are that they themselves are secret,'' said one frustrated executive at a company involved in discussions with the government over disclosure issues. Despite a week of arduous negotiations since the first reports about the National Security Agency's seeking private data from nine major technology companies, the firms still cannot say much. ''The government will only authorize us to communicate about these numbers in aggregate, and as a range,'' Facebook wrote when it posted its data late Friday night. Still, for tech companies that had never before released a transparency report, like Facebook and Apple, the data shed some light on their practices. Apple, for example, noted in its report that it never gives the government copies of electronic conversations that take place over iMessage and FaceTime because they are protected by encryption that even Apple cannot break. ''Similarly, we do not store data related to customers' location, Map searches or Siri requests in any identifiable form,'' the company said. Google and Twitter, which had previously released transparency reports, said that lumping all law enforcement requests together, like Apple and the others did over the weekend, would be even less transparent. Microsoft, which put out its first transparency report in March, decided to disclose the aggregate numbers but said it was pressing for further disclosure. Google, which published its first transparency report in 2010, has been the most aggressive in pushing for more disclosure. In March, it began breaking out data on one type of government request -- National Security Letters, which request information on Americans -- saying it had received 0 to 999 requests. Permission to disclose that came after more than a year of negotiations with the government, and Google had been seeking permission to publish data on the other major type of national security request -- information on foreigners demanded under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- even before news of Prism, the government's surveillance program, broke, according to a person briefed on those discussions. It is still in talks to try to publish more detailed data, the person said. By pushing to be able to publish more data on national security requests, the companies were hoping to shift the debate from the data exchange between the tech companies and the government to how the government can be more transparent about it. Still, even if the government gives permission to break out FISA requests as a separate data point, the numbers are unlikely to tell the whole story. For every formal FISA request the government makes, intelligence agents are able to add names and additional search queries to that request for up to a year afterward, so the amount of data requested could be much higher. Also, when the government gave Google and Microsoft permission to publish the number of national security letters they receive, it required them to publish the numbers in increments of 1,000, instead of the exact number, and would most likely do the same for FISA requests. "
Privacy Group to Ask Supreme Court to Stop N.S.A.'s Phone Spying Program,"WASHINGTON -- A privacy rights group plans to file an emergency petition with the Supreme Court on Monday asking it to stop the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program that collects the telephone records of millions of Americans. The group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, says it is taking the extraordinary legal step of going directly to the Supreme Court because the sweeping collection of the phone records of American citizens has created ''exceptional circumstances'' that only the nation's highest court can address.  The group, based in Washington, also said it was taking its case to the Supreme Court because it could not challenge the legality of the N.S.A. program at the secret court that approved it, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, known as the FISA court, and because lower federal courts did not have the authority to review the secret court's orders. In its petition, the group said the FISA court had ''exceeded its statutory jurisdiction when it ordered production of millions of domestic telephone records that cannot plausibly be relevant to an authorized investigation.'' The suit is the latest in a series of legal challenges to the N.S.A.'s domestic spying operations that have been filed over the past month after disclosures by a former N.S.A. contractor, Edward J. Snowden. Based on a document leaked by Mr. Snowden, The Guardian revealed early last month that the FISA court had issued an order in April directing Verizon Business Network Services to turn over all of the telephone records for its customers to the N.S.A. The secret court order was also published by The Guardian. Within days of the disclosure of the court order, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit in federal court in New York. Separately, Larry Klayman, a conservative lawyer who runs a group called Freedom Watch, filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court in Washington on behalf of Verizon customers. Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said his group's lawsuit would be the first to directly challenge the legal authority of the FISA court to approve the phone records' collection under the Patriot Act. Alan Butler, a lawyer for the group, said the judge ''lacked the authority to require production of all domestic call detail records.'' He noted that the Patriot Act provision cited by the FISA court required that the business records produced be ''relevant'' to an authorized national security investigation. ''It is simply implausible that all call detail records are relevant,'' Mr. Butler said. The new challenges come after the failure of a legal campaign against the N.S.A.'s domestic spying operations during the administration of President George W. Bush. A series of lawsuits were brought against an N.S.A. program of wiretapping without warrants soon after the existence of the program was revealed by The New York Times in December 2005. Those lawsuits were against the telecommunications companies that cooperated with the N.S.A. program, but Congress later gave the companies retroactive legal immunity when it overhauled the nation's national security wiretapping law in 2008. Those lawsuits also suffered in federal courts because it was difficult for the plaintiffs to prove that they had actually been spied upon by the N.S.A., since the domestic spying operations were secret and the courts refused to force the government to release any documents to reveal the targets of the surveillance. But the new lawsuits benefit from the publication of the secret court order concerning Verizon, providing evidence that the records of Verizon customers have been collected. The American Civil Liberties Union, in its lawsuit, argues that it has legal standing to bring its case because the group is a Verizon customer. "
Sore Feelings as U.S. and Europe Begin Trade Talks,"WASHINGTON -- Negotiations over a trade deal encompassing nearly half the global economy formally kicked off on Monday, despite concerns that the United States has been spying on its European allies. European officials have called the potential free trade agreement with the United States a ''once-in-a-generation prize,'' with the prospect of adding hundreds of billions of dollars in yearly growth and thousands of jobs to the still-lagging European and American economies. But big deals come with big stakes, and analysts expect months of intense negotiations as officials rush to complete a comprehensive agreement -- under the title of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership -- before a deadline of the end of 2014.  Companies and countries have started maneuvering in an effort to broker special carve-outs, exclusions or inclusions. Sensitive issues like agricultural policy, airline rights, data privacy and intellectual property are likely to face serious headwinds. Michael Froman, the United States trade representative, urged those taking part in the talks here to ''think outside of the box as necessary to make progress.'' He added both sides were entering the talks ''with eyes wide open'' but with the knowledge that ''there is strong political will at the highest levels on both sides of the Atlantic determined to stay focused and get this done on one tank of gas.'' Despite the push on both sides of the Atlantic, reports that the United States' National Security Agency has been secretly tracking European diplomatic offices in Washington overshadowed the start of the talks. In recent weeks, several European leaders expressed outrage over the reports, which were based on information supplied by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden, who remains in legal limbo in a Moscow airport. France, in a show of deep discontent, called for postponement of the trade talks. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany criticized American espionage agencies for ''cold war'' tactics. Last week, the European Parliament voted to start an investigation into the matter. Parallel negotiations on security and surveillance concerns started Monday as well, covering ''data protection and privacy rights of E.U. citizens,'' European officials said in a statement. Even so, the interlinked economies -- still suffering from low growth rates and high unemployment in the wake of the recession -- desperately need a shot in the arm. The International Monetary Fund predicts that the euro zone will contract again this year, with the broader European Union scarcely growing. The outlook is better in the United States, but not much; the fund expects modest growth of about 1.9 percent. ''We are convinced that this trade agreement will result in more jobs and more growth -- and that will help to get us out of the economic crisis,'' Karel de Gucht, the European trade commissioner, said at a news conference on Monday. ''That would be good news for Europe, but also a very good message for the whole world economy.'' One major study by the London-based Center for Economic Policy Research found that a comprehensive trade and investment deal could increase the European economy by about 119 billion euros, or $150 billion a year, and the American economy by an annual $122 billion. Households are expected to benefit, too. An average family of four in the European Union might see an additional 545 euros in disposable income, the study found. An American family might benefit by about $841. ''This is a once-in-a-generation prize, and we are determined to seize it,'' David Cameron, the British prime minister, said last month at a meeting with President Obama and other leaders at the Group of 8 summit meeting in Northern Ireland. The similarity of the American and European work forces, corporate structures and legal systems -- and the depth and breadth of the existing ties between the two economies -- have eased the way for an ambitious deal on tariffs, regulations and other issues. But entrenched interests have started lobbying in earnest behind the scenes. For instance, France has pushed to retain its subsidies for its domestic film industry. And farm and food safety standards are expected to be a major sticking point in the negotiations. Genetically modified crops, which Europe largely abhors and which the United States produces billions of dollars' worth a year, are just one issue. On Monday, public interest groups also raised concerns that the negotiations would weaken consumer protection standards, and that corporate interests were too strong. ''We are highly skeptical that an agreement focused on regulatory harmonization' will serve consumer interests, workers' rights, the environment, and other areas of public interest,'' said a large coalition of American and European consumer groups in a statement. ''It could lead to lower standards and regulatory ceilings instead of floors,'' the statement said. The coalition called for negotiating texts to be released to the public. But officials have put in months of legwork on the negotiations, and they were optimistic as the deal talks formally began. ''We will work hard to get a result,'' said Mr. De Gucht, the European trade commissioner. ''We will of course meet a lot of problems and stumbling stones, but if we reach an agreement, it would be a historic one.'' "
German Chancellor Urges European Union to Tighten Rules for Internet Privacy,"PARIS -- Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is calling for the European Union to adopt legislation requiring Internet companies to disclose what information about users they store and to whom they provide it. Ms. Merkel's remarks, in a television interview on Sunday night, reflected the anger throughout much of Europe, including Germany, over recent accounts of government surveillance by the United States National Security Agency. Those accounts, in government documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor, included the agency's compilation of logs of virtually all telephone calls in the United States and its collection of e-mails of foreigners from the major American Internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple and Skype. Those companies have already begun aggressive lobbying campaigns to stop or dilute tighter privacy rules, which they say would interfere with their business models and decrease profits and growth. The companies' efforts are, in turn, supported by countries like England and Ireland that fear that such restrictions would hamper economic recovery.  Unlike many citizens in the United States, whose desire to prevent the kind of widespread terrorist attacks like those of Sept. 11, 2001, often trumps their concerns about privacy rights and government surveillance, Germans have experienced the corruption of those rights under the Nazis and later the Communist government of East Germany, making them far more sensitive to the issue. Until now, though, Germany has been slow to back an aggressive privacy initiative across Europe partly because the country's laws are among the tightest in the bloc. Ms. Merkel said she now believed that only a broader pact could be effective. ''That has to be part of such a data privacy agreement because we have great regulation for Germany, but if Facebook is registered in Ireland, then it falls under Irish jurisdiction,'' she said. ''Consequently we need a common European agreement.'' Human rights groups in Germany and Austria, which has similarly strict rules guarding private information, have taken on the Internet giants over Facebook's default settings on sharing personal data and Google's scooping up of private information while mapping out German cities for its Street View service. ''What actually happens with data when they leave Germany to servers outside of the country, or Europe, where they fall under the jurisdiction of completely different regulations?'' Ms. Merkel asked in the interview on Sunday with the public broadcast network ARD. She pointed out that existing international accords on privacy protection were drawn up decades before the digital era, and she said she would meet in the coming days with her interior and justice ministers to draw up proposed regulations on data privacy that could apply across the entire 28-nation bloc. Companies contacted by e-mail, including Google and Microsoft, did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Ms. Merkel's remarks. ''We're still investigating what she said, and in what context she said it,'' said Lisa Randles, a spokeswoman for BSA, an alliance of software companies, including Apple and Microsoft The European Union's justice commissioner, Viviane Reding, who originally proposed rules overhauling and updating the bloc's privacy standards in early 2012, praised ''this commitment of Chancellor Merkel to strong and uniform E.U. data protection rules'' in a statement on Monday in Brussels. The N.S.A. revelations have placed an added political strain on Ms. Merkel, who polls suggest remains in a strong position before German elections in September but who is under increasing attack from opposition parties trying to use the matter to undercut her popularity. ''The question is whether this is part of election campaign tactics or something with real substance,'' Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German member of the European Parliament who is the main sponsor of the legislation, said in a telephone interview on Monday. The legislation needs the Parliament's approval to take effect. Opposition parties have accused Ms. Merkel's government of being too deferential to the United States over the issues of data privacy and government surveillance, and of allowing German intelligence agencies to be complicit in the American programs. Peer Steinbrück, the chancellor's main rival in the elections, said in an interview published Sunday in the newspaper Bild am Sonntag that she had broken her oath of office by failing in her duties to protect the German people, including their personal data. ''As chancellor, Ms. Merkel swore to prevent harm to the German people,'' Mr. Steinbrück said. In Brussels, Ms. Reding, the bloc's justice commissioner, suggested that the first real opportunity for countries like Germany to push forward on any proposed legislation would be in October, at a summit meeting in Brussels, where the bloc's leaders should ''address this matter and speed up the work.'' Ms. Reding said the goal should be to reach an agreement at the European Union level by next spring, before elections for the European Parliament. But Peter Hustinx, the European data protection supervisor, warned last month that the bloc's efforts could be stalled by ''exceptional'' lobbying by Internet companies and by countries opposed to stronger data privacy rules. At their meeting last month, ministers began introducing more business-friendly elements into the proposals, including allowing regulators to scrutinize how companies use personal data only in cases of risks to individuals, including identity theft or discrimination. The ministers debated a proposal that would allow companies to obtain ''unambiguous'' consent, which is considered a lower legal threshold than the ''explicit'' consent now required from users whose personal data they collect and process. Mr. Albrecht, the German European Parliament member, said the public outcry over surveillance by government and major Internet companies had already made lobbying in Europe harder for the technology industry. ''Companies cannot just say, 'We don't have anything to do with surveillance or misuse of data,' because in fact they are at the core of it,'' Mr. Albrecht said. ''So if they engage in calling for less strict standards, they will lose trust in their services.'' "
A Black Box for Car Crashes,"When Timothy P. Murray crashed his government-issued Ford Crown Victoria in 2011, he was fortunate, as car accidents go. Mr. Murray, then the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, was not seriously hurt, and he told the police he was wearing a seat belt and was not speeding. But a different story soon emerged. Mr. Murray was driving over 100 miles an hour and was not wearing a seat belt, according to the computer in his car that tracks certain actions. He was given a $555 ticket; he later said he had fallen asleep. The case put Mr. Murray at the center of a growing debate over a little-known but increasingly important piece of equipment buried deep inside a car: the event data recorder, more commonly known as the black box. About 96 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States have the boxes, and in September 2014, if the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has its way, all will have them.  The boxes have long been used by car companies to assess the performance of their vehicles. But data stored in the devices is increasingly being used to identify safety problems in cars and as evidence in traffic accidents and criminal cases. And the trove of data inside the boxes has raised privacy concerns, including questions about who owns the information, and what it can be used for, even as critics have raised questions about its reliability. To federal regulators, law enforcement authorities and insurance companies, the data is an indispensable tool to investigate crashes. The black boxes ''provide critical safety information that might not otherwise be available to N.H.T.S.A. to evaluate what happened during a crash -- and what future steps could be taken to save lives and prevent injuries,'' David L. Strickland, the safety agency's administrator, said in a statement. But to consumer advocates, the data is only the latest example of governments and companies having too much access to private information. Once gathered, they say, the data can be used against car owners, to find fault in accidents or in criminal investigations. ''These cars are equipped with computers that collect massive amounts of data,'' said Khaliah Barnes of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based consumer group. ''Without protections, it can lead to all kinds of abuse.'' What's more, consumer advocates say, government officials have yet to provide consistent guidelines on how the data should be used. ''There are no clear standards that say, this is a permissible use of the data and this is not,'' Ms. Barnes said. Fourteen states, including New York, have passed laws that say that, even though the data belongs to the vehicle's owner, law enforcement officials and those involved in civil litigation can gain access to the black boxes with a court order. In these states, lawyers may subpoena the data for criminal investigations and civil lawsuits, making the information accessible to third parties, including law enforcement or insurance companies that could cancel a driver's policy or raise a driver's premium based on the recorder's data. In Mr. Murray's case, a court order was not required to release the data to investigators. Massachusetts is not among the states to pass a law governing access to the data. Asked about the case, Mr. Murray, who did not contest the ticket and who resigned as lieutenant governor in June to become head of the Chamber of Commerce in Worcester, Mass., declined to comment. Current regulations require that the presence of the black box be disclosed in the owner's manual. But the vast majority of drivers who do not read the manual thoroughly may not know that their vehicle can capture and record their speed, brake position, seat belt use and other data each time they get behind the wheel. Unlike the black boxes on airplanes, which continually record data including audio and system performance, the cars' recorders capture only the few seconds surrounding a crash or air bag deployment. A separate device extracts the data, which is then analyzed through computer software. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a Washington-based trade association that represents 12 automakers including General Motors and Chrysler, said it supported the mandate because the recorders helped to monitor passenger safety. ''Event data recorders help our engineers and researchers understand how cars perform in the real world, and one of our priorities for E.D.R.'s continues to be preserving consumer privacy,'' said Wade Newton, a spokesman for the trade association. ''Automakers don't access E.D.R. data without consumer permission, and we believe that any government requirements to install E.D.R.'s on all vehicles must include steps to protect consumer privacy.'' Beyond the privacy concerns, though, critics have questioned the data's reliability. In 2009, Anthony Niemeyer died after crashing a rented Ford Focus in Las Vegas. His widow, Kathryn, sued both Ford Motor and Hertz, contending that the air bag system failed to deploy. The black box, however, derailed Ms. Niemeyer's assertion that her husband had been traveling fast enough for the air bag to deploy. Though Ms. Niemeyer lost the suit last year, her lawyer, Daniel T. Ryan of St. Louis, was successful in excluding the black box data as evidence on the grounds that the device is not fully reliable. The judge in the case ruled that because an engineer working on behalf of the defense retrieved the data, the plaintiffs, who maintained there were errors, had no way to independently verify it. ''It's data that has not been shown to be absolutely reliable,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''It's not black and white.'' The origins of black boxes, which are the size of about two decks of cards and are situated under the center console, date to the 1990 model year, when General Motors introduced them to conduct quality studies. Since then, their use and the scope of the data they collect has expanded. The lack of standardization among manufacturers has made it difficult to extract the data, most notably during the investigations into the crashes caused by sudden, unintended acceleration in some Toyota vehicles. Until recently, crash investigators needed an automaker's proprietary reader as well as the expertise to analyze the data. The safety administration's regulations will help enable universal access to the data by using a commercially available tool. At the same time, police departments are receiving training on the new regulations. In Romulus, N.Y., last week, the Collision Safety Institute, a consultancy in San Diego, helped teach New York State Police investigators how to read the devices. But privacy advocates have expressed concern that the data collected will only grow to include a wider time frame and other elements like GPS and location-based services. ''The rabbit hole goes very deep when talking about this stuff,'' said Thomas Kowalick, an expert in event data recorders and a former co-chairman of the federal committee that set the standard for black boxes. Today, the boxes have spawned a cottage industry for YouTube videos on how to expunge the data. And Mr. Kowalick, seeing an opportunity, invented a device that safeguards access to in-vehicle electronics networks. It is controlled by the vehicle's owner with a key and is useful in the event of theft, he said. ''For most of the 100-year history of the car, it used to be 'he said, she said,' '' Mr. Kowalick said. ''That's no longer going to be the way.'' "
A Weak Agenda on Spying Reform,"President Obama, who seems to think the American people simply need some reassurance that their privacy rights are intact, proposed a series of measures on Friday that only tinker around the edges of the nation's abusive surveillance programs.  He said he wants ''greater oversight, greater transparency, and constraints'' on the mass collection of every American's phone records by the National Security Agency. He didn't specify what those constraints and oversight measures would be, only that he would work with Congress to develop them. But, in the meantime, the collection of records will continue as it has for years, gathering far more information than is necessary to fight terrorism. He said he wants an adversary to challenge the government's positions at the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a long-needed reform that would allow the court's federal judges to hear more than one point of view in approving targets and security policy. But if those arguments remain closed to the public -- and the president did not suggest otherwise -- then it will be impossible to evaluate whether the change has had any effect. At a minimum, he could have urged the court to release unclassified summaries of its opinions when possible. Finally, he announced that the N.S.A. would hire a civil liberties and privacy officer and create a Web site about its mission, and that a task force would review the nation's surveillance technologies. These measures, however, are unlikely to have a real effect on intelligence gathering. Fundamentally, Mr. Obama does not seem to understand that the nation needs to hear more than soothing words about the government's spying enterprise. He suggested that if ordinary people trusted the government not to abuse their privacy, they wouldn't mind the vast collection of phone and e-mail data. Bizarrely, he compared the need for transparency to showing his wife that he had done the dishes, rather than just telling her he had done so. Out-of-control surveillance is a bit more serious than kitchen chores. It is the existence of these programs that is the problem, not whether they are modestly transparent. As long as the N.S.A. believes it has the right to collect records of every phone call -- and the administration released a white paper Friday that explained, unconvincingly, why it is perfectly legal -- then none of the promises to stay within the law will mean a thing. If all Mr. Obama is inclined to do is tweak these programs, then Congress will have to step in to curb these abuses, a path many lawmakers of both parties are already pursuing. There are bills pending that would stop the bulk collection of communications data, restricting it to those under suspicion of terrorism. Other measures would require the surveillance court to make public far more of its work. If the president is truly concerned about public anxiety, he can vocally support legislation to make meaningful changes, rather than urging people to trust him that the dishes are clean. "
"Sharing, With a Safety Net","SAN FRANCISCO -- Kids. The reckless rants and pictures they post online can often get them in trouble, by compromising their chances of getting into a good college or even landing them in jail. What to do about such lapses vexes parents, school officials, the Internet companies that host their words and images -- and the law. Now California legislators are trying to solve the problem with the first measure in the country to give minors the legal right to scrub away their online indiscretions. The legislation puts the state in the middle of a turbulent debate over how best to protect children and their privacy on the Internet, and whether states should even be trying to tame the Web.  The governor, Jerry Brown, has taken no position on the bill. He has until mid-October to sign it, after which, without his signature, the legislation becomes law. California is often in the vanguard when it comes to digital privacy. It was the first state to require companies to report data breaches, and it requires Web sites and mobile apps to post privacy policies that explain how personal information is used. A recently passed law requires Web sites to tell users whether they honor browsers' do-not-track signals. The right-to-delete, or eraser, provision is part of a broader bill that prohibits Web sites, which have ''actual knowledge'' that a minor is using the site based on a profile and activity on the site, from running ads for a range of products -- including alcohol, spray paint, tattoos, tanning beds and e-cigarettes. The eraser section compels online sites to let users under 18 delete rants, tweets, pictures, status updates and other material. Although many companies, including Facebook and Twitter, already offer this option to their users, the California bill would make it a right across the Internet for children who live in that state. ''Kids and teenagers often self-reveal before they self-reflect,'' said James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a San Francisco-based advocacy group that pushed for the law. ''It's a very important milestone.'' The rash revelations by a Texas teenager, Justin Carter, on Facebook last February -- a threatened school shooting his family insists was sarcastic, made in the heat of playing a video game -- landed him in a Texas jail on a felony terrorism charge for nearly six months. His father, Jack, favors the California legislation, but wonders if it would go far enough. ''They should be allowed to delete it, but then again is it really deleted?'' Mr. Carter, 39, of San Antonio, said in an interview this week. Also, Mr. Carter said, if his son had deleted the conversation that someone reported to the authorities, would the deletion be seen as destroying evidence? His son, now 19, is out on a bond, pending trial. Any law trying to tame the Internet, he said, is likely to run into turbulence. ''It's a whole new territory, it grew faster than the laws did,'' Mr. Carter said. ''We're trying to come up with things to make it all neat. There's collateral damage -- my son being one of them.'' Critics of an eraser law see pitfalls. They warn that in trying to protect children, the law could unwittingly put them at risk by digging deeper into their personal lives. To comply with the law, for example, companies would have to collect more information about their customers, including whether they are under 18 and whether they are in California. There are also practical concerns. If other states pass similar laws, companies would be forced to devise multiple policies for the underage residents of different states -- confusing consumers and creating unwieldy requirements for Web businesses that are essentially stateless, except for issues like collecting sales tax. The Internet, opponents of the law say, should be regulated by a uniform set of rules, not piecemeal by the states. ''This is well-meaning legislation but there are concerns about it,'' said Stephen Balkam, president of the Family Online Safety Institute, which advises companies like Facebook and Microsoft on online safety issues. Mr. Balkam said he favored Congressional oversight in issues like children's online privacy and, if necessary, regulation by the Federal Trade Commission. ''Where California leads, others follow,'' he said. ''I think it will be a mess.'' Some supporters of the bill say Internet companies got off easy. The eraser bill does not, for example, require companies to remove the deleted data from its servers altogether, nor does it offer any way to delete material that has been shared by others; a sensational picture that has gone viral, in other words, can't be purged from the Internet. And it is nothing like the right-to-be-forgotten measure that legislators in Europe have been pressing for. That proposal would, at its core, allow all Europeans, not just children, to delete their online personal information; several amendments to the plan address freedom of expression concerns. ''It's an important first step, but there's more to be done,'' Mr. Steyer said. Mr. Steyer's organization, which participated in a safety advisory group with Facebook but soon left after disagreements with the company's approach, has been pushing for more aggressive legislation. Those efforts in 2011 led members of Congress to propose a measure that would have allowed parents to scrub material posted by their children. Criticized by free speech advocates, the bill went nowhere, though Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who was a co-sponsor, plans to introduce it again later this year. Short of federal privacy laws in general, states have been passing laws on a host of privacy matters, in many cases following California's lead. ''Often you need to comply with the most restrictive state as a practical matter because the Internet doesn't really have state boundaries,'' said Mali Friedman, a lawyer in the San Francisco office of Covington & Burling, a national law firm. "
Rules Shielding Online Data from N.S.A. and Other Prying Eyes Advance in Europe,"BRUSSELS -- A panel of European Union lawmakers on Monday night backed a measure that could require American companies like Google and Yahoo to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The vote, by an influential committee at the European Parliament, is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of revelations about a far-reaching spying program by the National Security Agency of the United States. The legislation has been under consideration for two years. The panel, meeting in Strasbourg, France, also endorsed ways of tightening other privacy rules, including fines that could run to billions of euros on the biggest technology companies if they fail to adhere to rules like limiting the sharing of personal data.  The measure, if accepted by Europe, is expected to face fierce lobbying from American officials and technology companies. The legislation would still require the approval of governments and the full European Parliament. ''This evening's vote is a breakthrough for data protection in Europe and would overhaul E.U. rules, ensuring they are up to the task of the challenges in the digital age,'' said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Mr. Albrecht, who is steering the legislation through the European Parliament, added that the committee had ''voted to make clear that it is exclusively E.U. law that applies to E.U. citizens' private data online regardless of where the business processing their data has its seat.'' Timothy Kirkhope, a British member of the committee, said before the vote, ''A more principles-based and less prescriptive regulation would have been a better outcome.'' After the vote, groups representing the technology industry pressed European leaders to oppose some of the measures. John Higgins, the director general of DigitalEurope, which represents companies including Apple, Microsoft and I.B.M., criticized the measure and urged member states to look critically at it. ''Rushing through a half-baked law risks throwing away a vital and much needed opportunity to stimulate economic growth,'' he said. Under current drafts of the legislation, fines would run as high as 100 million euros, ($137 million) or 5 percent of a company's global annual revenue, whichever is higher, rather than a cap of 2 percent, which was the figure proposed by Viviane Reding, the European commissioner for justice, who wrote the original draft of the legislation. Lawmakers want to pass the final bill before spring, partly to burnish their chances of success in European Parliament elections in May. That timetable is strongly supported by Ms. Reding. European leaders are expected to meet in Brussels on Thursday and focus their discussions on using technology to drive economic growth and create jobs. A document circulated before the meeting also indicated that leaders planned to acknowledge a need ''to foster the trust of consumers and businesses in the digital economy.'' The committee vote on Monday night, which Mr. Albrecht said had been delayed twice since April by intense lobbying, gives Mr. Albrecht a mandate to begin negotiating the final legislation with the European Council, the body representing member governments. Two years ago, Washington successfully lobbied Europe to abandon a similar measure that would have shielded Europeans from requests by American authorities to share online data gathered by some of the biggest American Internet companies, many of whose users live in Europe. For technology companies, the concern about the pending legislation is likely to focus more on the high fines for infractions, and on restrictions on sharing personal data that could limit their ability to gain revenue from advertising and offering new services. Andrew Sheridan, an intellectual property lawyer at the firm Freshfields in London, said the level of fines was a concern to many companies. ''The most dramatic part of the reforms are the potential financial penalties,'' Mr. Sheridan said before the vote on Monday. ''If you get data compliance wrong, there's a lot more at stake.''As for the restrictions on data sharing with American authorities, Mr. Sheridan said he expected ''a pragmatic compromise'' in the end. If the proposal becomes law, existing agreements among individual European governments and the United States might keep data flowing across the Atlantic as part of efforts to fight terrorism and crime. ''There already are existing rules for data transfer between Europe and third-party countries like the United States,'' said Luca Schiavoni, a telecom regulatory analyst based in London with Ovum, a technology consulting firm. He added that Europe's more hands-on approach, was ''not surprising based on the E.U.'s tradition of pro-consumer legislation.'' Companies gathering data on Europeans would need to get an ''explicit'' right to consent before sharing their data in some cases. The goal would be to make it easier for online consumers using apps and other computer programs to know when they have agreed to by letting their data be used. Companies involved in social media and location-based advertising complain that the proposed rules would be too onerous. ''There's a very real danger that it becomes meaningless to consumers that we burden them through choice that isn't particularly relevant to them at a particular time,'' said Pat Walshe, the director of privacy for G.S.M.A., an industry group based in Britain representing global mobile telephone operators like Vodafone and Verizon. Mr. Walshe made the remarks in a debate last week with Mr. Albrecht that was publicized on Monday by viEUws, an independent Web television channel. ''We should take a more risk-based approach and reserve consent for those categories of data, and those contexts, where real risks emerge,'' Mr. Walshe said. The draft approved Monday also contains elements aimed at winning over skeptical business interests. Most small and midsize businesses would have fewer requirements than larger companies, like not having to appoint a data protection monitor as long as their main business was not information processing. The draft law also affirms that Europeans have a right to erasure of their data but cannot expect that it will be entirely forgotten in some cases. "
N.S.A. Snooping and the Damage Done,"President Obama spent this week trying to persuade America's close allies, France and Germany, that the National Security Agency's extensive eavesdropping in those countries is under adequate control. He was not entirely successful. His efforts to reassure President François Hollande of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany seem to have been as incomplete as the explanations the administration has given to the American public about the agency's excessive domestic surveillance.  The German government learned this week that the newsmagazine Der Spiegel had new evidence (presumably via information leaked by Edward Snowden) that the N.S.A. had monitored Ms. Merkel's cellphone. On Monday, Le Monde reported that the agency had gathered data on more than 70 million phone calls and messages inside France within one 30-day period, suggesting a surveillance program that went well beyond any legitimate tracking of international terrorists. Mr. Obama sought to assure Ms. Merkel that her phone was not being monitored now and would not be in the future, but he seemed to indicate nothing about past monitoring. David Sanger and Mark Mazzetti reported in The Times on Friday that Germany has evidence of monitoring going back to the George W. Bush administration. The Guardian also reported this week that the phone conversations of at least 35 world leaders were monitored by the N.S.A. in 2006, according to an agency memo leaked by Mr. Snowden. The N.S.A. apparently encouraged American diplomats and officials to provide phone numbers to be added to the surveillance program. Would it be surprising if foreign leaders now became much more restrictive about sharing their numbers with United States officials? Such surveillance undermines the trust of allies and their willingness to share the kind of confidential information needed to thwart terrorism and other threats. When the N.S.A. violates French or German law, law enforcement agencies in those nations cooperate with the agency at their own risk. There is also the more subtle damage done by the feeling that the United States plays by its own rules and respects neither the sovereignty nor the political sensibilities of some of its closest democratic allies. Broad data collection programs by the United States government also harm the efforts of American Internet companies to market their services internationally by casting doubt on their ability to protect privacy. Such companies face heavy legal pressures from the N.S.A. and other intelligence agencies to make private data available for government scrutiny. And there is new pressure on European governments to seek stricter data protection in negotiations for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, with the eavesdropping reports souring the political climate for these talks. European leaders are not naïve about the realities of international snooping. American security is built on the strength and reliability of its international alliances. These should not be put at risk merely because the N.S.A. now has the capacity to monitor more communications in more places than ever. A good way out of this mess would be for Washington to take up the proposal made Friday by Germany and France to negotiate a formal pact that would set mutually acceptable surveillance guidelines. The next steps must come from Mr. Obama. He should move beyond unpersuasive and vague pledges to balance security against privacy, to substantive guidelines that limit the overreaching of N.S.A. surveillance programs abroad and at home. "
"No U.S. Action, So States Move On Privacy Law","State legislatures around the country, facing growing public concern about the collection and trade of personal data, have rushed to propose a series of privacy laws, from limiting how schools can collect student data to deciding whether the police need a warrant to track cellphone locations. Over two dozen privacy laws have passed this year in more than 10 states, in places as different as Oklahoma and California. Many lawmakers say that news reports of widespread surveillance by the National Security Agency have led to more support for the bills among constituents. And in some cases, the state lawmakers say, they have felt compelled to act because of the stalemate in Washington on legislation to strengthen privacy laws. ''Congress is obviously not interested in updating those things or protecting privacy,'' said Jonathan Stickland, a Republican state representative in Texas. ''If they're not going to do it, states have to do it.'' For Internet companies, the patchwork of rules across the country means keeping a close eye on evolving laws to avoid overstepping. Many companies have an internal team to deal with state legislation. And the flurry of legislation has led some companies, particularly technology companies, to exert their lobbying muscles -- with some success -- when proposed measures stand to harm their bottom lines.  ''It can be counterproductive to have multiple states addressing the same issue, especially with online privacy, which can be national or an international issue,'' said Michael D. Hintze, chief privacy counsel at Microsoft, who added that at times it can create ''burdensome compliance.'' For companies, it helps that state measures are limited in their scope by a federal law that prevents states from interfering with interstate commerce. This year, Texas passed a bill introduced by Mr. Stickland that requires warrants for email searches, while Oklahoma enacted a law meant to protect the privacy of student data. At least three states proposed measures to regulate who inherits digital data, including Facebook passwords, when a user dies. Some of the bills extend to surveillance beyond the web. Eight states, for example, have passed laws this year limiting the use of drones, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has advocated such privacy laws. In Florida, a lawmaker has drafted a bill that would prohibit schools from collecting biometric data to verify who gets free lunches and who gets off at which bus stop. Vermont has limited the use of data collected by license plate readers, which are used mostly by police to record images of license plates. California, long a pioneer on digital privacy laws, has passed three online privacy bills this year. One gives children the right to erase social media posts, another makes it a misdemeanor to publish identifiable nude pictures online without the subject's permission, and a third requires companies to tell consumers whether they abide by ''do not track'' signals on web browsers. But stiff lobbying efforts were able to stop a so-called right to know bill proposed in California this year that stood to hurt the online industry. The bill would have required any business that ''retains a customer's personal information'' to share a copy of that information at the customer's request, as well as disclose which third parties have received the information. The practice of sharing customer data is central to digital advertising and to the large Internet companies that rely on advertising revenue. '' 'Right to know' is an example of something that's not workable,'' said Jim Halpert, a lawyer with the national firm DLA Piper, who leads an industry coalition that includes Amazon, Facebook and Verizon. ''It covers such a broad range of disclosures. We advocated against it.'' More than a year ago, the White House proposed a consumer privacy bill of rights, but Congress has not yet taken on the legislation. And a proposed update to the 27-year-old Electronic Communications Privacy Act has stalled. The proposal would require law enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant, based on probable cause, before they could read through emails. Several legislators said they felt compelled to act because Congress had not. ''They don't act in the best interest unless it's in their best interest,'' said Daniel Zolnikov, a first-time legislator in Montana. Mr. Zolnikov, a Republican, suggested that the lack of action was because of lobbying efforts from ''special interests'' on Capitol Hill. So Mr. Zolnikov took up the privacy issue in his state house: Montana became the first state in the nation this year to pass a law that requires police to obtain a search warrant before it can track a suspect's whereabouts through cellphone records. According to a survey conducted in July by the Pew Internet Center, most Americans said they believed that existing laws were inadequate to protect their privacy online, and a clear majority reported making great efforts to mask their identities online. Some of those surveyed said they cleared browsing histories, deleted social media posts or used virtual networks to conceal their Internet Protocol addresses -- and a few even said they used encryption tools. Many states have already responded to those opinions. In the last couple of years, about 10 states have passed laws restricting employers from demanding access to their employees' social media accounts. California set the stage on digital privacy 10 years ago with a law that required organizations, whether public or private, to inform consumers if their personal data had been breached or stolen. Several states followed, and today, nearly every state has a data breach notification law. This year, California amended that landmark law, adding an Internet user's login name and password to the menu of personal information that is covered. The California attorney general's office also has a full-time unit to enforce digital privacy laws. But even in California, the steps taken on privacy legislation are not sweeping overhauls like those supported by the White House. And some bills in the state never become law at all. Last year, the Legislature passed a bill compelling police to seek a warrant before searching cellphone records to track a suspect's location. Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed it, saying it did not strike ''the right balance'' between the needs of citizens and the police. John Pezold, a Republican representative in Georgia, said that issues like creating jobs were more pressing than privacy for many of his constituents. But he said the issue of digital privacy was beginning to bubble up, especially because of the recent reports on eavesdropping by the federal government. ''They're becoming increasingly wary that their lives are going to be no longer their own,'' said Mr. Pezold, who plans to introduce a broad consumer privacy bill in the next legislative session. ''We have got to protect that.'' "
Google to Pay $17 Million to Settle Privacy Case,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Google agreed on Monday to pay $17 million to 37 states and the District of Columbia in a wide-reaching settlement over tracking consumers online without their knowledge. The case involved Google's bypassing of privacy settings in Apple's Safari browser to use cookies to track users and show them advertisements in 2011 and 2012. Google has said it discontinued circumventing the settings early last year, after the practice was publicly reported, and stopped tracking Safari users and showing them personalized ads. The fine is a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars that Google earns in advertising revenue each year. But the case is one of a growing pile of government investigations, lawsuits and punishments related to privacy matters at the company. They include cases involving a social networking tool called Buzz, illegal data collection by Street View vehicles and accusations of wiretapping to show personalized ads in Gmail.  ''Consumers should be able to know whether there are other eyes surfing the web with them,'' Eric T. Schneiderman, attorney general of New York, said in a statement. ''By tracking millions of people without their knowledge, Google violated not only their privacy, but also their trust.'' Google, in a statement, said: ''We work hard to get privacy right at Google and have taken steps to remove the ad cookies, which collected no personal information, from Apple's browsers. We're pleased to have worked with the state attorneys general to reach this agreement.'' In addition to the fine, Google also agreed to avoid using software code that overrides a browser's cookie-blocking settings, to avoid omitting or misrepresenting information to consumers about how they use Google products or control the ads they see, to maintain for five years a web page explaining what cookies are and how to control them, and to ensure that the cookies tied to Safari browsers expire. ''We look at this and say it's a good development for online privacy when the state attorneys general are able to enforce their laws and get Google to change their practices,'' said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy research nonprofit that has filed complaints against Google. Since the Google case began, tracking technology has moved beyond cookies, particularly on mobile devices, which do not use cookies in apps. Regulators and industry groups trying to come up with standards for digital tracking have failed to keep up with the changes. For instance, Google is considering an anonymous identifier, tied to users of its Chrome browser on a specific device, that advertisers would use instead of cookies to target ads. And it introduced new tools like one to track consumers across devices and tell marketers whether a consumer makes a purchase on a computer after researching an item on a phone. Safari, unlike other browsers, blocks cookies from ad networks like Google's. But Google had been exploiting a loophole to avoid the block, install cookies and track Safari users to show them personalized ads. Google has said its actions were unintentional and resulted from a change in Safari of which Google was unaware. Last year, Google agreed to a $22.5 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over the same privacy violation, which the commission said broke the terms of an earlier privacy settlement. It was the largest civil penalty in F.T.C. history. Last month, a Delaware judge dismissed a class-action suit over the same issue. In both the settlement with the F.T.C. and with the states, Google denied any wrongdoing. At the time of the federal settlement, a commissioner, J. Thomas Rosch, said the commission should not have accepted Google's denial, which he called ''inexplicable.'' "
Europe Urges U.S. to Handle Data Privacy With Care,"LONDON -- The European Commission demanded on Wednesday that the American authorities take greater care in protecting European citizens' personal data. But it did not take steps to change the rules that allow American companies like Google and Microsoft to compile that data.  The statement by the commission came against a running debate between European and American officials over online data protection, a discussion that has become increasingly tense after a series of revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about electronic surveillance by the United States in Europe. ''Massive spying on our citizens, companies and leaders is unacceptable,'' Viviane Reding, the European justice commissioner, said in a statement on Wednesday. ''There is now a window of opportunity to rebuild trust, which we expect our American partners to use.'' A so-called safe harbor agreement between Europe and the United States, in place since 2000, enables American technology companies to compile data generated by their European clients in their web searches and other online activities. The companies can use the data for business and marketing purposes in the United States, even though Europe's rules governing online data privacy tend to be more stringent than American rules. Under the agreement, more than 3,000 European and American companies are expected to treat the information with the same privacy protections as if it had remained within the European Union. European politicians, however, have raised concerns that the current arrangement allows the United States government access to data without the express permission of European citizens. And they note that American companies have acknowledged providing information gathered in Europe to American law enforcement agencies. Representatives of Google and Microsoft in Europe were not immediately available for comment. The statement by Ms. Reding came after a five-month review of the agreement. Policy makers at the commission and the European Parliament are completing a draft regulation that could fine companies up to 100 million euros, roughly $136 million, or 5 percent of a company's global annual revenue, whichever is higher, if they fail to protect consumers' personal data. Last month, several members of the European Parliament proposed measures that would require big American online companies to gain approval from European officials before complying with American warrants seeking citizens' data. In its statement on Wednesday, the European Commission asked American regulators to increase transparency over how European citizens' data was used by American companies. European policy makers also want individuals not residing in the United States to be given access to a judicial review process if they believe their data has been used without the correct permission, and to limit the amount of data to which the American government has access. American authorities say they have clamped down on several companies, including Google and Facebook, that have inappropriately used consumers' data. They also say that the current safe harbor pact remains an effective way of protecting online data for both American and European consumers. "
California Suggests Mobile App Privacy Guidelines,"LINK:http://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/pdfs/privacy/privacy_on_the_go.pdf Make your privacy policy readable. Avoid collecting data that you don't need for the app to function normally. Alert users with ""enhanced measures"" if third parties are collecting information, including for advertising.   These are among the tips offered by the California attorney general, Kamala Harris, to mobile app developers, their advertising partners and the platforms that host them. Ms. Harris's office has taken a keen interest in how mobile applications inform their users about the personal data they collect. Last year, she persuaded companies like Apple and Facebook to require apps to display privacy policies, though it is entirely unclear how many people bother to read them, especially on small cellphone screens. In December, she sued Delta Air Lines for failing to tell users how its mobile app used the personal information it collected.   On Thursday, she released a report chronicling what her office called best practices. They go well beyond the requirements of state and federal law - and as such, are unenforceable.  ""Along with the many wonderful capabilities these apps offer, we remain mindful that the mobile environment also poses uncharted privacy challenges, such as the difficulty of providing consumers with meaningful information about privacy choices on small screens and the many players who may have access to sensitive user information,"" the report stated. ""These are challenges that we must confront and that we must resolve in a way that appropriately protects privacy while not unduly stifling innovation.""  The recommendations include those directed at the ad networks that operate silently with app developers, tracking user behavior and deploying it to show tailored advertisements. It is common practice these days for ad networks to collect the unique and immutable numbers that identify each mobile device. The attorney general's report discouraged ad networks from using device identifiers and instead ""transition to using app-specific and/or temporary device identifiers."" She also nudged ad networks to issue privacy policies of their own and explain how they use personal data.  The report also recommended that app developers make clear to users what kind of personal information is collected, for how long is it stored and with whom it is shared. It encouraged using ""plain language and a format that is readable on a mobile device,"" including by using graphic icons, and offering users a way to change the privacy choices they have made before.   "
Senator Seeks More Data Rights for Online Consumers," Before his planned retirement from Congress at the end of next year, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat, intends to give American consumers more meaningful control over personal data collected about them online. To that end, Mr. Rockefeller on Thursday introduced a bill called the ""Do-Not-Track Online Act of 2013."" The bill would require the Federal Trade Commission to establish standardized mechanisms for people to use their Internet browsers to tell Web sites, advertising networks, data brokers and other online entities whether or not they were willing to submit to data-mining.  The bill would also require the F.T.C. to develop rules to prohibit online services from amassing personal details about users who had opted out of such tracking. Mr. Rockefeller proposed the same bill two years ago. But he did not push it in the Senate at the time because industry groups had pledged to voluntarily develop systems to honor the browser-based don't-track-me flags. Last year, however, negotiations between industry groups and consumer advocates over how to execute these mechanisms essentially broke down and have since made little progress. The new Rockefeller bill indicates that the senator believes the industry has not acted in good faith. ""The privacy of Americans is increasingly under assault as more and more of their daily lives are conducted online,"" Mr. Rockefeller, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, wrote on Thursday in an e-mail sent to a reporter. ""Industry made a public pledge to develop do-not-track standards that will truly protect consumer privacy - and it has failed to live up to that commitment. They have dragged their feet long enough."" Industry representatives said that legislation was unnecessary because advertising networks and data brokers several years ago voluntarily introduced their own opt-out program for consumers, called Your AdChoices. Unlike the Do Not Track signals, which would allow users to make a one-time decision about all online tracking from their own browsers, the industry program requires people to go to a site, where they can opt out of receiving marketing offers from several hundred companies based on data-mining. Users also have the option to individually select the companies from whom they prefer not to receive such offers. Stuart Ingis, a lawyer for the Digital Advertising Alliance, an industry consortium, said the program, which involves consumers installing individual cookies on their browsers, demonstrates that users already have choices about data collection. ""It's a lot easier to use a system that is already built and works,"" Mr. Ingis said. Over the last few years, the number of companies that collect information about the reading habits, health concerns, financial capacity, search queries, purchasing patterns and other activities of online consumers has skyrocketed. Industry representatives argue that this benefits people because it enables companies to show them relevant ads, and that the ads themselves finance online sites and services that are free to consumers. Moreover, they say, the data collection is ""anonymous"" because online services typically use numerical customer codes, not real names or e-mail addresses, to track the behavior of individuals. But consumer advocates warn that such profiling systems, which can collect thousands of details on nearly every adult in the United States, can be used to segment some people for preferential offers while relegating others to inferior treatment. Despite industry claims that online tracking is anonymous, a few computer scientists have reported that sites often leak information that can identify individuals, including names, addresses and other details, to third parties. ""Nowadays, there is an incredible proliferation of tracking,"" said Dan Auerbach, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group in San Francisco. ""Data brokers, companies that you never heard of, are collecting massive dossiers about you as you browse around the Web and, right now, there are no limitations on the collection or use of those dossiers."" To give people greater control over their own surveillance online, the Federal Trade Commission ina report on consumer privacy last March urged industry groups to adopt Do Not Track mechanisms by the end of 2012. In fact, the major browsers - Firefox from Mozilla, Google's Chrome, and the more recent iterations of Internet Explorer - already offer the don't-track-me buttons. When these options are turned on, they send out signals to sites, and third parties like ad networks operating on those sites, that certain users do not want to have their information collected. But industry groups and consumer advocates have been at odds for more than a year over how ""Do Not Track"" mechanisms should be presented to users and how online services should respond to the signals. In the absence of legislation or industry consensus, companies are free to ignore those user preferences. Some browsers have responded to this standstill by taking matters into their own hands and blocking third-party tracking cookies, as my colleague Somini Sengupta reported this week. But Mr. Rockefeller's bill indicates that legislative action could pre-empt voluntary industry measures. ""This is a signal that Senator Rockefeller is serious about getting Do Not Track done,"" said David C. Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law. Until last month, Mr. Vladeck served as director of the bureau of consumer protection at the F.T.C. ""I think industry writ large - browser companies, advertising networks, data brokers - are going to understand that he is serious about getting across the finish line."" An earlier version of this post described incompletely the way the Your AdChoices site operates. While users are presented a list of companies that track Web activity for marketing purposes, they can press one button and opt out of them all; it is not the case that users must individually select companies they do not wish to receive marketing offers from.

"Predator Drones Keep an Eye on the Border, Documents Show","The Customs and Border Protection agency deploys drones capable of ""identifying"" a human figure, according to documents obtained by an advocacy group that tracks the use of surveillance technology.  The border agency says it does not use facial recognition technology, but cameras that can distinguish between a beast and a human being and glean whether someone is carrying a rifle or a backpack. Since 2005, the agency has contracted with the San Diego-based General Atomics Aeronautical System and bought 10 Predator drones for use on land and sea borders. The contracts were unearthed this week in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center. The advocacy group has pressed for laws and regulations to ensure privacy, as civilian drones become more common inside the United States. The United States military has used drones, including the Predator, overseas to gather intelligence and carry out targeted strikes on the battleground. Drones within domestic airspace are still largely limited to border surveillance, though law-enforcement agencies around the country have lately sought to purchase smaller, lighter vehicles for policing purposes. In so doing they have faced opposition from civil liberties groups and roughly a dozen state and local governments have proposed measures to limit how they can be used. The Obama Administration last year paved the way for the Federal Aviation Administration to authorize drones for civilian use. In principle, they can be applied for a variety of activities, from dusting crops to monitoring wildlife. They have also engendered fears of government surveillance, because there is no consensus in law on how the data collected can be used, shared or stored. A Customs and Border Protection spokesman said the drones used by his agency offer field agents ""enhanced situational awareness."" According to the contract documents, the sensors attached to the drones would be capable of ""identifying a standing human,"" and ""recognizing a backpack."" The agency spokesman said they cannot identify a particular individual. They can only tell if it is a person or something else. The documents further specify that the drone systems include signals interception receivers. That, said Ginger McCall, director of the open government project at the electronic privacy center, raised concerns about whether the agency could ""intercept communications, including phone conversations."" The agency spokesman said it does not engage in any communications surveillance. The Predator systems weigh about 10,500 pounds and can fly for 20 hours nonstop. They are based in North Dakota, Arizona and Texas; another in Florida specializes in keeping an eye on the water and is used in drug interdiction missions. The border agency has stepped up its use of the unmanned vehicle systems: They flew a total of 5700 hours in 2012. ""This is not an aircraft that's looking through windows,"" the spokesman said.  "
Study: Facebook Users More Protective Even as They Reveal More About Themselves,"Facebook users became much more protective about who sees sensitive information about them, even as they were urged to share more about themselves on the social network, according to an unusual seven-year study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. The study followed the privacy settings of roughly 5,000 Facebook users who were part of the university network on Facebook between 2005 and 2011. It is among the first longitudinal efforts aimed at gauging how Facebook users try to protect their information.   The study showed how over those years, Facebook made changes that  elicited increasing amounts of data. For example, the social network tripled the data fields its users could fill out. It introduced Timeline in 2011, encouraging users to fill in much more personal history, including whether they were expecting a baby or had acquired a new car. Its diverse applications offered users the opportunity to share what news articles and books they read. And it let them ""tag"" one another, effectively allowing one user to post information about a Facebook ""friend."" But even as Facebook encouraged more sharing, users became less likely to reveal to strangers certain pieces of sensitive, fine-grained personal information like dates of birth and what high school they attended, the survey found. There was a similar decline in users revealing their phone numbers and instant-messaging addresses to others in the university network who were not their Facebook ""friends.""  Then, between late 2009 and late 2010, the data found a swift, marked turnaround, as if users had suddenly decided to become more public about what they shared. The more likely explanation, the researchers said, was that the company tweaked its privacy interface in December 2009. The changes proved confusing to many users, who made public some information they may have intended to keep private. Eventually, Facebook's changes to its privacy settings attracted the attention of government regulators. In 2011, the company agreed to let the Federal Trade Commission carry out annual audits of its privacy policies for 20 years. The research paper, written by Alessandro Acquisti, Ralph Gross and Fred Stutzman, is unusual in that it followed the privacy practices of a set of users over an extended period. It did not receive any financing from Facebook or its business rivals.  It is consistent with other studies, including by the Pew Internet Center, which has found that Facebook users increasingly calibrated whom they were sharing with on the social network. Between 2009 and 2011, a growing number of those surveyed by Pew said they had deleted comments and removed someone from among their Facebook ""friends."" Pew documented anxiety among parents of teenagers in particular: About a third of parents surveyed said they had helped their children adjust their privacy settings.  And earlier this year, Pew reported that 61 percent of Facebook users surveyed said they had taken a break from the social network. Among the main reasons, they said, was a lack of time to prune their privacy settings.  Data is at the core of Facebook's business. The company uses aggregated data to show targeted advertisements. It has in recent years offered users a way to control who sees a particular post or picture, as they are about to share it.  The company does not share information about its users' privacy practices. Responding to a request for comment about the research paper, a Facebook spokesman, Andrew Noyes, said in an e-mailed statement: ""Independent research has verified that the vast majority of the people on Facebook are engaging with and using our straightforward and powerful privacy tools - allowing them to control what they're sharing, and with whom they're sharing."" The Carnegie Mellon academics noted that their study focused on a subset of Facebook users, mostly undergraduates who had signed up for Facebook as early as 2005 when it was restricted to college students.  They concluded that ""over time, the amount and scope of personal information that Facebook users have revealed to friends' profiles seems to have markedly increased - and thus, so have disclosures to Facebook itself, third-party apps, and (indirectly) advertisers.""  Hence, the paper is entitled ""Silent Listeners: The Evolution of Privacy and Disclosures on Facebook.""  "
Germany's Complicated Relationship With Google Street View,"Germany is one of the most privacy-sensitive countries in the world. So when Google started taking pictures of buildings and homes for its Street View maps, some people were outraged, even though it was legal.  Then, when Johannes Caspar, the data protection supervisor in Hamburg, Germany, discovered that Google was also illegally collecting personal online data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks, the outrage overflowed. Mr. Caspar's discovery, and his prodding of Google to turn over more information about what it was collecting, led to investigations in at least a dozen countries. Despite Mr. Caspar's persistence in trying to find out what Google was doing - and his dismay at discovering it was collecting private information - when his agency concluded its investigation on Monday, it fined Google $189,225,the amount of money Google made every two minutes last year. Mr. Caspar called on lawmakers to raise the amount that regulators could fine companies. Yet even he did not fine Google the maximum amount that he could have, which would have been $195,000. Why? In an interview on Monday, Mr. Caspar said he had given Google the discount because the company gave him a copy of the German data it had collected and, he said, finally cooperated at the end of the investigation. Google's global privacy counsel, Peter Fleischer, said in a statement that Google had cooperated with Hamburg authorities all along. ""We work hard to get privacy right at Google,"" his statement said. ""But in this case we didn't, which is why we quickly tightened up our systems to address the issue."" Google declined to comment on the size of the fine. Street View has always been a challenge for Google in Europe, because European privacy laws and cultural norms are more sensitive to privacy issues than those in the United States. Google uses technology to blur faces and license plates in its Street View images. But European data protection authorities also required that Google notify the public before the Street View cars start driving on European streets and limit the amount of time that it keeps unblurred images of faces and license plates. In Germany, though, that was not enough. So Google allowed Germans to request that it blur pictures of their homes, too. When Street View went online for Germany's largest cities in 2010, the company said 3 percent of German households opted out. Street View, which Google started in 2007, is in 50 countries as of Tuesday, when the company added Hungary and Lesotho and 350,000 miles of roads worldwide, the largest single update of imagery it has published.

Daily Report: Tech Companies Reveal Some Numbers on Requests for Customer Data,"Technology companies, under fire after revelations that they secretly gave customer information to the federal government, are putting out data to reassure their users, but rather than provide clarity the disclosures have left many questions unanswered, Vindu Goel and Claire Cain Miller report in The New York Times.  Apple, for example, said that from Dec. 1, 2012, through May 31, 2013, it received 4,000 to 5,000 requests for data, covering 9,000 to 10,000 accounts, from American law enforcement agencies. Facebook said it got 9,000 to 10,000 requests for information about its users, covering 18,000 to 19,000 user accounts, in the last six months of 2012. How many of those requests were from federal investigators seeking to sniff out the next terrorist? The companies said they were not allowed to say, although they noted that the requests were commonly related to things like local police investigations and searches for missing children. ""We still don't know what is allowed and how these programs are being implemented,"" said Amie Stepanovich, director of the Domestic Surveillance Project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit research group. But the companies were under immense pressure to announce something. If customers do not trust that Facebook or Microsoft or Google will keep private data confidential, they could use those services far less, undermining the companies' entire business model.  "
2 E-Mail Services Shut Down to Protect Customer Data,"The shutdown of two small e-mail providers on Thursday illustrates why it is so hard for Internet companies to challenge secret government surveillance: to protect their customers' data from federal authorities, the two companies essentially committed suicide. Lavabit, a Texas-based service that was reportedly used by Edward J. Snowden, the leaker who had worked as a National Security Agency contractor, announced the suspension of its service Thursday afternoon. In a blog post, the company's owner, Ladar Levison, suggested - though did not say explicitly - that he had received a secret search order, and was choosing to shut the service to avoid being ""complicit in crimes against the American people."" Within hours, a fast-growing Maryland-based start-up called Silent Circle also closed its e-mail service and destroyed its e-mail servers. The company said it saw the writing on the wall - while also making it plain that it had not yet received any court orders soliciting user data. Mike Janke, the chief executive, said the company's customers included heads of state, members of royalty and government agencies. The company will continue its encrypted phone and text messaging service.  In effect, both businesses destroyed their assets - in part or in full - to avoid turning over their customers' data. Such public displays are far more difficult for large companies to make, and help explain why the most public efforts to challenge secret government orders have come from small companies and nonprofits. ""Providers are in a bind,"" observed Orin Kerr, a law professor who specializes in surveillance law at George Washington University. ""They need to respect the privacy rights of customers in order to keep customers, but they also have an obligation to comply with the law. A small company can say, 'Rather than comply with the law, we will go under.' But Verizon is not going to do that."" He added: ""The government usually has an easier time with large companies because they have more of a long-term need to have good relations with the government."" Large Internet companies have moved more quietly and cautiously, addressing consumers' concerns about government requests only after information about secret orders was leaked by Mr. Snowden. This week, technology industry executives and lobbyists attended meetings at the White House. In an effort to address public concern about the government's surveillance programs, President Obama on Friday announced the creation of a task force to advise the government about how to balance security and privacy. He also said he supported a proposal to change the procedures of the secret court that approves electronic spying under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The level of secrecy appeared to be a particular frustration for Mr. Levison. On the Lavabit site Thursday afternoon, Mr. Levison said he was legally prohibited from explaining why he had been compelled to suspend operations. ""I wish that I could legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot,"" he wrote. ""This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without Congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would strongly recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States,"" he added. Silent Circle's chief executive, Mr. Janke, said executives at his company - the founders include Philip R. Zimmermann, who created the original e-mail encryption protocol known as Pretty Good Privacy - had opted to follow Lavabit's example, even before being served with a government order. He said the incident was a reminder of a fundamental flaw with e-mail technology. An ""aggressive"" government, he said, can extract e-mail data from any company, no matter how good the company's encryption tools. Keys to unlock its customers' encrypted communications had been stored on the company's servers. Silent Circle destroyed that data, the digital equivalent of a library setting fire to its membership records to keep the government from knowing who checked out what books. Silent Circle's text and phone service uses somewhat different technology. The encryption keys are generated between two users as they are communicating and then destroyed. It is aptly called ephemeral encryption. Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer, applauded Lavabit's decision, pointing out that its self-destruction was made possible because it had no shareholders to answer to. ""Could you imagine what would happen if Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page decided to shut down Facebook or Google rather than answer National Security Letters? They couldn't. They would be fired,"" Mr. Schneier wrote on his blog. ""When the small companies can no longer operate, it's another step in the consolidation of the surveillance society."" Before Lavabit, there was Calyx Internet Access, a small Internet service provider and Web hosting company, that challenged the constitutionality of a secret National Security Letter in 2004. Four Connecticut librarians likewise won their gag order challenge under a so-called National Security Letter in 2006. And a similar challenge was brought by a nonprofit digital library, called the Internet Archive; the government had sought information about one of its users, and it won its challenge to a gag order in 2008. The most closely watched ruling on secret orders came this year. The San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation appealed to a United States District judge to lift a gag order issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation through a national security letter. The court said the gag order was unconstitutional.  Large companies have pushed back more quietly. Yahoo is the only company known to have challenged a gag order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. And a coalition of companies, including Google and Microsoft, which sit on a trove of personal communications, have appealed to the Obama administration to be able to disclose just how many Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court orders they receive. According to Justice Department figures, in 2012, government authorities made 1,856 data requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the vast majority for electronic surveillance, and another 15,229 requests through National Security Letters. Nicholas Merrill, the owner of Calyx, received one such letter in early 2004 under the Patriot Act. He closed his business within months. ""I was terrified they were going to drag me away,"" he said Friday. It took him years to challenge the court order. He still cannot discuss its contents, he can only acknowledge its existence. His actions, he said, were possible only because his company was small and he was not beholden to shareholders. ""In a way being a small company is quite liberating,"" he said. Mr. Merrill said he immediately empathized with Mr. Levison's plight. ""I would imagine he feels so strongly about this that he's willing to sacrifice his own business and he's willing to risk angering all his client base for this basic principle,"" he said. ""I can totally relate to where he's coming from.""  Nicole Perlroth contributed reporting.  An earlier version of this post misstated where silent Silent Circle is based. It is based in Maryland, not Washington. An earlier version also misstated the nature of a gag order at issue in the Electronic Frontier Foundation's federal court appeal. The order was issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation through a national security letter, not by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.  An earlier version of the headline on this post misstated how Lavabit handled its customer data when it closed. The company continues to hold user data on its server, it did not destroy the data.  "
"Facebook to Update Privacy Policy, but Adjusting Settings Is No Easier","Facebook announced Thursday that it planned to enact changes to its privacy policies on Sept. 5.  But the social network's famously difficult privacy controls will not become any easier to navigate.  Mostly, the new data use policy and statement of rights and responsibilities lay out more clearly the things that Facebook already does with your personal information, Ed Palmieri, the company's associate general counsel for privacy, said in an interview. ""The updates that we are showing in the red lines are our way to better explain the products that exist today,"" he said. In some ways, the company is making it more clear that it uses a wide variety of personal data about its 1.2 billion users to deliver advertising, including things they share and do, what they like, how they interact with ads and applications, and even demographic data inferred from everything else.  Facebook also said that it might use its customers' profile photos to help their friends tag them in photos. Those photos are already public, but Facebook does not currently use them to help recognize faces when photos are uploaded to the service. ""This will make the product better for people,"" Mr. Palmieri said. ""You can still opt out of it."" But the company is also deliberately deleting information about specific privacy controls. Instead, Mr. Palmieri said, Facebook decided it was better to send users to various other pages, such as one on advertising, to learn more about privacy issues and how to adjust the controls.  For example, the data use policy will no longer offer a direct path to the control for opting out of your name and activities on the site being used as endorsements on ads sent to your friends. Facebook is also doing nothing to simplify its maze of privacy settings.The company doesn't offer clear links or explanations of the settings from its own ""Facebook and Privacy"" page, and its Graph Search feature isn't especially helpful for the task, either. Privacy controls are still buried in at least six different menus. To plunge down the rabbit hole, click on the little lock icon next to your name in the top-left column of your news feed page. You will find privacy settings in the tabs for Privacy, Timeline and Tagging, Blocking, Followers, Apps and Ads. Mr. Palmieri said the company added one section to its policies in response to its $20 million settlement on Monday of a 2011 lawsuit asserting that the company used its customers' personal information in advertising without compensation or allowing them to opt out. The old policy explicitly stated, ""You can use your privacy settings to limit how your name and profile picture may be associated with commercial, sponsored, or related content (such as a brand you like) served or enhanced by us."" Facebook's new language starts with the opposite position. ""You give us permission to use your name, and profile picture, content, and information in connection with commercial, sponsored, or related content (such as a brand you like) served or enhanced by us,"" the company said. ""If you have selected a specific audience for your content or information, we will respect your choice when we use it.""  Mr. Palmieri said the two versions amount to the same thing.  It brings to mind Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking Glass."" As he told young Alice, ""When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less.""  "
Facebook Delays New Privacy Policy,"Facebook has apparently decided to delay a proposed new privacy policy after a coalition of privacy groups asked the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday to block the changes on the grounds that they violated a 2011 settlement with the regulatory agency.  A spokeswoman for the F.T.C. confirmed Thursday that the agency had received the letter but had no further comment. In a statement published by The Los Angeles Times and Politico on Thursday afternoon, Facebook said, ""We are taking the time to ensure that user comments are reviewed and taken into consideration to determine whether further updates are necessary and we expect to finalize the process in the coming week."" Asked about the delay, a Facebook spokesman said he was unaware of the latest developments. When it first announced the changes on Aug. 28, Facebook told its 1.2 billion users that the updates were ""to take effect on September 5."" The changes, while clarifying how Facebook uses some information about its users, also contained a shift in legal language that appeared to put the burden on users to ask Facebook not to use their personal data in advertisements. Previously, the company's terms of use, and its settlement with the F.T.C., had indicated that it wouldn't use such personal data without explicit consent. Facebook's new terms would also allow it to use the names and photos of teenagers in advertising, an area of particular concern to privacy advocates because children may be unaware of the consequences of actions such as liking a brand page. The original proposal has drawn tens of thousands of comments from Facebook users, most of them opposed to the changes.  "
Facebook Shifts Its Rules on Privacy for Teenagers,"Facebook has loosened its privacy rules for teenagers as a rising debate swirls over online threats to children from online bullies and sexual predators, Vindu Goel reports. The move, announced on Wednesday, allows teenagers to post status updates, videos and images that can be seen by anyone, not just their friends or people who know their friends.  While Facebook described the change as giving teenagers more choice, big money is at stake for the social network and its advertisers. Marketers are keen to reach impressionable young consumers, and the more public information they have about those users, the better they are able to target their pitches. ""It's all about monetization and being where the public dialogue is,"" said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a group that lobbies against marketing to children. ""To the extent that Facebook encourages people to put to put everything out there, it's incredibly attractive to Facebook's advertisers."" But that interaction with advertisers now includes youths who are growing up in a world of social media and, often, learning the hard way that it can be full of risks. Parents, too, are trying to help their children navigate the raucous online world that holds both promise and risk. ""They're hitting kids from a neurological weak spot. Kids don't have the same kind of impulse control that adults do,"" said Emily Bazelon, a journalist and author of the book ""Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy.""   "
Senator Raises Questions About Protecting Student Data,"A lawmaker who is a staunch advocate of children's privacy is investigating whether the data collection and analysis practices of the growing education technology industry, a market estimated at $8 billion, are outstripping federal rules governing the sharing of students' personal information.  On Tuesday, Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, sent a letter to Arne Duncan, the Secretary of Education, about how K-12 schools are outsourcing management and assessment of student data, including intimate details like disabilities, to technology vendors. The letter cited an article in The New York Times this month about concerns over the proliferation of student data to companies. ""By collecting detailed personal information about students' test results and learning abilities, educators may find better ways to educate their students,"" Senator Markey wrote in the letter. ""However, putting the sensitive information of students in private hands raises a number of important questions about the privacy rights of parents and their children."" School districts nationwide are increasingly using digital technologies that collect and analyze academic and other details about students in an effort to tailor lessons to the individual child. But privacy law experts say that many schools are employing student assessment software and other services without sufficiently restricting the use of children's personal data by vendors. Researchers at Fordham University School of Law in New York, for example, recently found that certain school districts have signed contracts without clauses to protect information like children's contact details, the locations where they wait for school buses every morning, or the food items they buy in school cafeterias. In his letter, Senator Markey asked Mr. Duncan to explain whether the Department of Education had assessed the types of student information schools share with private companies; whether the department had issued federal standards or guidelines that outline the steps schools should take to protect student data stored and used by private companies; what kinds of security measures the department requires companies to put in place to safeguard student data; and whether federal administrators believe that parents, not schools, should have the right to control information about their children even if it is housed by private companies. ""Sensitive information such as students' behavior and participation patterns also may be included in files outsourced to third-party data firms and potentially distributed more widely to additional companies without parental consent,"" Senator Markey wrote. ""Such loss of parental control over their child's educational records and performance information could have longstanding consequences for the future prospects of students.""  "
Steps to Guard Against Identity Fraud,"If you get a letter notifying you that your personal data was involved in a corporate data breach, you should pay close attention, a new report says. Nearly a quarter of people who receive such letters become victims of identity fraud, the report, from Javelin Strategy & Research, found. (The firm makes a consumer versionof its report available free.) The latest report from Javelin is based on an online survey, using a probability-based panel fielded by Knowledge Networks, which questioned 5,249 adults in the United States from Sept. 20 to Oct. 12, 2012. For questions answered by all participants, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus one percentage point; for questions answered by all 857 participants who were identity fraud victims, it is plus or minus three percentage points.  The survey was sponsored in part by Citigroup Inc., Intersections LLC and Visa Inc. The sponsors were not involved in the tabulation, analysis or reporting of the final results, Javelin said. The annual report found that the incidence of identity theft overall was about 5.3 percent of consumers, compared with 4.9 percent the year before. Much of the increase was driven by so-called ""new account"" fraud, involving the unauthorized opening of general use or store brand credit cards, as well as ""account takeover"" fraud, in which the identity thieves may change consumers' contact information - like their mailing addresses - to gain illegal access to their accounts, the report said. Data breaches involving Social Security numbers are the most damaging, the report found, because they can be used to open new accounts and authenticate existing ones. Consumers who had their Social Security number compromised in a data breach were five times more likely to be the victim of fraud than consumers on average. So, what should you do if you get a breach letter? First, contact the company to make sure the letter is legitimate, Javelin advises. Then, don't take the letter as some sort of reassurance. If you get one, you need to be more vigilant - not less - about checking your account statements and your credit report for suspicious activity, like new accounts you don't remember opening or charges you didn't make. ""We have a national problem, which is getting people to take these notifications seriously,"" said Jim Van Dyke, Javelin's chief executive. If the company reporting the breach offers free monitoring of your credit report, you should use it, Mr. Van Dyke advised. ""A surprising proportion of people don't even take advantage of an offer of free service,"" he said. At a minimum, you can check your credit reports without charge at AnnualCreditReport.com. (You can also request one from the different credit bureau - there are three big ones - every four months.) Putting a security freeze on your credit report stops the fraudulent opening of new accounts without your knowledge. There may, however, be an ""inconvenience"" factor involved in lifting the freeze, in case you do want to apply for credit, Mr. Van Dyke said. (There's also usually a small fee involved, unless you're already an identity theft victim.) Putting a fraud alerton your credit report is a less sweeping step that lets lenders know to do extra checking before issuing new credit in your name, and is usually a good idea if your Social Security number is compromised. A security freeze or fraud alert won't help if the data exposed in the breach was, say, the account number of a credit card you already had open. In that case, you need to check your account regularly - either online, or by checking your paper statement - for suspicious charges. Or, as the Identity Theft Resource Center suggests, you can request a new cardwith a new account number, if the card company doesn't offer you one voluntarily. What other steps can you take? In general, Javelin advises, never reveal your full nine-digit Social Security number unless it's necessary. If you're asked for it to establish your identity, ask if you can provide another form of identification instead. Also, ask service providers like cable companies and utilities to replace the last four digits of your Social Security number with a different four-digit security code to validate your identity when you call for service. Even if you don't get a breach letter, Javelin advises monitoring your bank and credit card accounts electronically at least once a week - and preferably daily. Use whatever method is easiest for you - checking online, via a mobile app, or touch-tone banking. And take advantage of any automatic account alerts your bank offers. Have you ever received a data breach notice? What did you do as a result?  "
How Cyberwarfare and Drones Have Revolutionized Warfare,"Since World War II there have been many advances in military weaponry, communications and technology. In early May 1942, naval forces from Imperial Japan and the allied forces of Australia and the United States fought in the Battle of the Coral Sea. That engagement was the first battle in which naval ships did not shoot upon or even see the opposing force. Aircraft carriers directly engaged one another using aircraft, with their long-distance reach, as their sole offensive weaponry. This new type of warfare, the carrier versus carrier, was an inevitable escalation of the air, radio and radar technology of the day. It was viewed as a revolution in military affairs. There is a tendency within military circles to call a particular advancement in technology a ""revolution."" That was the case when former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld trumpeted technological advances as enabling the United States to wage war in Afghanistan and Iraq without significant numbers of troops. More often than not, an advancement in technology ends up only incrementally changing how war is fought.  But there have been true revolutions in military affairs since the Battle of the Coral Sea, including the development of nuclear and space weapons. And now there is much discussion over two recent advancements in United States military capabilities: cyberwarfare and drones.   We believe the next few decades will be dominated by advancements in software and hardware (cyber and robotics, including drones) just as the last decade was dominated by counterinsurgency. We also believe that historians will look back and see advancements in cyberwarfare and robotics as the first two revolutions in military affairs of the 21st century. While we were deployed overseas, we saw firsthand the impact of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, in a counterinsurgency fight. Drones enabled headquarters to break through the fog of war swiftly, giving commanders greater command and control over the battlefield. At the same time, our ability to undermine the enemy's communications network was important in the counterinsurgency fight. Often this involved using basic jammers to disrupt insurgents' abilities to trigger improvised explosive devices using cellphones. While on the lower end of the technological spectrum, those jammers saved lives. Just as aircraft carriers allowed naval battles to extend their strike distance to the point of aircraft versus aircraft warfare, drones are increasing the strike distance of the military. Nanorobots will further increase the ability to deal precise damage. Drones are often the preferred choice of policymakers because they place no American lives at risk.  Cybertechnology also extends the reach of the military, with the Stuxnet attack on Iran's nuclear weapons program serving as a prime example. Thanks to the Internet, cyberwarriors can reach immediately not only into the Web-connected world, but also into computers without direct Internet access - all without putting Americans in harm's way.  But these advances will require policymakers to rethink the economic, political and moral calculus for when and how to deploy robots, or when to commence a cyberattack. Not only do the advanced technologies eliminate the problems with having troops die on foreign soil, but they also greatly decrease the cost of weapons. Weaponized drones are far less expensive than manned jets. Drone costs will continue to fall and their capabilities will continue to increase as robotics technology advances. Why buy the costly F-35 fighter jet when the military can instead buy a fleet of weaponized drones?   Moreover, many people believe that all robots are airborne weapons. But they have long been used by explosive ordnance soldiers when defusing bombs. As robotic technology advances, the Terminator movies might seem less like science fiction. In the cyberrealm, the big costs - the satellites and fiber cables - have already been paid for. With that infrastructure in place, a few thousand lines of code can now be an effective weapon to inflict disarray and damage. But that also means that securing the network is more important than ever, underscored by the publishing of classified military and diplomatic documents by WikiLeaks and the more recent leaks of National Security Agency records by Edward J. Snowden. Decreasing costs can be a double-edged sword. Just as I.E.D.s became the highly effective yet inexpensive weapons of choice for insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan, robots and cyber technology could be the same for adversaries seeking to attack the United States. As costs have declined, these dual-purpose technologies have already become widely available to both state governments and nonstate actors. This new type of warfare will make it harder to identify the source of an attack using either unmanned vehicles (land, air or sea) or cyber technology. Yet after the intelligence failures in Iraq, it will perhaps be more important than ever for the government to be able to assure its citizens that its intelligence is accurate about the identity of an attacker.  Yet as rapidly as this technology is developing, Americans are just beginning to think hard about the policy implications. Many Americans have begun expressing concerns regarding domestic drone use at home and the potential for lasting foreign policy damage caused by the drone war in Pakistan. And the recent leaks about NSA surveillance programs and the debate over the proposed Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, which would make it easier for tech companies to share information about computer security threats with government agencies, seem to have kindled concerns among many Americans that their own privacy is at stake.   These new kinds of warfare seem likely to further empower the executive branch at a time when our nation no longer declares war, potentially making the War Powers Actseem even less constraining and thus more outdated. Ultimately, it seems possible that these major changes will make it easier to wage war because the risks to American servicemen have been minimized. Wars will be fought not only by soldiers with boots on the ground but also by soldiers sitting in front of computer and video monitors. Tomorrow's future warriors could very much resemble today's civilian Xbox video gamers. We are glad to see that the U.S. government is now taking an active role in developing those future warriors with cyber competitions. This is a tactic long used by other countries, like China. However we are concerned about how the government expects to field a large cyber force quickly. Although efforts are underway to train new security and cyber professionals, there is currently an inadequate number of leaders and experienced engineers to expand this force. The government will either have to develop its own experienced officers, or continue to use private contractors - like Mr. Snowden, who worked for one of the N.S.A.'s principal contractors, Booz Allen Hamilton. And filling the ranks will be difficult, too: there is intense competition for experienced engineers in both the cyber and robotics industries. The future will require a nimble military that will be able to wage full spectrum warfare from counterinsurgency in remote outposts in Afghanistan's tribal regions to a cyberwarfare campaign possibly initiated in the basement of a state or nonstate actor. Like other major technological changes facing society today, the problem will not be whether or not technology can accomplish a certain feat but whether our nation's leaders fully understand the moral, social and political consequences of utilizing such technologies.

Speeding Up Gmail Delivery,"Q. My Gmail on Firefox has gotten really slow lately and sometimes I can't see attachments. I don't think it's my network connection and I still have plenty of space left in my mailbox, so what might be causing the pokiness? A. Some antivirus and security programs may interfere with Gmail and cause it to load slowly. If you have always had the security software and Gmail just recently slowed, something else may be the reason. (If the security software is new, try turning it off temporarily to see if it was causing the problem and if so, visit the company's website for support information about Gmail.)  Browser extensions and add-ons can also hinder Gmail, so try disabling any recent additions first to see if the mail speeds up. Select Add-ons from the Tools menu in Firefox to make adjustments. Clearing the browser cache (a repository of images and other files from sites) often fixes slow Gmail behavior. Mozilla has instructions for clearing the Firefox cache at http://mzl.la/MyNb9w. Force-Quitting Apps in iOS 7 Q. How do you quit iPad apps in iOS 7? You used to be able to double-click the Home button and zap them from that little panel at the bottom of the screen, but now double-clicking the Home button just brings up a screen where you can switch to different open apps. A. Apple changed a few things around in its new iOS 7 software, but you still begin the process of forcing an app to close by double-clicking the iPad's home button. When you land on the multitasking display that shows your open apps in small windows, flick the screen until the app you want to quit is visible. Next, place your finger on the app's mini-window and drag it up toward the top of the screen with your fingertip. Once you discard the app's open window, it closes. Press the iPad's Home button again to return to your Home screen, where you can try starting the app again or move on to something else. TIP OF THE WEEK Need to safely shut down the computer in a hurry without fumbling around in menus? In recent versions of both Windows and Mac OS X, you can summon the Shut Down box with keystrokes. When in the app-and-tile half of Windows 8 and 8.1, press the Control, Alt and Delete keys to jump to a screen with several options. These include commands to lock the screen, switch users, sign out of the computer or go to the Task Manager -- and there is also a virtual power button in the lower-right corner with a shutdown command. If you happen to be in the desktop mode, press the Alt and F4 keys to get a box with the shutdown option; you can also choose sleep, restart and a few other actions from the drop-down menu in the box. (Pressing the Windows and the X key also reveals a menu with the shutdown command in the lower-left corner of the screen.) In Mac OS X, press the power button on the keyboard or Mac itself to get the dialogue box asking if you would like to shut down the computer; you can also choose to restart it or put it to sleep. On Macs that have an Eject key on the keyboard, pressing the Control and Eject keys also calls up the shutdown box. Pressing the Control, Command and Eject keys closes all your open programs and restarts the Mac, while pressing the Control, Option, Command and Eject keys together closes all open programs and shuts down the Mac.

Rights Group Reports on Abuses of Surveillance and Censorship Technology,"A Canadian human rights monitoring group has documented the use of American-made Internet surveillance and censorship technology by more than a dozen governments, some with harsh human rights policies like Syria, China and Saudi Arabia. The Citizen Lab Internet research group, based at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, used computer servers to scan for the distinctive signature of gear made by Blue Coat Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif. It determined that Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates employed a Blue Coat system that could be used for digital censorship. The group also determined that Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela used equipment that could be used for surveillance and tracking.  The authors said they wanted to alert the public that there was a growing amount of surveillance and content-filtering technology distributed throughout the Internet. The technology is not restricted from export by the State Department, except to countries that are on embargo lists, like Syria, Iran and North Korea. ''Our findings support the need for national and international scrutiny of the country Blue Coat implementations we have identified, and a closer look at the global proliferation of dual-use information and communications technology,'' the group noted. ''We hope Blue Coat will take this as an opportunity to explain their due diligence process to ensure that their devices are not used in ways that violate human rights.'' A spokesman for Blue Coat Systems said the firm had not seen the final report and was not prepared to comment. In 2011, several groups, including Telecomix and Citizen Lab, raised concerns that Blue Coat products were being used to find and track opponents of the Syrian government. The company initially denied that its equipment had been sold to Syria, which is subject to United States trade sanctions. Shortly afterward, Blue Coat reversed itself and acknowledged that the systems were indeed in Syria, but it said that the devices had been shipped to a distributor in Dubai, and said that it thought that they had been destined for the Iraqi Ministry of Communications. The Citizen Lab research project was led by Morgan Marquis-Boire and Jakub Dalek. Mr. Marquis-Boire, a Google software engineer, has during the last year been involved in a variety of research projects aimed at exposing surveillance tools used by authoritarian regimes. He said that he carefully segregated his work at Google from his human rights research. Last year, Mr. Marquis-Boire used computer servers to identify the use of an intelligence-oriented surveillance software program, called FinSpy, which was being used by Bahrain to track opposition activists. On a hunch last month, the researchers used the Shodan search engine, a specialized Internet tool intended to help identify computers and software services that were connected to the Internet. They were able to identify a number of the Blue Coat systems that are used for content filtering and for ''deep packet inspection,'' a widely used technology for detecting and controlling digital content as it travels through the Internet. The researchers stressed that they were aware that there were both benign and harmful uses for the Blue Coat products identified as ProxySG, which functions as a Web filter, and a second system, PacketShaper, which can detect about 600 Web applications and can be used to control undesirable Web traffic. ''I'm not trying to completely demonize this technology,'' Mr. Marquis-Boire said. The researchers also noted that the equipment does not directly fall under the dual-use distinction employed by the United States government to control the sale of equipment that has both military and civilian applications, but it can be used for both political and intelligence applications by authoritarian governments. ''Syria is subject to U.S. export sanctions,'' said Sarah McKune, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab. ''When it comes to other countries that aren't subject to U.S. sanctions it's a more difficult situation. There could still be significant human rights impact.'' The researchers also noted that a large number of American and foreign companies supplied similar gear in what Gartner, the market research firm, described as a $1.02 billion market in a report issued in May 2012. The researchers said that some American security technology companies, like Websense, had taken strong human rights stands, but had declined to grapple with the issue of the possible misuse of the technology.

"Devices Given to Chinese Legal Advocate Had Tracking Spyware, N.Y.U. Says","BEIJING -- Dissidents inside China have long been accustomed to a lack of privacy in their daily routines. Phone conversations are monitored, e-mails are read and public security agents trail human rights activists when they venture outside their homes. But according to officials at New York University, several electronic devices that were given to Chen Guangcheng, a Chinese legal advocate, soon after his arrival in the United States last year were loaded with spyware designed to track his family's movements and their online activity.  Two of those devices, an iPhone and an iPad, were given to Mr. Chen by China Aid, a Texas-based Christian group that pushes for greater religious freedom in China. Bob Fu, the president of the group, said that he was out of the country when Mr. Chen arrived in New York so his wife, Heidi, handed over the equipment. The discovery of the tracking software came as a complete surprise, he said. ''This story is just crazy,'' said Mr. Fu, an exiled Chinese dissident who championed Mr. Chen's plight during the years of persecution Mr. Chen endured as an opponent of forced abortion. The allegations, first reported by Reuters, threatened to further complicate an already messy narrative surrounding Mr. Chen's tenure at N.Y.U., which includes accusations that school officials, bowing to pressure from the Chinese government, sought to curtail his public advocacy and then forced him to leave the Greenwich Village campus sooner than he expected. School officials and associates of Mr. Chen, who is blind, have vehemently rejected such assertions and insisted that his fellowship at N.Y.U. was always meant to last one year. Mr. Chen has declined to provide evidence backing up his assertions, issued in a brief statement last Sunday, that Beijing pressured N.Y.U. to terminate what he acknowledged was a generous arrangement that included tutors, security and housing for him, his wife, and their two children. With Mr. Chen silent in recent days, Mr. Fu has become one of his more vocal advocates, eagerly telling reporters what Mr. Fu said were instances in which N.Y.U. tried to limit Mr. Chen's access to conservative political figures and advocates who opposed abortion. Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, who frequently confers with Mr. Fu on human rights issues in China, has threatened to convene a Congressional hearing on Mr. Chen's time at N.Y.U. According to people with knowledge of the episode, Mr. Fu's wife presented the Apple devices to an assistant of Jerome Cohen, the N.Y.U. law professor who was instrumental in arranging Mr. Chen's exit from the American Embassy in Beijing, where he had sought refuge after escaping house arrest. The gifts, along with at least two other phones that were handed to the assistant, arrived on the chaotic day Mr. Chen and his family landed in New York. After an examination by N.Y.U. technicians, all the devices were found to be compromised with spyware, said an associate, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. The spyware included global positioning software that allowed a third party to track the whereabouts of the device, and presumably its owner, and another program that copied its contents to a remote server. After removing the spyware, technicians returned the Apple devices to the Chens, who were told about what had happened. The two other phones, their provenance a mystery, were not given to Mr. Chen. ''He was upset, but he was more concerned about the relatives he left behind who were being mistreated by the authorities,'' the associate said. Mr. Fu was not informed about the spyware on the items, and by all accounts, his relationship with the family deepened in the months that followed. John H. Beckman, an N.Y.U. spokesman, confirmed the broad outlines of the episode but said he had no further information. Professor Cohen told Reuters he thought the compromised devices were an attempt to keep tabs on Mr. Chen remotely. ''These people supposedly were out to help him, and they give him a kind of Trojan horse that would have enabled them to monitor his communications secretly,'' he said. Professor Cohen was traveling in Asia on Friday and could not be reached for comment. In an interview, Mr. Fu said he learned on Thursday from Reuters that the items his wife had bought at an AT&T store in Texas were compromised. He said a technician he employs had activated the devices and added Skype but nothing else. He suggested that the spyware could have been installed after his wife dropped off the items but before they were given to the Chens, a gap of at least a day. ''More than anyone else, we want to get to the bottom of this,'' he said, adding that he had asked the F.B.I. to look into the matter. ''We will fully cooperate with any investigation and hope N.Y.U. will do the same.'' "
How Surveillance Changes Behavior: A Restaurant Workers Case Study,"Surveillance is certainly much in the news lately. Most notably, of course, there is the continuing outcry over the National Security Agency's call-tracking program, disclosed in the documents leaked by Edward Snowden. But surveillance even surfaced as a subject in last week's televised debate among the Democratic candidates for mayor in New York. The office seekers were asked whether New York City should have more surveillance cameras. Six of the seven, card-carrying liberals all, replied without hesitation, yes. (Only Anthony Weiner said no.) Most of the public discussion of surveillance technology and its use revolves around the question: Is it spooky or reassuring?  But another issue is the effect of surveillance on behavior. And a new research paper, published on Saturday, shows in detail how significant the surveillance effect can be.  The paper, ""Cleaning House: The Impact of Information Technology Monitoring on Employee Theft and Productivity,"" is the work of three academics: Lamar Pierce, an associate professor at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis; Daniel Snow, an associate professor at the Marriott School at Brigham Young University; and Andrew McAfee, a research scientist at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The researchers measured the impact of software that monitors employee-level theft and sales transactions, before and after the technology was installed, at 392 restaurants in 39 states. The restaurants were in five ""casual dining"" chains. The paper does not name the five,  but it cites examples of the casual dining category including Applebee's, Chili's and Olive Garden. Employee theft and fraud is a big problem, estimated at up to $200 billion a year across the economy. In the restaurant industry, analysts estimate the losses from employee theft at 1 percent of revenue. That does not seem like a lot, but restaurant profit margins are slender, typically 2 to 5 percent. So cutting down on theft can be an important contributor to a restaurant's financial health. Most of the restaurant industry pays its servers low wages and they depend on tips. Employee turnover is high. In that environment, a certain amount of theft has long been regarded as a normal part of the business. Unethical behavior runs the gamut. There is even a how-to book on the subject, published in 2004, ""How To Burn Down the House: The Infamous Waiter and Bartender's Scam Bible by Two Bourbon Street Waiters."" A simple example is a bartender's not charging for a round of drinks, and urging the customers to ""take care of me"" - with a large tip. Other tactics are more elaborate. But monitoring software is now available to track all transactions and detect suspicious patterns. In the new study, the tracking software was NCR's Restaurant Guard product, and NCR provided the data. The software is intentionally set so that a restaurant manager gets only an electronic theft alert in cases that seem to clearly be misconduct. Otherwise, a manager might be mired in time-consuming detective work instead of running the restaurant. The savings from the theft alerts themselves were modest, $108 a week per restaurant. However, after installing the monitoring software, the revenue per restaurant increased by an average of $2,982 a week, or about 7 percent.  The impact, the researchers say, came not from firing workers engaged in theft, but mostly from their changed behavior. Knowing they were being monitored, the servers not only pulled back on any unethical practices, but also channeled their efforts into, say, prompting customers to have that dessert or a second beer, raising revenue for the restaurant and tips for themselves. ""The same people who are stealing from you can be set up to succeed,"" said Mr. Pierce of Washington University. In the research, the data sets were sizable. For example, there were more than 630,000 transactions by servers tracked and collected each week over the course of the project. But more significant, the researchers say, is what the data analysis might contribute to fields of study like social psychology and behavioral economics - and the business discipline of human resources management. In human resources, much emphasis is placed on employee selection: if you pick the right people, they will do the right thing. Instead, this research suggests that the surveillance effect on employee behavior is striking. ""What's surprising is the weird effectiveness of the intervention, once the monitoring technology is in place,"" said Mr. McAfee of M.I.T. Not surprisingly, NCR is delighted by the results. ""It validates the customer data we've seen,"" said Jeff Hindman, a vice president at NCR. ""But this is done by outside experts with the academic standards and statistical rigor they bring to the analysis.""  "
ID Verification Lagging on Health Care Website,"WASHINGTON -- Just days before the Obama administration's self-imposed deadline to fix the troubled federal health insurance website, officials said Monday that they were aware of another problem that has prevented thousands of people who were unable to verify their identity from shopping for health plans. Many users of the website have had their applications cast into limbo after they uploaded copies of documents like driver's licenses, Social Security cards and voter registration cards, or sent them to the office of the federal insurance marketplace in London, Ky.  Administration officials said the government had established strict procedures to verify that people applying for insurance were who they said they were, in order to prevent fraud and identity theft. But a breakdown in the process instead is causing concern among some consumers about the handling of their personal information. ''I am in no man's land,'' said Roger N. Hampton of Boca Raton, Fla., who filed an application early last month. ''I have been waiting patiently for my ID verification to come through, which has not occurred thus far. So I can't see what plans are available.'' When he tried to file his application online, Mr. Hampton received a message that said: ''Your identity wasn't verified. You won't be able to submit your application for health coverage until your identity is verified. Submit documents that prove your identity. Once you upload your documents, they'll be reviewed. The results of your identity verification will be emailed to you.'' Mr. Hampton hit a button that said, ''Upload documents'' and attached copies of his Social Security card and driver's license. He said he had heard nothing back. John W. Filbin of New London, N.H., reported a similar experience. ''I have been stuck in identity proofing since early October,'' he said Monday. On Friday, the Obama administration announced that it would give people eight more days, until Dec. 23, to sign up for coverage that takes effect on Jan. 1 But Mr. Filbin said: ''We don't need extra time. We've been ready since Oct. 1. I have emailed and hard mailed my driver's license. We've made our way through the slow and troubled website. Is there going to be a fix for us?'' People who cannot establish their identity by answering certain questions at HealthCare.gov are instructed to call the help desk at Experian, a credit reporting agency, for ''ID proofing.'' Customer service representatives for the federal marketplace and for Experian said they had received calls from many people who were unable to verify their identity, and internal government documents show that lower-level federal employees have known of a problem for weeks. Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that 90 percent of consumers were able to create accounts and complete ''identity proofing'' online. ''However,'' she said, ''some consumers whose information does not match records, such as when an alternate name is used or their address does not match, may be referred to a call center'' for identification verification, and in complicated cases they may experience ''a wait time before receiving a determination.'' Mr. Filbin said he had called Experian, but got no help because he did not have a ''reference number.'' Experian sent him back to HealthCare.gov, which has repeatedly indicated that his identity verification is ''in process.'' Jo Ann Fields of Felton, Del., appears to be lost in the same labyrinth. ''I mailed a copy of my voter registration card on Oct. 24, and I have not heard anything back,'' Ms. Fields said. ''I uploaded the voter registration card, and they said I would get an email response. I have had no response. I called the health insurance marketplace -- 800-318-2596 -- and they say to give it more time. My application is stuck in ID verification.'' Consumers said they worried that their identification papers were falling into a black hole. Ms. Fields said she imagined ''a bag of mail sitting on somebody's desk in London, Ky., with my voter registration card in it.'' Insurance agents and brokers who want to help people enroll in the federal marketplace also need to go through ''identity proofing,'' and they say they, too, have experienced difficulties. Mr. Filbin said the experience was particularly annoying because ''I am in favor of the Affordable Care Act,'' and he added: ''I was an Obama supporter. I think I still am, but a little less positive.'' Experian is based in Dublin. Two spokesmen for the company, Gerry Tschopp and Michael Troncale, said they could not discuss Experian's work for the federal insurance program because of restrictions in its contract with the government. The federal website says identity verification is needed to protect consumers' personal information. Consumers are asked questions that, according to the government, only they can answer. The questions are based on information in their credit reports -- even though federal officials expect to receive many applications from young people and low-income people with little credit history. The administration said that the website had another ''unscheduled outage'' on Monday, for about an hour. Still, administration officials said they were on track to meet their commitment that HealthCare.gov would ''work smoothly for the vast majority of users'' by Saturday. "
Ministers Express Doubts on Expanding Data Protection Laws,"BERLIN -- E.U. justice ministers reacted coolly on Friday to a plan that would give consumers the ability to expunge the personal details Internet businesses have collected on them, essentially allowing individuals to block most kinds of online ads. During an informal meeting in Dublin, the ministers expressed reservations about elements of the proposal, which would impose new limits on data collection and profiling and give national regulators the ability to levy hefty fines equal to 2 percent of sales on companies that failed to comply.  Alan Shatter, the Irish justice minister who chaired the closed-door meeting, said the ministers were concerned that the measures would stymie the Internet's development by hampering the targeted advertising that makes possible most free services. ''An overall conclusion is that there is widespread acceptance of the need for a uniform approach to regulation,'' Mr. Shatter said at a news conference. ''There is also a widespread understanding of the need to ensure that business can properly work under any new structure while ensuring the existence of certain protections.'' Ireland holds the European Union's rotating presidency through June, and Mr. Shatter is seeking an agreement among justice ministers on the proposal. The ministers must approve the plan before a proposal is put to the European Parliament. Europe last updated its primary data protection laws in 1995, when the Internet was in its infancy and the concept of mining consumer data did not yet exist. The legislative effort to produce an updated law is expected to continue into 2014. Mr. Shatter described the discussions with ministers as ''very interesting and considered'' but noted that the conclusion of the group, at least initially, was that updated E.U. data protection laws must be ''balanced and proportionate'' and not stifle businesses. The comments by the ministers, their first public statements on the proposal, suggest that privacy advocates have a long road ahead. Viviane Reding, the European justice commissioner who initially proposed the changes last year, said much work still needed to be done. Appearing with Mr. Shatter, Ms. Reding referred to the ''difficult work on the table'' before officials could put forth a plan. She said enhanced consumer protections would encourage more online commerce, which in turn would bolster the European economy. She referred to a European Commission study showing that Web businesses could save an estimated &#x20ac;2.3 billion, or $3.1 billion, in legal and other fees if E.U. data protection laws were harmonized. ''There needs to be the trust between citizens and the data controllers,'' Ms. Reding said, adding that the more trust there was, the better it would be for business. ''So this is a growth-enhancing project.'' Web businesses and advertisers see it differently. They consider the effort to tighten controls a threat to the advertising model that finances much of the Internet. Individual E.U. members are also divided on the issue. According to a confidential memo prepared on Dec. 12 by E.U. administrators from Cyprus, which at the time held the Union's rotating presidency and presided over meetings on the issue last year, several European countries have reservations about expanding consumer protections on the Internet. Four countries -- Austria, Estonia, France and Ireland -- supported the new right to be forgotten, according to a summary of the meeting seen by the International Herald Tribune, but many countries expressed doubts, like Britain, Germany, Spain, Denmark and Luxembourg. Representatives of Britain, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands said a new online ''right to be forgotten'' could be used to limit freedom of expression, chilling the flow of information on the Web. According to the memo, representatives of Britain, which has one of the largest advertising industries in Europe, repeatedly objected to many elements, citing concern for how the measure would affect the Internet's development.

Google Faces More Inquiries in Europe Over Privacy Policy,"Instead of facing one European investigation into its privacy policy, Google now has to contend with at least six of them. Data protection agencies in Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands said on Tuesday that they were moving to take action against Google over the policy, which the company introduced last year. They joined the French regulator, which had initiated a European Union inquiry on behalf of its counterparts across the 27-nation bloc. While the regulators have repeatedly threatened the company with tough talk of a united front, the news on Tuesday reflects the reality that privacy laws are fragmented across the European Union, giving Google little incentive to yield.  Enforcement is a matter for national agencies, rather than Brussels. But the French data protection agency, which is known by the initials C.N.I.L., said it would cooperate with the other countries as they step up their scrutiny. The C.N.I.L. said it had ''notified Google of the initiation of an inspection procedure,'' the latest step in a drawn-out investigation that began more than a year ago, when the agency said it thought the company's privacy policy violated European Union law. Other agencies said they would conduct their own inquiries, building on the work of the C.N.I.L. The Google privacy policy streamlined the individual practices that had been in place across more than 60 Google services, from its search engine to its online mapping operation to YouTube. The company said at the time that this was necessary to provide clarity to users, and to improve its services. But European regulators, led by the C.N.I.L., said that the company had been insufficiently forthcoming about its use of personal data, especially when the information was used across different services for purposes like advertising. Last October, the heads of the 27 regulatory agencies wrote to Google's chief executive, Larry Page, demanding changes in the policy. They asked the company to do so within four months or risk sanctions. ''After this period has expired, Google has not implemented any significant compliance measures,'' the C.N.I.L. said in a statement. Google has insisted that its use of data complies with European Union law, and it stood by that position Tuesday. ''We have engaged fully with the data protection authorities involved throughout this process, and we'll continue to do so going forward,'' the company said. Each of the national regulators now investigating Google has different procedures and enforcement powers. In France, for example, the C.N.I.L. can fine privacy violators up to 300,000 euros, or about $385,000 -- a drop in the bucket for a global giant like Google. In some countries, regulators can bring criminal complaints; in others, they cannot. The European Commission, led by its vice president, Viviane Reding, has been pushing for an overhaul of the bloc's privacy laws, under which data protection would be centrally regulated. But the idea faces opposition from some member states. The announcement on Tuesday means the investigations into the privacy policy could continue for months, during which time Google could continue to keep the system in place. ''It is essential regulators find a sanction that is not just a slap on the wrists and will make Google think twice before it ignores consumer rights again,'' said Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, a privacy advocacy group in Britain. Separately, Google this week announced plans to replace its director of privacy for product and engineering, Alma Whitten, who helped create the privacy policy. Lawrence You, who helped start the team, will take over. The privacy team at Google, which has 350 employees, was started in 2010 after two privacy blunders at the company involving improper data collection by Street View cars and Buzz, an ill-fated social networking tool. The privacy team does things like coach Google engineers on adding more privacy-friendly features to products, building tools like dashboards for Google users to control how their information is shared and making it more difficult for hackers to break into Gmail accounts. The company said that the retirement of Ms. Whitten, who is in her 40s, had been planned and was unrelated to the European Union news. ''Alma has done so much to improve our products and protect our users,'' Chris Gaither, a Google spokesman, said in a statement. ''The privacy and security teams, and everyone else at Google, will continue this hard work to ensure that our users' data is kept safe and secure.'' "
More Clients Ask Questions Of Bloomberg,"With new concerns emerging about practices at its news division, Bloomberg L.P., the sprawling financial services company founded by Michael R. Bloomberg, scrambled to shield its lucrative terminal business and appease nervous customers. The report on Friday that a Bloomberg reporter had used the company's financial data terminals to monitor a Goldman Sachs partner's logon activity has set off a ripple effect of inquiries from other worried subscribers, including JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department and the European Central Bank.  The revelations now stretch back to 2011, when UBS complained after a Bloomberg Television host alluded on air to his monitoring of the London-based rogue UBS trader Kweku Adoboli's terminal logon information to confirm his employment status at the bank. Then, last summer, executives at JPMorgan Chase questioned Bloomberg reporters' techniques after they were among the first to report on the trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale. ''I'm unaware of any record of a complaint from either bank on this issue,'' said Ty Trippet, a Bloomberg spokesman. The fallout continued on Monday. Bloomberg has now received roughly 20 inquiries about whether reporting practices violated the company's policies about getting access to subscriber information, including one from Bank of America. The bank also contacted Bloomberg to raise questions about the security of its employees' private information, people briefed on the matter said. Citigroup and other Wall Street banks have also contacted Bloomberg in recent days, according to these people, who spoke on the condition they not be identified discussing confidential conversations. The banks all declined to comment. In response, the company has been contacting subscribers. ''Since the news came out, my executive team and I have personally reached out to more than 300 clients,'' Daniel L. Doctoroff, chief executive of Bloomberg L.P., wrote in a blog post late Monday night. ''We started each conversation with an apology.'' A person briefed on those conversations said no one immediately canceled their subscription. Every Bloomberg user who logs onto a terminal is greeted with a screen that contains a letter from Mr. Doctoroff calling the practice a ''mistake'' and addressing privacy concerns. The company is preparing a blog where subscribers can discuss concerns about data security. Bloomberg subscribers pay on average about $20,000 a year to lease each terminal. Mr. Bloomberg, who stepped away from day-to-day operations when he became mayor, declined to comment on the situation at the company that bears his name. ''No, I can't say anything. I have an agreement with the Conflict of Interests Board,'' he said in a news conference on Monday. The company also began to discuss possible legal ramifications. While people close to the company doubted that clients would threaten legal action, Bloomberg hired outside lawyers on Friday to steer it through the crisis. The lawyers, according to the people close to the company, have assured Bloomberg that there is no basis for a lawsuit, since the subscribers did not suffer any damages and the information obtained was more trivial than confidential. An early analysis conducted by Bloomberg further suggested that reporters rarely, if ever, published stories based solely on information gleaned from the terminals. The people close to the company also noted that Bloomberg's sales agreement with subscribers disclosed that company employees had access to certain private information. While the agreement did not specify that Bloomberg News reporters were among those with access, the journalists are technically employees of Bloomberg L.P. But some bank executives said the snooping could have violated a common confidentiality clause in their contracts with Bloomberg. In the clause, Bloomberg promises to keep large swaths of information ''in confidence,'' meaning that it won't be shared with ''third parties.'' One Wall Street executive, who asked not to be named because of a firm policy prohibiting employees from speaking to the media, said his company was involved in a sensitive situation last year and he now wondered if reporters were monitoring his activities. ''Looking to see who is in or not is sleazy but hardly earthshaking,'' he said. ''But if they knew what stocks I was clicking on and what yields I was looking at, that is spying.'' (Bloomberg officials have repeatedly said the functions used by reporters did not provide information on specific trades or securities.) Another top Wall Street executive, who also asked not to be named, said although he did not know if his firm would take action, he planned to raise this issue with his board. ''I don't like it when something happens that hasn't occurred to me, and this had not occurred to me,'' he said. ''I feel violated.'' After the UBS and JPMorgan Chase complaints, Matthew Winkler, editor in chief at Bloomberg News, instructed his chief of staff, Reto Gregori, to make sure the newsroom's use of a function called UUID had been cut off, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Mr. Trippet denied that Mr. Winkler had made that request. The UUID function allowed reporters to view a specific subscriber's contact information, when the subscriber had last logged on and to monitor chats between subscribers and customer service representatives. But some reporters continued to use the function until last month, when Goldman Sachs executives contacted Mr. Doctoroff directly to complain. ''Last month, we immediately changed our policy so that reporters now have no greater access to information than our customers have,'' Mr. Winkler wrote in an editorial on Sunday. Bloomberg has at least 315,000 subscribers, and its proprietary terminals reign supreme on most traders' desks. But the business Mr. Bloomberg pioneered took a hit during the financial crisis of 2008. Even as Wall Street recovered, some financial institutions questioned the steep price of the terminals. The price tag, combined with the breach of privacy accusations, have aggravated tensions between Bloomberg and its subscribers, several Wall Street executives said. The concerns also presented a rare opportunity for Bloomberg's competitors to challenge the behemoth. Top executives at Interactive Brokers, an electronic brokerage firm that offers data services, met on Monday to discuss whether they should take additional steps to protect the privacy of clients. Thomas Peterffy, the firm's chief executive, also saw an opportunity to pitch his data to Bloomberg clients angered over the recent breach. ''It's good from our point of view,'' Mr. Peterffy said. ''Some people might want to look around for other options.'' What is more, a report in The Financial Times that a former Bloomberg employee had leaked online thousands of messages from a single day in 2009 and a week in 2010 between terminal subscribers threatened to further fray trust between Bloomberg and the hedge funds, investment banks and money managers who use the service. A Bloomberg spokesman said if The Financial Times report was true and the former employee had posted the messages, they would have been collected only in cooperation with clients to improve their technology. The Wall Street executive who expressed concerns over being spied upon by Bloomberg said the price the company charged for service added insult to injury. ''They pretty much have a monopoly,'' he said. ''I am fed up and now they do this. I honestly would pay as much for three-quarters of the data just to get away from them.'' "
Lawmakers Mostly Defend Surveillance,"Senator Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a defender of the phone and Internet surveillance programs that have come into public view in recent days, said on Sunday that she would consider holding hearings about them. ''I'm open to doing a hearing every month, if that's necessary,'' she said on the ABC program ''This Week.''  But, she added, ''Here's the rub: the instances where this has produced good -- has disrupted plots, prevented terrorist attacks, is all classified, that's what's so hard about this.'' Ms. Feinstein's remarks came two days after President Obama commented on news reports, based on leaked government documents, that revealed details about the surveillance programs run by the National Security Agency. The president said he welcomed a debate over the right balance between security and privacy. Other lawmakers who appeared on the Sunday talk shows were largely supportive of the surveillance programs, often outspokenly so. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said he was not bothered by the surveillance. He said on the CNN program ''State of the Union'' that the threat of terrorism was growing steadily amid turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa, but that further Congressional and executive review of the programs was ''entirely appropriate.'' But Senator Mark Udall of Colorado, for years a vocal critic of the government's electronic surveillance programs, said he was not convinced that a program to collect huge amounts of information about Americans' phone calls had led to the foiling of any terrorism plots. He also called for a renewed debate over the Patriot Act, which authorizes much of the data collection. Mr. Udall, a Democrat and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, appeared to be distinguishing the results of that program -- which uses ''metadata'' associated with phone calls, including numbers called and the duration of conversations -- from those of the newly revealed Prism program, which analyzes data collected from foreigners who use Internet services like Facebook and Skype. Several officials have said Prism has been effective. ''It's unclear to me that we've developed any intelligence through the metadata program that has led to the disruption of plots that we couldn't have developed through other data and other intelligence,'' Mr. Udall said on the CNN program ''State of the Union.'' Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, spoke with barely disguised anger about Glenn Greenwald, whose articles in the newspaper The Guardian last week described the surveillance programs. He added: ''The National Security Agency does not listen to Americans' phone calls, and it is not reading Americans' e-mails. None of these programs allow that.'' Mr. Greenwald ''says that he's got it all and now is an expert on the program,'' Mr. Rogers said on the ABC program ''This Week.'' ''He doesn't have a clue how this thing works. Neither did the person who released just enough information to literally be dangerous.'' On Sunday, The Guardian identified the leaker as Edward Snowden, a 29-year-old technical assistant who has worked at the National Security Agency for the last four years as an employee for various defense contractors. He most recently worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, according to the newspaper, which said Mr. Snowden asked to be identified after being cited anonymously in earlier reports. Before Mr. Snowden was identified, Mr. Rogers said of the leaker: ''I absolutely think they should be prosecuted.'' Ms. Feinstein, Democrat of California, said she agreed. One lawmaker, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, called the surveillance programs unconstitutional and said he would organize a class-action lawsuit against the government through Internet and phone companies. ''If we get 10 million Americans saying we don't want our phone records looked at, then somebody will wake up and say things will change in Washington,'' he said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' Ms. Feinstein cited two declassified cases in which electronic surveillance data had been used against terrorism suspects, in one case before a plot was carried out: that of David C. Headley, an American who scouted targets in Mumbai, India, in preparation for a deadly attack there, and that of Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan immigrant who pleaded guilty to plotting to set off backpacks full of explosives in the New York subway. The Mumbai attack killed more than 160 people; the subway attack was foiled. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Data Mining, Without Big Brother","Leonard H. Schrank was the chief executive of Swift from 1992 to 2007. Juan C. Zarate, a former assistant Treasury secretary, is the author of the forthcoming book ''Treasury's War: The Unleashing of a New Era of Financial Warfare.'' IN the wake of revelations about the National Security Agency's surveillance programs, President Obama has acknowledged the imperative to balance privacy and security. But so far, his administration's defense of the programs has failed to assure the public that this balance has been achieved -- or that basic privacy rights and civil liberties are being protected. Now that these programs have been leaked, Americans need to decide what this balance should look like. How do we devise a program that can allow the intelligence community to use big data and the latest technology to prevent terrorist attacks while ensuring we have not created a Big Brother state? In other words, how can we trust but verify?  We know because we've done it before. In 2006, this newspaper revealed the existence of the classified Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, which was developed and overseen by the United States Treasury. T.F.T.P. was, and still is, run by the Treasury Department using information subpoenaed from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. During the program's first few years, one of us headed Swift; the other helped oversee T.F.T.P. at Treasury. Swift is an industry-owned, global-financial-messaging system based in Brussels. Its transmissions carry financial messages for most of the world's banks across borders. Swift's data show who is transferring money, how much, and to whom, and contains specific identifier information. Soon after 9/11, Treasury began to subpoena Swift's data to allow government analysts to track the movement of terrorist funds. The Swift system doesn't contain private bank account information. But if a terrorist financier in one country were sending funds to a terrorist in another, it would be in the data of subpoenaed Swift messages. The sender's and receiver's names and bank account information would also be in the message. From the start, privacy and civil liberties protections were central to the program. Unlike the N.S.A., we assumed it would eventually have to endure public scrutiny -- in America and abroad. Given the importance and confidentiality of its data, Swift demanded that the government's access be targeted and limited, preventing broad data-mining but allowing focused searches and analysis to prevent terrorist attacks. Searches for any other purpose were forbidden. Both the Treasury and Swift ensured that the constraints on the information retrieved and used by analysts were strictly enforced. Outside auditors hired by Swift confirmed the limited scope of use, and Swift's own representatives (called ''scrutineers'') had authority to stop access to the data at any time if there was a concern that the restrictions were being breached. These independent monitors worked on site at government agencies and had real-time access to the system. Every time an analyst queried the system, the scrutineer could immediately review the query. Each query had to have a reason attached to it that justified it as a counterterrorism matter. Over time, the scope of data requested and retained was reduced. This confirmed that the information was being used in the way we said it was -- to save lives. When European data privacy advocates and politicians objected to the program, the eminent French counterterrorism judge Jean-Louis Burguière was assigned to review the program in detail for the European Parliament. He reported in 2008, and again in 2010, that Treasury had complied with civil liberties protections. The program was also highly effective. The financial intelligence it provided helped thwart terrorist attacks in America, Germany, Spain and Britain. Information gleaned from Swift databases provided thousands of leads -- including ones that helped capture Al Qaeda's principal representative in Southeast Asia and uncover a terrorist-financing network in New York City and Pakistan. The use of the data was legal, limited, targeted, overseen and audited. The program set a gold standard for how to protect the confidential data provided to the government. Treasury legally gained access to large amounts of Swift's financial-messaging data (which is the banking equivalent of telephone metadata) and eventually explained it to the public at home and abroad. It could remain a model for how to limit the government's use of mass amounts of data in a world where access to information is necessary to ensure our security while also protecting privacy and civil liberties. The Times' revelation did damage to the effectiveness of the program while ignoring the innovations that balanced security and civil liberties. The debate over T.F.T.P. was in many ways a precursor of today's debate about the N.S.A. To give American citizens confidence that their privacy isn't being violated today, the government must demonstrate that there is adequate oversight of the programs and that constraints on the use of N.S.A. data are being respected vigilantly. The private companies that are affected should be briefed on how their data is being used and given some say in how the programs are structured, limited and defended in public. It's possible that the government is already doing some of this -- but the people must be told. Ultimately, the Obama administration needs to demonstrate that the programs are not only valuable and legal, but also that the government's use of that data can be constrained and verified. "
Turning Off Tracking on the Internet,"To the Editor: Your July 21 editorial ''Don't Track Us'' got it exactly right -- Internet users who don't want their every move online to be tracked should have the right to prevent it. That's what Senator John D. Rockefeller IV's Do-Not-Track Online Act would do.  It will not mean the end of the Internet or of online advertising. It will simply give people what they want, as a recent survey by Consumer Action showed -- the ability to decide for themselves what happens with their personal information. SUSAN GRANT Director of Consumer Protection Consumer Federation of America Washington, July 24, 2013 The letter was also signed by representatives of Consumer Action, Consumer Watchdog, the American Civil Liberties Union, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, the Center for Digital Democracy and National Consumers League. To the Editor: Creating an Internet version of the ''do not call'' list, as you suggest, would require regulation resembling that for the United States' telecommunications market. That market is dominated by a small number of very large companies. Similarly, only the largest Internet advertising companies would have access to the data needed to cost-effectively compete and comply in the ''do not track'' environment you recommend. Tilting the vibrant, job-creating Internet ecosystem in the same direction would highly disadvantage consumers. Also, regulation is unnecessary when many companies already offer consumers tools that are free, easy to use and highly effective. My company's product, Ghostery, for example, enables consumers to see and even turn off any tracking from more than 1,300 companies. Privacy is inherently subjective. It's up to consumers, not the government, to decide what is acceptable, and what isn't. SCOTT MEYER New York, July 22, 2013 The writer, former general manager of nytimes.com, is chief executive of Evidon, a technology company. To the Editor: The national debate about privacy must be grounded in two fundamentals -- individual awareness and freedom to choose. With respect to advertising, your editorial applauds Web browsers for building privacy protections into their software. This is a ''Big Brother,'' ''we'll decide for you'' approach. To us, there could be nothing worse than robbing individuals of their right to choose in the purported name of privacy. Fortunately, there is a privacy-focused, robust program called the Digital Advertising Alliance privacy self-regulation program that puts the individual first. This program was born from an alliance of advertising interests that allows consumers to decide what to receive. Millions have taken advantage of this initiative. The White House applauded the advertising industry for a thoughtful, responsible program, which has just been extended to the mobile arena. Simply put, let's let the consumers decide for themselves what they want to see -- and ask the ''Big Brother'' Web browsers to step to the side. ROBERT LIODICE President and Chief Executive Association of National Advertisers New York, July 23, 2013 "
Warrantless Cellphone Tracking Is Upheld,"In a significant victory for law enforcement, a federal appeals court on Tuesday said that government authorities could extract historical location data directly from telecommunications carriers without a search warrant. The closely watched case, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, is the first ruling that squarely addresses the constitutionality of warrantless searches of historical location data stored by cellphone service providers. Ruling 2 to 1, the court said a warrantless search was ''not per se unconstitutional'' because location data was ''clearly a business record'' and therefore not protected by the Fourth Amendment. The ruling is likely to intensify legislative efforts, already bubbling in Congress and in the states, to consider measures to require warrants based on probable cause to obtain cellphone location data.  The appeals court ruling sharply contrasts with a New Jersey State Supreme Court opinion in mid-July that said the police required a warrant to track a suspect's whereabouts in real time. That decision relied on the New Jersey Constitution, whereas the ruling Tuesday in the Fifth Circuit was made on the basis of the federal Constitution. The Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on whether cellphone location data is protected by the Constitution. The case, which was initially brought in Texas, is not expected to go to the Supreme Court because it is ''ex parte,'' or filed by only one party -- in this case, the government. But the case could renew calls for the highest court to look at the issue, if another federal court rules differently on the same question. And two other federal cases involving this issue are pending. ''The opinion is clear that the government can access cell site records without Fourth Amendment oversight,'' said Orin Kerr, a constitutional law scholar at George Washington University Law School who filed an amicus brief in the case. For now, the ruling sets an important precedent: It allows law enforcement officials in the Fifth Circuit to chronicle the whereabouts of an American with a court order that falls short of a search warrant based on probable cause. ''This decision is a big deal,'' said Catherine Crump, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. ''It's a big deal and a big blow to Americans' privacy rights.'' The group reviewed records from more than 200 local police departments last year, concluding that the demand for cellphone location data had led some cellphone companies to develop ''surveillance fees'' to enable police to track suspects. In reaching its decision on Tuesday, the federal appeals court went on to agree with the government's contention that consumers knowingly give up their location information to the telecommunications carrier every time they make a call or send a text message on their cellphones. ''That means it is not protected by Fourth Amendment when the government goes to a third-party service provider and issues something that is not a warrant to demand production of those records,'' said Mark Eckenwiler, a former Justice Department lawyer who worked on the case and is now with the Washington law firm Perkins Coie. ''On this kind of historical cell site information, this is the first one to address the core constitutional question.'' Historical location data is crucial to law enforcement officials. Mr. Eckenwiler offered the example of drug investigations: A cellphone carrier can establish where a suspect met his supplier and how often he returned to a particular location. Likewise, location data can be vital in establishing people's habits and preferences, including whether they worship at a church or mosque or whether they are present at a political protest, which is why, civil liberties advocates say, it should be accorded the highest privileges of privacy protection. The decision could also bear implications for other government efforts to collect vast amounts of so-called metadata, under the argument that it constitutes ''business records,'' as in the National Security Agency's collection of Verizon phone records for millions of Americans. ''It provides support for the government's view that that procedure is constitutional, obtaining Verizon call records, because it holds that records are business records,'' said Mr. Kerr, of George Washington University. ''It doesn't make it a slam dunk but it makes a good case for the government to argue that position.'' An important element in Tuesday's ruling is the court's presumption of what consumers should know about the way cellphone technology works. ''A cell service subscriber, like a telephone user, understands that his cellphone must send a signal to a nearby cell tower in order to wirelessly connect his call,'' the court ruled, going on to note that ''contractual terms of service and providers' privacy policies expressly state that a provider uses a subscriber's location information to route his cellphone calls.'' In any event, the court added, the use of cellphones ''is entirely voluntary.'' The ruling also gave a nod to the way in which fast-moving technological advances have challenged age-old laws on privacy. Consumers today may want privacy over location records, the court acknowledged: ''But the recourse for these desires is in the market or the political process: in demanding that service providers do away with such records (or anonymize them) or in lobbying elected representatives to enact statutory protections.'' Cellphone privacy measures have been proposed in the Senate and House that would require law enforcement agents to obtain search warrants before prying open location records. Montana recently became the first state to require a warrant for location data. Maine soon followed. California passed a similar measure last year but Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, vetoed it, saying it did not strike what he called the right balance between the demands of civil libertarians and the police. "
House Votes to Bar I.R.S. Action on Health Law,"WASHINGTON -- In its last action before a five-week summer recess, the House took another jab at President Obama's health care law on Friday, voting to prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing or carrying out any provision of the law. The bill, approved by a vote of 232 to 185, now goes to the Senate, where it has virtually no chance of approval. President Obama said he would veto the measure if it got to him.  The House has now voted more than three dozen times to repeal or roll back some or all of the 2010 law, which is expected to provide coverage to 25 million people who lack health insurance. Under the law, the I.R.S. will play a key role. It will provide tax credits to low- and moderate-income people to help them buy private insurance. It can impose penalties on people who go without insurance and on larger employers that fail to offer coverage to full-time employees. Republicans said the tax agency could not be trusted. ''The I.R.S. has been abusing its power by targeting and punishing American citizens for their political beliefs,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader. ''This kind of government abuse must stop. The last thing we should do is to allow the I.R.S. to play such a central role in our health care.'' Under the law, Mr. Cantor said, the I.R.S. ''will have access to the American people's protected health care information.'' Privacy concerns are justified, he said, because ''this same agency has illegally disclosed protected taxpayer information.'' But Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said, ''Neither the I.R.S. nor the Department of Health and Human Services will have access to medical records or other personal history, no access whatsoever.'' Mr. Levin said that Republicans, in their zeal to undo the health care overhaul, were neglecting other important issues. ''This bill is nothing more than a continuation of the Republicans' blind obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act,'' Mr. Levin said. ''Their mission is to destroy, not implement, health care reform.'' Four Democrats -- Representatives John Barrow of Georgia, Jim Matheson of Utah, Mike McIntyre of North Carolina and Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota -- crossed party lines and voted for the bill. No Republicans voted against it. Separately, Mr. Obama came to the rescue of members of Congress and their aides on Friday, saying that the federal government would continue paying a large share of their health insurance premiums. Ambiguous provisions of the health care law had created serious doubts about whether such contributions would continue. Under the arrangement devised by the administration, lawmakers and aides who work in their personal offices will have to get coverage through new state-based markets known as insurance exchanges. Mr. Obama has said that he will get health insurance through an exchange. And the White House said Friday that he would support legislation putting cabinet officers and members of the White House staff into the marketplaces as well. Lawmakers and their aides, like many federal workers, generally receive coverage through the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The government pays roughly 70 percent of premiums, contributing $5,000 a year for individual coverage and $11,000 for family coverage under some of the most popular plans. The 2010 law generally requires lawmakers and thousands of their aides to get coverage through the exchanges. It does not provide any obvious way for the federal government to continue paying its share of the premiums. The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said that this provision of the law, aimed mainly at lawmakers, threatened ''collateral damage'' to staff members. ''Staff did tell me that there would be a problem,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''And it was a good opportunity for us to pay tribute to the staff and all that they mean to the workings of Congress. They are a tremendous intellectual resource. They could, shall we say, be better compensated financially outside. Happily they enjoy the psychic rewards of public service.'' Some aides, fearing the loss of federal contributions to their premiums, had begun to look for other jobs. The Office of Personnel Management, which administers health benefits for federal employees, will provide details of the new arrangement in a proposed regulation to be issued next week. Under the rule, a White House official said, members of Congress and certain Congressional employees ''will enroll in marketplace plans, will not qualify for premium tax credits, and, like private sector employees, will not lose their employer contributions for these health plans.'' The Obama administration has not said how it will calculate the employer contributions. Congressional aides were told that the contributions would be no more than what lawmakers and their aides currently receive under the federal employees health program. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said: ''Congress should live under the laws it creates. That includes Obamacare. And if the exchanges actually go into effect, Congress should pass a law to put White House and Congressional leadership in the exchanges.'' "
Surveillance Revelations Shake U.S.-German Ties,"BERLIN -- Continuing revelations, based on documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, of sweeping American digital surveillance around the world are rattling the close ties between the United States and Germany. In a country scarred by Nazi and Communist pasts, the issue is prompting not just a debate about privacy and data protection, but also demands from German officials that the Berlin-Washington security partnership be put on a new footing. The latest of the Snowden revelations came on Sunday, when the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel published a report, citing documents Mr. Snowden obtained while he worked as a contractor for the National Security Agency, that said the agency had succeeded in tapping into videoconferences at the United Nations in New York, into the European Union's mission to the United Nations, and into other diplomatic missions around the world. Evidence that the United States has been spying extensively on its allies as well as on its enemies has been among the most significant revelations from Mr. Snowden, along with widespread government surveillance of the telephone and digital communications of American citizens without warrants.  The Der Spiegel article on Sunday was not the first to reveal American eavesdropping at the United Nations, which many diplomats have assumed for years was taking place. But it added extensive new detail to what had previously been reported, and it may compound the frictions developing between the United States and its allies over the issue -- especially with Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is in the midst of an election campaign. Top German officials traveled to Washington this month to press an unusual demand: to negotiate a new formal agreement with the United States that neither side will spy on the other. The initiative was confirmed in two sittings of the German parliamentary committee in charge of overseeing the country's intelligence agencies. Ronald Pofalla, who runs Ms. Merkel's Chancellery, told the committee on Aug. 12 that the two countries were working on just such an agreement. He gave no details, and none leaked out afterward in German media reports. Neither side will say anything official about the proposed accord. Observers on both sides of the Atlantic say that even if such an agreement proves to be feasible, it will probably have to wait until after the German elections on Sept. 22. It was not known whether Der Spiegel planned to publish further revelations from Snowden documents before then. Opinion polls in Germany suggest that Ms. Merkel's strong standing with voters has not been damaged by the issue, nor has it displaced the weather or vacations as topics of summer conversation here. But in the eyes of a skeptical, privacy-minded German public, at least, Der Spiegel's report may have undercut the significance of the proposed accord by noting that the eavesdropping described in the Snowden documents would have violated agreements that the United States has made. The report said that the N.S.A. succeeded last year in cracking an encrypted video teleconferencing system at the United Nations, and even stumbled across Chinese spies who were apparently invading the same communications system. The magazine also published a floor plan, evidently from N.S.A. files, of the third floor of the European mission to the United Nations on Third Avenue in New York, showing the locations of offices and computer servers. Der Spiegel suggested that the spying on allies and the United Nations made President Obama's defense of surveillance programs as a counterterrorism effort seem misleading at best. For the German government, the whole affair is frustrating. One senior official who spoke on the condition of anonymity argued that Ms. Merkel had generally done a good job of keeping foreign affairs and controversy out of domestic politics, only to have Mr. Snowden's revelations capture world attention just as she was preparing to receive Mr. Obama in Berlin in June, depart on vacation in July and open the final stage of her election campaign in August. With Mr. Obama at her side on June 19, Ms. Merkel, who is said by several well-informed people to have very much wanted the president to come to Berlin before the election, kept the emphasis on cooperation. She cited a well-known instance in which a tip from American intelligence helped thwart a potential terrorist attack in Germany. By early July, however, United States-German ties were under strain once more, after Der Spiegel, citing documents obtained through Mr. Snowden, reported that American intelligence agencies regularly examined huge volumes of digital information traveling in and out of Germany. Exasperated officials on both sides lamented privately that security restrictions kept them from being able to offer more details to back up general reassurances that the German public was not under sweeping surveillance by the United States. Ms. Merkel sent at least two high-level delegations to Washington to press for the new accord. It seems that prompted Mr. Obama to say at his Aug. 9 news conference ''to others around the world'' that he wanted ''to make clear once again that America is not interested in spying on ordinary people.'' The weekly newspaper Die Zeit noted in its latest edition that the political storm in Germany appeared to be calming down, though Mr. Snowden continued to draw praise from respected figures like the writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger, who called him a ''hero of the 21st century'' in a television interview last week. But the same day, the British police detained David Miranda, the partner of Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who has been a main conduit for Mr. Snowden's revelations. The Guardian, which has published articles by Mr. Greenwald, then revealed that British intelligence agents had overseen the destruction of computer hard drives at the newspaper's offices. The two incidents ignited fresh outrage in Germany, where data protection laws are strict, and jealously guarded by officials and consumers alike. Journalists like Mathias Müller von Blumencron, a former editor of the online edition of Der Spiegel, and Stefan Schulz, of the online edition of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, said that the election campaign had blunted what could have been a more full-throated discussion of government surveillance, cooperation with the United States and the balance between civil rights and security needs in Western democracy. ''If we had had this discussion last year,'' with the elections less imminent, ''it could have been more fruitful,'' Mr. Schulz said. Germany's privacy laws and public sensitivity to privacy issues have made it an attractive base for hacker activists like Jacob Appelbaum and for Laura Poitras, the documentary filmmaker who helped bring Mr. Greenwald and Mr. Snowden together. A political movement called the Pirate Party won seats in Parliament in 2011 on a platform focused on Internet freedom. Mr. Schulz noted that groups like the Pirate Party and the Chaos Computer Club in Berlin had been talking for years about the technical possibility of widespread government surveillance in Germany. And the German news media questioned the wisdom of The Guardian in allowing the authorities into its offices. Something is wrong, Die Zeit argued in an editorial, when a country like Britain -- whose closeness to the United States has been stressed in coverage of the affair -- forgets the difference between journalism and terrorism. While the debate has continued, Ms. Merkel has been out campaigning. At a stop Friday evening in the Ruhr-area town of Recklinghausen, a group of about 40 jeering Pirate Party members waved a large banner proclaiming that ''citizens' rights are not negotiable'' and saying ''never again a surveillance state!'' ''We hope we got more attention for our concerns,'' said Claudia Steimann, 40, a Pirate activist. ''The chancellor almost never says anything about politics, or what she wants to do.'' Certainly Ms. Merkel's main opponents, the Social Democrats, have found it hard to make hay of the Snowden affair. One of their leaders, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, had Mr. Profalla's job running the Chancellery in 2002 when German and American agencies tightened their cooperation after the Sept. 11 attacks, which were planned partly on German soil. Mr. Steinmeier was later foreign minister in Ms. Merkel's first coalition government. Peer Steinbrück, her current challenger, was finance minister in that same cabinet. "
Acxiom Lets Consumers See Data It Collects,"Aboutthedata.com, a Web site introduced on Wednesday by a leading marketing technology firm called the Acxiom Corporation, is offering individual consumers a glimpse of some of the details the company has collected about them. Visitors who log in to the site may review many seemingly innocuous facts, such as whether someone in their household owns a dog or a cat, or is interested in jogging or biking. Aboutthedata.com delivers a soothing message about Acxiom, a data broker that collects, stores, analyzes and sells billions of pieces of information about consumers with the aim of helping corporate clients like banks, insurers and retailers aim marketing pitches at specific audience segments.  ''We have come to expect companies will make their interactions with us personal,'' the site says. ''We no longer want to receive mass marketing -- getting bombarded with ads that have no relevancy to our lives.'' Yet critics say the new consumer site omits so many details about Acxiom's data-gathering and analysis practices that it sanitizes the data mining behind data-driven marketing. Aboutthedata.com, at least in its initial incarnation, leaves out many data elements that Acxiom markets to its corporate clients -- intimate details like whether a person is a ''potential inheritor'' or an ''adult with senior parent,'' or whether a household has a ''diabetic focus'' or ''senior needs.'' Without a more complete picture of industry practices, privacy advocates say, consumers cannot make informed decisions about whether to share personal information with companies. ''It does not give an accurate picture of how this works,'' Jeff Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer group in Washington, said of Aboutthedata.com. ''The language is so innocuous that the average consumer would think there's no privacy concern.'' Acxiom executives said that the initial version of the site included what it considered its core data about consumers, but that they planned to add information categories to the site on a regular basis. For the last several years, members of Congress and federal regulators have been pressing the data brokerage industry to make its practices more transparent. Much of their criticism has focused on Acxiom, an industry leader that has amassed information on the financial means, residential status and shopping habits of a majority of adults in the United States. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report on consumer privacy that recommended that Congress pass a law requiring greater transparency for data brokers. Unlike consumer reporting agencies, which are required by federal law to give consumers free copies of their credit reports and allow them to correct errors, companies that collect marketing data are not required to show consumers information that has been collected about them. Some regulators have warned that the industry's data-mining could be used for discriminatory practices -- such as offering elite consumers better pricing or identifying financially troubled consumers who might be susceptible to predatory lending. Now the new site positions Acxiom as the industry leader in responding to regulators' concerns. Julie Brill, a member of the F.T.C., described the Acxiom site as ''a first step down this important road towards greater transparency.'' In addition to allowing consumers to view their records or to opt out of Acxiom's marketing databases, the site lets them change individual data elements in their files. Scott E. Howe, the chief executive of Acxiom, based in Little Rock, Ark., said in an interview last week that the company wanted to give consumers greater control over their data. ''The whole role of the consumer as another voice in the equation hasn't been heard effectively by folks who deal in data until now,'' Mr. Howe said. If consumers en masse correct or update their Acxiom files, the company would benefit by being able to offer its corporate clients better-quality data, he said. But, he said, it could be a problem if consumers opt out in large numbers. Aboutthedata.com received mixed reviews on its opening day. Some consumers, privacy advocates and data security specialists said that they had trouble logging in, or logged in only to find that no information was available about them. Some criticized the site's identity verification system -- which requires name, address, date of birth and the last four digits of the Social Security number -- as insufficiently secure. Others noted that, while consumers could opt out of Acxiom's marketing database, they were not given the opportunity to opt out of every Acxiom product. ''Consumers are not fully in control of their information until they can request Acxiom permanently delete their data and prevent the company from using their information for purposes other than marketing,'' said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who last year opened an investigation into data brokers including Acxiom. ''I plan to continue my oversight and investigation into the data broker industry to make sure Americans know how this industry operates and consumers have power over their own information.'' But mostly critics faulted the site for promoting data-driven marketing without explicitly describing some of Acxiom's more sophisticated consumer-tracking techniques. In marketing materials, for instance, Acxiom describes one of its products, called AbiliTec Digital, as a data-powered ''customer recognition'' service that helps companies link a customer's history with his or her name, nickname, e-mail address, home address, and mobile and landline phone numbers. While that kind of pervasive surveillance may be useful for companies, it could also make consumers more vulnerable to pitches for products that are not necessarily good for them, said Ryan Calo, an assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Law who studies consumer privacy. In a recent research paper on industry practices, he imagined a hypothetical obese consumer who tries to avoid snacking but receives an ad on his mobile phone from the nearest doughnut shop exactly when he is least likely to resist. ''That is a dangerous direction,'' Mr. Calo said, ''because it starts to figure out what makes each of us vulnerable.'' "
French Condemn Surveillance By N.S.A.,"PARIS -- The French government castigated the United States on Monday for carrying out extensive electronic eavesdropping within France, the latest diplomatic backlash against the National Security Agency's wide surveillance net and another example of how disclosures about the program have strained relations -- at least temporarily -- with even the closest of Washington's allies. The Foreign Ministry summoned the American ambassador, Charles H. Rivkin, who met with ministry officials after an article on Monday in Le Monde, the authoritative French newspaper, said that the N.S.A. had scooped up 70 million digital communications inside France in a single month, from Dec. 10, 2012, to Jan. 8, 2013. French officials called the spying ''totally unacceptable'' and demanded that it cease.  ''These kinds of practices between partners are totally unacceptable, and we must be assured that they are no longer being implemented,'' Mr. Rivkin was told, according to a ministry spokesman, Alexandre Giorgini. The same language was used late Monday in a statement from President François Hollande describing what he had said in an earlier telephone conversation with President Obama. However, in a discreet signal that some of the French talk may have been aimed at the government's domestic audience, France did not call this episode a breach of sovereignty, as Brazil did last month after similar revelations. During his call to Mr. Hollande, Mr. Obama assured him that the United States was working to balance the privacy concerns that ''all people share'' with the ''legitimate security concerns'' of American citizens, according to a statement from the State Department. The disclosures in France were based on secret documents provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor whose decision to leak information about the surveillance programs has set off a global debate on the balance between security and privacy in the digital age. On Sunday, Der Spiegel, a German newsmagazine, reported that the N.S.A. had intercepted communications inside the cabinet of the former Mexican president Felipe Calderón. Previous disclosures from the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden had already pulled the veil off N.S.A. spying on other allies, including Germany, Britain and Brazil. In June, Der Spiegel reported that the agency had eavesdropped on European Union offices in Brussels and Washington. Probably the most serious diplomatic breach was the revelation in September that the N.S.A. had intercepted the communications of the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff. Brazil termed the spying ''an unacceptable violation of sovereignty.'' The French newspaper article on Monday was written by Glenn Greenwald, an American journalist whose articles have conveyed most of the Snowden revelations published so far, and a Le Monde correspondent. The French interior minister, Manuel Valls, speaking on Europe 1 Radio, called the disclosures ''shocking'' and said they would ''require explanation.'' Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Paris on Monday for talks on a possible peace process for Syria and discussions on Iran's nuclear program. Asked about the spying at a news conference here, Mr. Kerry emphasized the security challenges in combating terrorism, saying it was an ''every day,'' ''24/7'' problem. He added: ''We in the U.S. are currently reviewing the way that we gather intelligence. And I think that is appropriate.'' The article did not make entirely clear what the N.S.A. had swept up. But it appeared that the agency had taken a vacuum-cleaner approach, recording 70 million communications, the article said, including telephone calls and instant messages. It was not clear how many of those were listened to or read. The article also noted that the interceptions were obtained using codes with the names ''Drtbox'' and ''Whitebox,'' with the vast majority having been gotten with the ''Whitebox'' code. However, it was not clear what those codes meant, or why the time frame was limited to a single month. Le Monde went on to say the documents indicated that in addition to tracking communications between people suspected of having links to terrorism, the N.S.A. surveillance program might have targeted communications involving prominent figures in business, politics or the French administration. Last summer, Mr. Hollande criticized the American program, saying France ''could not accept this kind of behavior between partners and allies.'' However, many observers both then and now suggested that the French government's harsh tone was in part political theater rather than genuine outrage because France runs its own version of a spying program on the Americans, which came to light in 2010. At that time, a previous White House director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, tried to put in place a written agreement pledging that neither country would spy on the other's soil -- similar to the ''gentleman's agreement'' that the United States has with Britain. The deal fell through in part because some members of both countries' intelligence communities wanted to continue to spy on each other, said officials close to those negotiations. In addition, the facts of the N.S.A. data collection in Europe have been known for months, which led two nonprofit groups that oppose the spying to describe it as ''astonishing'' and ''cowardly'' that the French government would portray itself as not knowing about the surveillance. It also became clear over the summer that France's espionage agency, the General Directorate for External Security, carried out data collection on French citizens without clear legal authority, suggesting that although the technology used by the United States may be more sophisticated, electronic eavesdropping as an antiterrorism and anticrime tool is broadly practiced. Mr. Giorgini of the Foreign Ministry said Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius would discuss the issue with Mr. Kerry when the two met on Tuesday, although the main purpose of the meeting was to talk about the Middle East and Iran. The report of spying by the United States starting in 2010 on Mexico's president at the time, Mr. Calderón, brought condemnation from Mexico's Foreign Ministry. ''This practice is unacceptable, illegitimate and contrary to Mexican and international law,'' said a statement issued Sunday, which went on to say the government would send a diplomatic note to the United States seeking an explanation. ''In a relationship between neighbors and partners, there is no place for the kind of activities that allegedly took place,'' the statement said. Previous Snowden documents disclosed that the N.S.A. had tapped into the e-mail of Enrique Peña Nieto, in June 2012, a month before he won election as Mexico's president. He took office in December, when Mr. Calderón left for a fellowship at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Mr. Peña Nieto said last month that Mr. Obama had assured him an investigation would be conducted into the allegation and penalties imposed on any wrongdoing at the agency. In general, though, the issue has not inflamed passions in Mexico, where political rivals often spy on one another and the United States is often viewed as an omnipotent, inevitable force. Mr. Calderón allowed American law enforcement and intelligence agencies to forge close bonds with Mexico's security forces in an effort to fight drug gangs and organized crime. The assistance included American aid to develop telephone and e-mail tapping and a high-tech intelligence center to track criminals. A spokesman for Mr. Calderón would not comment. "
Spain Summons American Ambassador on New Reports of N.S.A. Spying,"MADRID -- The Spanish government on Monday summoned the American ambassador to address allegations that the National Security Agency had recently collected data on 60 million telephone calls in Spain.  Adding to a spying scandal that includes Brazil, France, Germany and Mexico, the government's move came after two Spanish newspapers reported Monday that the agency had gathered data on phone numbers and locations but had not monitored the contents of the calls. After his meeting with Spanish officials, the ambassador, James Costos, issued a statement in which he acknowledged Spain's worries about the surveillance programs and said, ''Ultimately, the United States needs to balance the important role that these programs play in protecting our national security and protecting the security of our allies with legitimate privacy concerns.'' Mr. Costos did not discuss the details of the spying claims, nor did the Spanish government after the meeting, which lasted less than an hour. Instead, Iñigo Méndez de Vigo, a Spanish secretary of state, referred in a separate statement to the need to maintain ''a necessary balance'' between security and privacy concerns. Spain, he added, is calling on Washington to clarify ''the reach of measures that, if proven to be true, are improper and unacceptable between partners and friendly countries.'' The two Spanish newspapers, El Mundo and El País, based their reporting on documents viewed by Glenn Greenwald, an American journalist, that were provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who has been at the center of the spying scandal. The newspapers said the data covered information relating to about 60 million Spanish phone calls and was collected between December and early January. The spying scandal, which has strained relations between Washington and some of its most important allies, has recently focused on whether the N.S.A. targeted the cellphone of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The Spanish government has so far declined to discuss whether it has evidence that Washington spied on Spanish government officials. ''Spying activities aren't proper among partner countries and allies,'' Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, said at a news conference last week in Brussels, where he was attending a meeting of European Union leaders. Last year, Spain agreed to extend an American lease of military facilities on its territory, including the Rota naval base, where the United States is planning to station Aegis antimissile vessels as part of the European defense shield of NATO. "
States Take On Privacy,"Tired of waiting for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation, state lawmakers are taking matters into their own hands, and not a moment too soon. Legislatures across the country have enacted laws to regulate the kinds of information that companies and law enforcement agencies can collect about individuals and how it can be done.  Businesses ranging from social networking services to little-known data brokers collect all kinds of information about consumers, often without their knowledge or permission. The data includes basic details like what websites people visit, what they purchase online and in retail stores and whom they interact with. The information is most commonly used to help businesses deliver targeted ads, but it can also be amassed into detailed profiles for purchase by anybody, including potential employers. In Washington, lobbyists from technology, marketing and related industries have effectively put the brakes on privacy protection legislation. Lawmakers have done nothing to advance a consumer privacy bill of rights that President Obama proposed in 2012, which would have allowed consumers to restrict the data collected and required businesses to give individuals access to files about them. And despite the Federal Trade Commission's support for a ''do-not track'' option on Internet browsers that could prevent advertisers from monitoring consumers online, it has not been implemented. This is why more than 10 states have passed more than two dozen state privacy laws just this year, as reported in The Times by Somini Sengupta. Texas passed a bill that would force police to get a warrant to look at emails -- a similar federal bill was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in April but has not come to a vote in the Senate. California made it illegal to publish the nude pictures of someone online without his or her consent. Other states have restricted the use of drones for surveillance. Industry officials complain that these state efforts are creating a patchwork of rules that will be hard for companies to satisfy, in part because it's not easy to tailor websites to comply with state-specific rules that might even contradict one another in some cases. Some of the laws might be hard to carry out, but if that turns out to be the case, the technology and advertising industries have only themselves to blame. By stalling legislation in Congress, they have essentially invited state lawmakers to take up the cause of consumers, who are increasingly worried about privacy. The response of businesses to this trend has been to increase lobbying in state capitols to kill or water down privacy bills. If these industries are actually interested in uniform rules for the entire country, here is a suggestion: Stop obstructing legislation in Washington, and sit down with lawmakers and consumer advocates to come up with effective federal laws. "
Insurers Seek Ways To Bypass Healthcare.gov,"Some major health insurers are so worried about the Obama administration's ability to fix its troubled health care website that they are pushing the government to create a shortcut that would allow them to enroll people entitled to subsidies directly rather than through the federal system. The idea is only one of several being discussed in a frantic effort to find a way around the technological problems that teams of experts are urgently trying to resolve. So far, the administration has resisted the idea, partly because of concerns about giving insurance companies access to personal data. People familiar with the matter said no such modifications are planned, and even some insurers are not holding out much hope. But senior White House officials said the administration was open to ways in which insurers could handle more enrollments and had stepped up efforts to make that possible because of the technical problems with the site.  ''It was something we were always doing,'' one official said, but it is ''of additional value now.'' In a statement, Chris Jennings, a senior health care adviser to President Obama, said the administration was ''continuing to pursue additional avenues by which people can enroll, such as direct enrollment through insurance companies, that will help meet pent-up demand.'' In proposing the idea, the insurers said a bypass giving them direct access to the federal platform that determines a consumer's eligibility for a subsidy would alleviate the traffic on the website, healthcare.gov, and provide more breathing room to fix complicated technical problems that threaten to persist beyond a crucial, self-imposed Dec. 1 deadline. But even if such a shortcut could be designed, federal officials are concerned about protecting personal data, such as confidential financial and tax information and immigration status. The security and privacy issues are likely to overshadow any possible compromise, according to people briefed on the discussions. A more likely solution is for consumers to be able to work directly with an insurer to estimate their qualifications for a subsidy, leaving federal verification to a later date, some insurers said. Insurance executives declined to speak on the record because of company policies and concerns about alienating political officials. Time is running out. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, has promised to have the website's technical problems largely solved by the end of the month. But inside the White House, there is increasing anxiety that the troubled rollout of the health care site could imperil the remainder of Mr. Obama's presidency. Aside from the direct enrollment option, insurers and federal officials are examining other ways in the coming weeks to sign up the millions of Americans looking for health insurance. However, none of the options represent a quick fix. One idea being considered would allow people to enroll before the paperwork is completed. At the extreme, despite strong resistance from the insurance industry, there is even talk of extending the deadline for obtaining insurance on the exchanges by months. Consumers must now enroll by Dec. 15 for insurance coverage that would begin Jan. 1. The open enrollment period is to end on March 31. The main stumbling block for some consumers is the need to determine their eligibility for subsidies, and the amount. Insurance companies can now only estimate the amount for them. It is up the government to verify eligibility, using personal financial information from tax returns and the like. ''The question is, can they create a separate direct pathway so consumers can get that information on their subsidies?'' asked one industry official. ''If they don't have Healthcare?.gov up and running by the end of the month, direct enrollment is critical.'' The other option, allowing consumers to obtain their own estimates, seems more palatable. It is unclear whether that proposal is possible. Insurers are worried that they will have offered coverage to individuals whose actual subsidies are less than they have estimated, potentially leaving the insurers or the people themselves financially exposed. ''I think there are potential work-arounds,'' said an executive of a major insurer. ''I think we have some leeway here so long as people are not in a situation where individuals have to pay significantly more than expected or plans end up in a position with cash-flow issues.'' Insurers are opposed to the idea of extending the enrollment period. They say it encourages people to wait to sign up, particularly the young and the healthy, an age group that insurers need to balance the cost of insuring people with expensive health conditions. They are also worried about the effect of the delay on their ability to price plans for 2015. By all accounts, the administration is making an enormous effort to rescue the website. The appointment of Quality Software Services late last month as the project's general contractor has established a sense of order amid chaos. Henry Chao, the technology official from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, who had managed the project since its infancy, has been sidelined, people involved in the effort said. Specialists say software engineers now have a clear set of priorities and are steadily crossing items off a three-tier list for repairs. On Friday, Jeffrey D. Zients, the administration's point man on fixing Healthcare.gov, said ''a couple dozen'' high-priority fixes would be made over the weekend. He repeatedly declined to say how many critical fixes had been identified, saying the list continually changes. ''We are making progress across those priority items, and the site is getting better each week, and will be at the standard that we set for the end of the month,'' Mr. Zients said. Specialists said that most of the effort so far had been focused on eliminating the delays and timeouts that have so frustrated consumers trying to shop for and enroll in plans. More challenging, one person said, are the repairs to the more complex, invisible part of the system that draws information from various federal and state databases into a central base to determine eligibility and subsidies and confirms enrollment data. The technological effort cited by the White House, that person said, is actually a swell of software engineers. Red Hat, which makes Linux operating systems, and the database giant Oracle, already had sent specialists to help out. Quality Software has assigned one senior engineer, from Google, to edit website software fixes, he said. Some software engineers on the job have been replaced simply because they were too burned out to continue the late-night schedule. ''A lot of the stuff people are doing now is going through the checklists they should have gone through before Oct. 1,'' one specialist said. On the two floors at an office building in suburban Virginia, visible evidence of President Obama's promised new ''tech surge'' is slight. About 350 employees are hunkered over their computers -- roughly 70 more than last month -- trying to repair Healthcare.gov. Several White House technology fellows, young enough to be mistaken by some as students, have taken over one office. Another change, said one person closely involved in the repair effort: ''A lot of suits are walking around.'' The scene at the office building, for one of the two main contractors that built the troubled website, illustrates the bind in which the Obama administration now finds itself. Despite the White House's suggestions that a cavalry from the Silicon Valley has arrived to save the day, specialists say that the online system cannot be fixed by adding manpower. Some experts argue that an influx of software engineers at this stage would slow down, not speed up, the repair effort. ''If you have got nine women that doesn't mean you can have a baby in a month,'' said Frederick P. Brooks, a computer science professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and one of the world's leading authorities on software development. Rather, he and others said, fixing the system involves a painstaking slog through line after line of software code. No one at this point can be certain how many fixes need to be made, specialists said, because some fixes expose new problems. "
C.I.A. Collects Global Data On Transfers Of Money,"WASHINGTON -- The Central Intelligence Agency is secretly collecting bulk records of international money transfers handled by companies like Western Union -- including transactions into and out of the United States -- under the same law that the National Security Agency uses for its huge database of Americans' phone records, according to current and former government officials. The C.I.A. financial records program, which the officials said was authorized by provisions in the Patriot Act and overseen by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, offers evidence that the extent of government data collection programs is not fully known and that the national debate over privacy and security may be incomplete. Some details of the C.I.A. program were not clear. But it was confirmed by several current and former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter is classified.  The data does not include purely domestic transfers or bank-to-bank transactions, several officials said. Another, while not acknowledging the program, suggested that the surveillance court had imposed rules withholding the identities of any Americans from the data the C.I.A. sees, requiring a tie to a terrorist organization before a search may be run, and mandating that the data be discarded after a certain number of years. The court has imposed several similar rules on the N.S.A. call logs program. Several officials also said more than one other bulk collection program has yet to come to light. ''The intelligence community collects bulk data in a number of different ways under multiple authorities,'' one intelligence official said. Dean Boyd, a spokesman for the C.I.A., declined to confirm whether such a program exists, but said that the agency conducts lawful intelligence collection aimed at foreign -- not domestic -- activities and that it is subject to extensive oversight. ''The C.I.A. protects the nation and upholds the privacy rights of Americans by ensuring that its intelligence collection activities are focused on acquiring foreign intelligence and counterintelligence in accordance with U.S. laws,'' he said. Juan Zarate, a White House and Treasury official under President George W. Bush, said that unlike telecommunications information, there has generally been less sensitivity about the collection of financial data, in part because the government already collects information on large transactions under the Bank Secrecy Act. ''There is a longstanding legal baseline for the U.S. government to collect financial information,'' said Mr. Zarate, who is also the author of ''Treasury's War,'' about the crackdown on terrorist financing. He did not acknowledge the C.I.A. program. Orders for business records from the surveillance court generally prohibit recipients from talking about them. A spokeswoman for one large company that handles money transfers abroad, Western Union, did not directly address a question about whether it had been ordered to turn over records in bulk, but said that the company complies with legal requirements to provide information. ''We collect consumer information to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and other laws,'' said the spokeswoman, Luella Chavez D'Angelo. ''In doing so, we also protect our consumers' privacy.'' In recent months, there have been hints in congressional testimony, declassified documents and litigation that the N.S.A. program -- which was disclosed by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor -- is not unique in collecting records involving Americans. For example, the American Civil Liberties Union is fighting a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for documents related to Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the provision that allows the government to compel companies to turn over business records for counterterrorism purposes. After the government declassified the N.S.A. phone records program, it has released many documents about it in response to the suit. But the government has notified the A.C.L.U. that it is withholding two Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court rulings invoking Section 215 -- one dated Aug. 20, 2008, and the other Nov. 23, 2010 -- because they discuss matters that remain classified, according to Alexander Abdo, an A.C.L.U. lawyer. ''It suggests very strongly that there are other programs of surveillance that the public has a right to know about,'' Mr. Abdo said. In addition, a Justice Department ''white paper'' on the N.S.A.'s call records program, released in August, said that communications logs are ''a context'' in which the ''collection of a large volume of data'' is necessary for investigators to be able to analyze links between terrorism suspects and their associates. It did not say that call records are the only context that meets the criteria for bulk gathering. In hearings on Capitol Hill, government officials have repeatedly avoided saying that phone logs -- which include date, duration and numbers of phone calls, but not their content -- are the only type of data that would qualify for bulk collection under the Patriot Act provision. In a little-noticed exchange late in an Oct. 3 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the N.S.A. director, appeared to go further. At the hearing, Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, asked General Alexander and James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, a sweeping question: ''So what are all of the programs run by the N.S.A. or other federal agencies'' that used either Section 215 of the Patriot Act or another surveillance law that allows warrantless wiretapping of phone and emails? General Alexander responded by describing, once again, the N.S.A.'s call records program, adding, ''None of that is hid from you.'' Mr. Clapper said nothing. Then, moments later, General Alexander interjected that he was talking only about what the N.S.A. is doing under the Patriot Act provision and appearing to let slip that other agencies are operating their own programs. ''You know, that's of course a global thing that others use as well, but for ours, it's just that way,'' General Alexander said. In September, the Obama administration declassified and released a lengthy opinion by Judge Claire Eagan of the surveillance court, written a month earlier and explaining why the panel had given legal blessing to the call log program. A largely overlooked passage of her ruling suggested that the court has also issued orders for at least two other types of bulk data collection. Specifically, Judge Eagan noted that the court had previously examined the issue of what records are relevant to an investigation for the purpose of ''bulk collections,'' plural. There followed more than six lines that were censored in the publicly released version of her opinion. Lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have been trying to gain more information about other bulk collection programs. In September, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin and an author of the original Patriot Act, sent a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. asking if the administration was collecting bulk records aside from the phone data. An aide said he had yet to get a response. Even lawmakers on the Intelligence Committees have indicated that they are not sure they understand the entire landscape of what the government is doing in terms of bulk collection. Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, recently sent a classified letter to Mr. Clapper asking for a full accounting of every other national security program that involves bulk collection of data at home or abroad, according to government officials.

Justices Reject Challenge to N.S.A. Program,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Monday turned away an unusual challenge to a National Security Agency surveillance program. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed the challenge directly with the Supreme Court, arguing that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had ''exceeded its statutory jurisdiction when it ordered production of millions of domestic telephone records that cannot plausibly be relevant to an authorized investigation.''  The justices gave no reason for rejecting the group's petition, but the unusual procedure of bypassing the lower courts probably played a role. Other, more conventional challenges to government surveillance programs are pending. In urging the justices not to hear the case, the federal government said ''the proper way'' to challenge the surveillance ''is to file an action in Federal District Court to enjoin the program, as other parties have done.'' It cautioned, though, that ''the government may assert certain threshold defenses to such a suit.'' The case is In re Electronic Privacy Information Center, No. 13-58. In February, in Clapper v. Amnesty International, the Supreme Court ruled, 5 to 4, that human rights groups, lawyers and journalists could not show they had been spied on, and so lacked standing to challenge a surveillance program. After the recent revelations about widespread government surveillance, civil liberties groups have filed fresh challenges in federal trial courts, saying they can now show that they have standing. Last month, federal prosecutors opened another avenue for possible court review of a surveillance program by telling a criminal defendant in a terrorism case, Jamshid Muhtorov, that evidence against him came from a warrantless wiretap. That notification allows Mr. Muhtorov to seek to suppress the evidence by arguing that it was derived from unconstitutional surveillance. Given the government's acknowledgment, there would seem to be no issue on standing. "
Congress and the Courts Weigh New Attempts to Scale Back N.S.A. Spying,"WASHINGTON -- Congressional critics of the National Security Agency program that collects the telephone records of millions of Americans stepped up their efforts as the Supreme Court on Monday turned away an unusual challenge to the scope of the surveillance. The intensifying push against the N.S.A. on both the legal and legislative fronts reflected new pressure being put on the extensive surveillance effort in the wake of revelations by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden, pressure that is running into stiff resistance from congressional leaders of both parties as well as the Obama administration.  The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed the challenge directly with the Supreme Court, arguing that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had ''exceeded its statutory jurisdiction when it ordered production of millions of domestic telephone records that cannot plausibly be relevant to an authorized investigation.'' The justices gave no reason for rejecting the group's petition, but the unusual procedure of bypassing the lower courts probably played a role. Other, more conventional challenges to government surveillance programs are pending. In urging the justices not to hear the case, the federal government said ''the proper way'' to mount a challenge ''is to file an action in Federal District Court to enjoin the program, as other parties have done.'' It cautioned, though, that ''the government may assert certain threshold defenses to such a suit.'' The case is In re Electronic Privacy Information Center, No. 13-58. After the recent revelations about widespread government surveillance, civil liberties groups have filed fresh challenges in federal trial courts, saying they can now show that they have standing. Members of both parties are making a push for laws that would rein in N.S.A. data collection programs and bring more transparency to intelligence gathering. Those seeking to impose new requirements on the N.S.A. hope to take advantage of a small window of opportunity and attach their provisions onto an annual Pentagon policy measure now headed for Senate consideration. ''When you have a train that is sure to reach the station, you want to add your car to that train,'' said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. ''Even if it means a battle.'' By raising new questions about the operations of these surveillance programs -- whose disclosure by Mr. Snowden created one of the more disruptive episodes in Barack Obama's presidency -- Congress seems set to provoke yet another uncomfortable public discussion for a White House struggling to overcome severe problems with its health law. Leaders of both parties in Congress are hardly eager to see the issue come up again. In the Senate, Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, is wary of any measure that the White House thinks is harmful to national security. He and other Senate leaders are considering erecting procedural barriers to amendments to the Pentagon legislation. The leadership resistance limits chances for quick success in the Senate. In the House, Speaker John A. Boehner has said he believes dealing with N.S.A. questions in the short time left this year would rush a process that should be longer and more deliberative. But lawmakers like Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and one of the Senate's strongest critics of mass surveillance, and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, who has tried to bring greater attention to national security practices he argues are unchecked, see no reason to wait. ''What I'm going to zero in on,'' Mr. Wyden said in an interview, ''is much of what the intelligence leadership in the past has been misleading about, has shrouded in incomprehensible intelligence-speak or has just been flat-out wrong.'' He added that he thought the timing with the pending defense bill was ideal. ''I think there's an opportunity to work with senators of varying different views to set the record straight about the government's surveillance authority and jump-start the broader debate about intelligence reform,'' he said. The amendment Mr. Wyden has been circulating in recent days to colleagues would create a battery of new disclosure requirements for the intelligence agencies, including public reports on how often they have conducted mass digital sweeps that enable them to track cellphones, and on how many times they have violated their own privacy rules and safeguards. Mr. Wyden drafted his amendment to appeal to both ends of the spectrum on surveillance. It purposely contains nothing about banning N.S.A. data collection methods so it does not alienate those who are generally supportive of current intelligence practices. He declined to say how many senators had signed on, but did say a number of influential centrists who hold very different views on N.S.A. policies have expressed interest. ''Certainly the concept of more accountability and transparency has got a lot of senators' interest,'' he added. The larger and more divisive fight over banning certain N.S.A. programs, which Mr. Wyden and other members of Congress have been leading, would wait until next year. Questions about the N.S.A. are especially difficult for the Democratic Party, which has a core group of liberals who oppose giving the government the blanket authority to collect vast quantities of data on its citizens. The party also has members, like Mr. Reid and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who are inclined to be deferential to the president and intelligence officials. Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and the gatekeeper of the amendments that will eventually find their way onto the Pentagon bill, has said he prefers that N.S.A. issues be kept out of it. ''It's really a separate issue and should not be on the defense bill,'' he said. ''It's probably the only way we can get a defense bill done if we keep nondefense-related amendments off the bill.'' This year, more than half of the House Democrats defied Mr. Obama and their leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, and voted to block the N.S.A. from collecting huge troves of phone records. Not quite half of the House Republicans also voted for the measure, but it ultimately failed in a close vote. But there are signs this time could be different. Asked last week if she thought it was time for Congress to revisit questions of government surveillance, Ms. Pelosi strongly pushed back on the notion that she was in favor of broad government authority, and said lawmakers should take up the issue. ''I have been a critic of this program for a very long time,'' she said, adding that while she still did not support a ban on bulk data collection, she was open to other changes. ''I think the discussion should take place.'' "
A Night Watchman With Wheels?,"The night watchman of the future is five feet tall, weighs 300 pounds and looks a lot like R2D2 -- without the whimsy. And will work for $6.25 an hour. A company in California has developed a mobile robot, known as the K5 Autonomous Data Machine, as a safety and security tool for corporations, as well as for schools and neighborhoods. ''We founded Knightscope after what happened at Sandy Hook,'' said William Santana Li, a co-founder of that technology company, now based in Sunnyvale, Calif. ''You are never going to have an armed officer in every school.''  But what is for some a technology-laden route to safer communities and schools is to others an entry point to a post-Orwellian, post-privacy world. ''This is like R2D2's evil twin,'' said Marc Rotenberg, the director of the Electronic Privacy and Information Center, a privacy rights group based in Washington. And the addition of such a machine to the labor market could force David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, to rethink his theory about how technology wrecks the middle class. The minimum wage in the United States is $7.25, and $8 in California. Coming in substantially under those costs, Knightscope's robot watchman service raises questions about whether artificial intelligence and robotics technologies are beginning to assault both the top and the bottom of the work force as well. The K5 is the work of Mr. Li, a former Ford Motor Company executive, and Stacy Dean Stephens, a former police officer in Texas. They gained some attention in June for their failed attempt to manufacture a high-tech police cruiser at Carbon Motors Corporation in Indiana. Knightscope plans to trot out the K5 at a news event on Thursday -- a debut that is certain to touch off a new round of debate, not just about the impact of automation, but also about how a new generation of mobile robots affects privacy. The co-founders have chosen to position the K5 not as a job killer, but as a system that will upgrade the role of security guard, even if fewer humans are employed. ''We want to give the humans the ability to do the strategic work,'' Mr. Li said in a recent telephone interview, describing a highly skilled analyst who might control a herd of security robots. The robot, which can be seen in a promotional video, is still very much a work in progress. The system will have a video camera, thermal imaging sensors, a laser range finder, radar, air quality sensors and a microphone. It will also have a limited amount of autonomy, such as the ability to follow a preplanned route. It will not, at least for now, include advanced features like facial recognition, which is still being perfected. Knightscope settled in Silicon Valley because it was hoping for a warm reception from technology companies that employ large security forces to protect their sprawling campuses. There are about 1.3 million private security guards in the United States, and they are low-paid for the most part, averaging about $23,000 a year, according to the Service Employees International Union. Most are not unionized, so they are vulnerable to low-cost automation alternatives. The K5 also raises questions about mass surveillance, which has already set off intense debate in the United States and Europe with the expansion of closed-circuit television systems on city streets and elsewhere. The Knightscope founders, however, have a radically different notion, which involves crime prediction, or ''precog'' -- a theme of the movie ''Minority Report.'' ''We have a different perspective,'' Mr. Li said. ''We don't want to think about 'RoboCop' or 'Terminator,' we prefer to think of a mash-up of 'Batman,' 'Minority Report' and R2D2.'' Mr. Li envisions a world of K5 security bots patrolling schools and communities, in what would amount to a 21st-century version of a neighborhood watch. The all-seeing mobile robots will eventually be wirelessly connected to a centralized data server, where they will have access to ''big data,'' making it possible to recognize faces, license plates and other suspicious anomalies. Mr. Rotenberg said such abilities would rapidly encroach on traditional privacy rights. ''There is a big difference between having a device like this one on your private property and in a public space,'' he said. ''Once you enter public space and collect images and sound recordings, you have entered another realm. This is the kind of pervasive surveillance that has put people on edge.'' Mr. Li said he believed he could circumvent those objections by making the data produced by his robots available to anyone in a community with access to the Internet. ''As much as people worry about Big Brother, this is as much about putting the technology in the hands of the public to look back,'' he said. ''Society and industry can work together on this issue.'' This is essentially a reprise of the debate over Google's Street View system, which has drawn opposition from privacy advocates. But while Google's cars captured still images infrequently, a pervasive video and audio portal that autonomously patrolled a neighborhood would in effect be a real-time Street View system. For the moment, the system is unarmed, and it is certain to become the target of teenagers who will undoubtedly get a thrill from knocking the robot over. Mr. Li said he believed this was not an insurmountable challenge, given the weight, size and video-recording ability of the bots. Mr. Rotenberg said a greater challenge would be community opposition. He acknowledged, however, that the K5's looks were benign enough. ''It doesn't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger,'' he said. ''Unless he was rolled over and pressed into a ball.'' "
A Senator Plans Legislation to Rein In Authorities' Cellphone Data Requests,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Cellphone carriers last year answered at least 1.1 million requests from law enforcement agencies seeking information on caller locations, text messages and other data for use in investigations, according to reports from the carriers. Most of the requests were for information from a specific customer account. But law enforcement agencies also received information from 9,000 so-called tower dumps, in which the agencies were granted access to data from all the phones that connected to a cell site during a specified period of time. The cellphone carriers' reports, which came in response to a congressional inquiry, underscored the law enforcement agencies' strong reliance on wireless phone records. The carriers are shown to turn over records thousands of times a day in response to police emergencies, subpoenas and other requests.  Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, requested the reports from seven carriers, including AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and T-Mobile US. Mr. Markey conducted a similar audit last year as a member of the House, seeking information from carriers about law enforcement requests for 2011. In 2011, the carriers complied with 1.3 million requests from law enforcement agencies. That number is not directly comparable with 2012's total of 1.1 million requests because Sprint, the third-largest American carrier, did not answer all of Senator Markey's questions. Senator Markey said he planned to introduce legislation in the coming weeks that would provide stronger privacy protections for consumers, including the requirement of a warrant for police to get cellphone location information from a carrier as proof that it would help uncover evidence of a crime. ''Congress needs to ensure that our laws keep up with technology, including how law enforcement handles and disposes of this sensitive mobile phone information,'' Senator Markey said in a phone interview. The wide-ranging nature of government surveillance programs, many of which have been revealed by documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, has nudged some lawmakers to reassess the nation's privacy protections. Last week, it was reported that the N.S.A. tracks the location and movements of hundreds of millions of cellphones outside the United States, according to some of the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden. Technology companies like Apple and Google have recently started publishing so-called transparency reports on the government and law enforcement requests that they receive, but the carriers have not released similar reports. The carriers' responses to Senator Markey about law enforcement requests are the closest thing yet to a transparency report. The carriers sometimes resist requests from law enforcement, according to the reports. Reasons for rejection include when a request does not fully comply with the law -- for example, when a signed court order is required instead of a subpoena. Verizon said in many instances law enforcement sought information that the carrier did not have. But the carriers' responses to Senator Markey's inquiries also suggest that data-sharing policies are inconsistent among carriers. Some carriers, like AT&T and T-Mobile US, require a warrant for law enforcement to gain access to a person's current location data. But Verizon Wireless and Cricket say they cannot provide real-time location information at all. The carriers also retain the location data collected from cell sites for varying periods of time. While most of the companies retain records for six to 18 months, AT&T holds them for five years. Some types of content, like text messages or voice mail messages that are older than 180 days, are provided to law enforcement by AT&T with a subpoena, but not a warrant. The carriers were also shown to comply with tower dumps at 9,000 cell sites, a small percentage of the 302,000 cell sites that were operational last year. But Christopher Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, who reviewed the carriers' responses, said the number of tower dumps was significant. ''Cell towers are handling hundreds of thousands of calls at any given time, getting personal info on hundreds of thousands of people for extended periods of time in order for police to gather information on one person,'' Mr. Calabrese said. ''What I was really struck by in looking at this stuff is the very powerful informants our cellphones make,'' he said. ''They know so much about us and they can share so much about us -- our texts, where we're going online, our physical movements. It's a host of information that clearly law enforcement is very aware of and actively accessing.'' The carriers devote a significant amount of resources to dealing with requests from law enforcement. For example, AT&T said in its response that it had a staff of 100 full-time employees working seven days a week handling responses. It received $10.3 million in reimbursement for law enforcement responses last year. Senator Markey said the legislation he planned to propose would require the Federal Communications Commission to limit the amount of time carriers could hold on to customers' personal information. The senator said he also hoped to create a method to narrow down the information that police collected from a cell tower when doing so-called dumps. Another piece of the legislation would require law enforcement officials to submit a signed and sworn statement whenever they received information from carriers in the case of emergency circumstances, to increase accountability for the requests. Senator Markey said he also wanted law enforcement to write routine reports disclosing the nature and volume of their requests. Documents: User Data Requests Received by Cellphone Carriers "
Start-Up Lets Users Track Who Tracks Them,"Is your Web browsing history your business - or everyone else's? A start-up based in Palo Alto, Calif., Disconnect, which helps you track who is tracking you online, this week released its latest tool to help safeguard your browsing history. Its new browser extension works on Chrome and Firefox browsers and is meant to block an invisible network of around 2,000 separate tracking companies.  Most of the tracking is in the service of advertising: If you were browsing a camping goods site over the weekend, for instance, don't be surprised to see an ad pop up for hiking boots when you log in to a news site the next morning or even, when you open up your Facebook page. It is a tried-and-true digital advertising strategy called retargeting. Facebook is the latest entrant, and its advertising partners are experimenting with fine-grained ways to nudge you with ads on Facebook based on what you were looking at when you were not on Facebook. The Disconnect filter, which Brian Kennish, a former Google engineer, started building two years ago, is squarely aimed at controlling that kind of targeted advertising. ""We are stopping that flow of data as you bounce around the Web,"" said Mr. Kennish, a company co-founder. ""Third-party retargeters are not going to have information about you."" The new Disconnect filter is part of an emerging crop of privacy tools aimed at tech-savvy consumers who want to protect personal data online. Most of these companies - Abine and Ghostery are others - offer at least a basic version of their product free and charge for more advanced versions. Disconnect is offering its filter on a sliding scale. These tracker filters are distinct from the long-debated Do Not Track signals that exist on most Web browsers and that are intended to give users a way to control whether their browsing history can be used for targeted advertising. Digital advertisers have fought hard against industrywide standards. And at the moment, even if a consumer turns on the Do Not Track signal on her browser, advertisers are not obliged to honor it. The filters, like the one from Disconnect, stop third-party trackers altogether. It also shows you how many tracking companies are working in the background of the Web sites you visit. It still lets what are known as first-party trackers keep tabs on you. That means, Mr. Kennish said, that Amazon can still keep tabs on the kinds of books you buy to recommend others. But your book-browsing history is not monitored by other companies trying to target their ads. You will still see ads. They just won't be based on your behavior on the Web.  "
Tech Companies Tread Lightly in Statements on U.S. Spying,"Someone's not telling the whole truth. In the wake of the news leak that the National Security Agency is engaged in a wide-ranging surveillance program of Internet users through a system called Prism, the world's biggest technology companies responded by unilaterally denying any involvement in the government's spying apparatus. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, declared: ""Facebook is not and has never been part of any program to give the U.S. or any other government direct access to our servers,"" adding that, ""We hadn't even heard of Prism before yesterday."" Larry Page, Google's co-founder and chief executive, went slightly further. ""The U.S. government does not have direct access or a 'back door' to the information stored in our data centers,"" he said. Apple, Microsoft, AOL and Yahoo followed with denials as well.  And yet President Obama and the United States director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., have publicly confirmed the existence of the Prism system, without providing any details about it. Of course, the news - as well as the responses - raises doubts about who is telling the truth and about how extensive the spying program really may be. But perhaps just as important, the episode also raises questions about how publicly traded companies with hundreds of millions of consumers - companies that are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission - can, and should, react to news when pressed about involvement in confidential government programs. ""They are in a very difficult position,"" said Thomas A. Sporkin, a former S.E.C. enforcement official and now a partner at Buckley Sandler. ""On one hand they want to project an image of protecting your privacy. On the other, they have statutory obligations to keep government programs confidential"" or potentially risk criminal charges if they exposed a secret government program. Companies could also face a problem if their disclosures were misleading to investors, but only if they materially affected the stock price or had some other adverse effect, lawyers said. These companies did not just say ""no comment."" They flat-out denied involvement. Mr. Sporkin said, ""They are probably not being completely forthcoming, but they are probably not lying."" He noted that the statements were highly vetted by legal teams. While the companies might have wanted to stick in ""no comment"" mode, a version of peer pressure kicked in, said one chief executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the fragility of the situation. Once one company issued a flat denial, the others felt they had to follow suit, he said. Indeed, the statements that companies like Facebook and Google made are probably truthful if taken literally. I don't doubt Mr. Page when he said, ""Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users' data are false, period."" The title of his statement, which appeared on Google's corporate blog and was also signed by the company's chief legal officer, David Drummond, was ""What the...?"" But I also don't doubt another part of his statement that was frequently overlooked: ""We provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law."" In other words, when the government makes a legitimate request - and through Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which was highlighted by the leak, the government can seek vast troves of information - Google and others comply. It is possible, for example, that Mr. Page and Mr. Zuckerberg had never been told that the government's program was called Prism. And it is highly unlikely the government has a password granting access to company servers despite early reports quoting a government document that used the phrase ""direct access"" and now appears as if it overstated the case. At the same time, however, companies like Facebook and Google have clearly worked with the government to create systems to transfer vast amounts of private data that is sought by the N.S.A. and other government agencies. The New York Times reported last week, based on people briefed on the matter, that Google and Facebook discussed plans ""to build separate, secure portals, like a digital version of the secure physical rooms that have long existed for classified information, in some instances on company servers."" That is different from the idea that the government has ""direct access"" to corporate servers, but it still means that the companies are providing the government with enormous amounts of data. One explanation for the distinction between the corporate denials and the leaked presentation was explained this way in The Washington Post, which along with The Guardian posted several slides from a 41-page presentation about the Internet program: ""It is possible that the conflict between the Prism slides and the company spokesmen is the result of imprecision on the part of the N.S.A. author."" Senior executives I spoke with at many of the technology companies cited in the Prism documents said they routinely provided the government with requested data, in some cases months' worth of e-mail traffic for a certain address. They have teams of people whose entire job is to work with the government to comply with such requests, which come in daily if not more frequently. Once that information is transferred to the government, an agency can store that data and sort it, integrate it with other data to their heart's content. Mr. Sporkin, for example, said that when he was at the S.E.C., the agency would regularly make requests for stock trades and then store that information so it could use it later, sorting it and mixing it with other sources of data. Most technology companies have a ""terms of service"" agreement that requires users to accept such a provision before signing up. Buried in the fine print of Facebook's is this: ""We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so."" Theoretically, a clever lawyer could make the case that the companies' public denials have now become part of the terms of service and that customers are relying on them to be true. If those denials turn out to conflict with actions in the future, the companies - again theoretically - could face trouble with their customers and even possibly another arm of the government, like the F.T.C., setting up a true conundrum. So while the nation's biggest technology companies may not be a part of systematic large-scale spying program, it is clear that they are legally required to play a significant role in funneling data to the government. That leaves them on a tightrope balancing what they can say to their customers and investors while complying with their obligations to keep the government's secrets.  "
A Game That Deals in Personal Data,"[Video: A demo of the Data Dealer game. Watch on YouTube.]All kinds of companies and services - social networks, data brokers, loyalty card programs to name just a few - amass and analyze details about millions of consumers' activities and preferences. But the inner workings of this surveillance economy remain largely opaque to the public despite the recent revelations of widespread government data-mining of people's phone and e-mail records. Now a group of Web developers in Austria has introduced an online game called Data Dealer that aims to make the business of consumer profiling more transparent. The animated game encourages players to amass and sell fictional profiles containing details like the names, birth dates, weight, height, shopping and dietary habits of imaginary consumers.  The idea behind this cartoon data collection ecosystem is to give players a visceral sense of the widespread trade in personal data, says Wolfie Christl, a co-creator of the game. ""If you tell people they should be a bit careful, nobody listens. It's boring,"" said Mr. Christl, 36, who lives in Vienna. The game, he said, is intended to help people ""understand a few things - what kind of personal data exists, which attributes are collected, who is collecting this data, why and what they are using it for."" In Data Dealer, each player starts out with an avatar of a database, a gray anthropomorphic vault containing more than a million profiles and a budget of $5,000. Players can buy additional profiles from a variety of sources like a dating Web site, a sweepstakes company - or even a disgruntled nurse named Mildred who is selling access to her hospital's patient database. Players can also earn money by selling their profiles to a fictional large employer called ""Star Mart,"" a health insurance company or an imaginary government entity referred to as ""Central Security Agency."" Each vendor lists the consumer details it has to sell. The fictional dating site, for example, is selling the relationship status, sexual orientation and political attitudes of its members, along with their birth dates, genders, phone numbers and e-mail address. The cost to the player: $150 for 8,000 profiles. Although hypothetical members of the dating site may think they are anonymous, the game suggests that data dealers could use such disparate details to connect people's dating profiles to their real names. ""For the chance to find their soul mate, lonely souls will pour out their hearts to you and let you in on their deepest secrets,"" the game says. ""Once you line up e-mail addresses and pseudonyms with the real names, things start to get interesting."" Data dealer also explains to players the value of different types of information. Of e-mail addresses, for instance, the game says: ""once you know someone's e-mail address, you can pinpoint them anywhere, no matter which nickname or pseudonym they use. In addition, e-mail addresses can be sold quite profitably for marketing purposes."" Although the first version of Data Dealer is meant only for individual players, the game's developers are raising money on Kickstarter this week to finance an upgraded version that will let people play against one another - and hack each others' databases. Mr. Christl says he hoped the game inspired people to demand more control over the information collected and disseminated about them. ""I think at the moment all this data is being controlled by big companies and by government institutions and not by people themselves,"" Mr. Christl says. ""We need a self-determined usage of personal data in the future. Some changes are needed to achieve that."" Although Data Dealer is only a game, the timing of its Kickstarter campaign seems fortuitous. Offline, federal regulators have been urging real data dealers to make their practices more transparent. A few weeks ago, for instance, Julie Brill, a member of the Federal Trade Commission, proposed that data brokers - companies that gather and analyze information from multiple sources about millions of consumers - give the public more access to and control over details collected about them. ""Data brokers should develop online tools so consumers could see the information multiple companies have about them,"" says, Ms. Brill. The name of her initiative: ""Reclaim Your Name.""  "
Bankrolling The Botnets,"I'm an academic researcher, primarily studying underground economies; as such, my group's work involves transacting with known criminals, like botnet operators or certain types of spammers. While our research has been reviewed by legal counsel, I'm concerned by the fact that we are knowingly financing criminal organizations (often giving them hundreds or thousands of dollars at a time). Does the benefit of the scientific understanding we gain outweigh the harm that our funds might do? How sure should we be of a positive scientific outcome before entering into these transactions? We have no expectation of anything in return, and we often learn interesting information. NAME WITHHELD  Many of the questions I receive inevitably boil down to the same fundamental problem: Is it ethically acceptable to do one bad thing if that transgression benefits the world at large? Most of the time, I argue that it is (and then subsequently receive a dozen e-mails from outraged readers quoting Kant's Categorical Imperative). But this query is a little more complicated. Giving $1,000 to a spammer isn't like giving an AK-47 to a terrorist, but it does assist a socially abhorrent person who makes the world slightly worse (and could, in theory, proliferate a virus). Moreover, the data you're learning in exchange does not appear to irrefutably help anyone -- according to your letter, the principal upside is that you learn ''interesting information.'' So the question is really this: Is it morally acceptable to reward an annoying, semi-innocuous criminal in order to better understand how annoying, semi-innocuous criminals operate? In the broadest sense, the answer is yes. Any serious attempt at improving our collective understanding of reality justifies a reasonable cost, assuming that cost does not directly violate anyone's human rights. The situation you describe probably qualifies -- but only if you can answer yes to the following questions: 1. Is this the best way to study underground economies? I can't say for certain -- but I know it can't be the only way. 2. Does the intent of your investigation represent any level of practical utility? I generally support ''knowledge for the sake of knowledge,'' but if you're rewarding someone who's making the world slightly less livable, there needs to be a degree of counterbalance. If successful, what you're learning here should have a real-world application. 3. To the best of your intellectual ability, do you fully understand the damage this action could inflict? Regarding your second query (''How sure should we be of a positive scientific outcome before entering into these transactions?''): This is an exploration. If you predecide what your findings need to be in order to validate the experiment, it will push you toward potentially false conclusions. For a researcher, that's intellectually unethical. The possibility of total failure is an acceptable (and a necessary) risk.

Prosecutors Say Five Ran A Credit Card Fraud Ring,"One worked for a doctors' office on Staten Island, using her access to elderly patients' records to steal their financial information, prosecutors said. Another was her fiancé, a Bronx man suspected of using the stolen financial information to change the addresses of the victims' credit cards. The new cards that were issued fueled a spending spree that the authorities said totaled nearly $700,000 and included courtside basketball tickets and trips to the Dominican Republic and Walt Disney World.  On Wednesday, the authorities charged the couple with a host of crimes, including enterprise corruption. Three other people were charged with taking part in the theft ring. Prosecutors said Amanda Zieminski, 26, who worked for South Shore Physicians on Staten Island, was at the center of the scheme. In 2008, a few years after she started working there, patients began reporting that their bank accounts had been compromised. Last year, a detective investigating one of those claims traced a stolen bank account -- with nearly $25,000 in unauthorized activity in just four days -- to an address in the Bronx, prosecutors said. Ms. Zieminski's fiancé, Clyde Forteau, lived there, in a well-kept two-story building off the Grand Concourse. Investigators began listening to cellphone conversations between Mr. Forteau, 29, and Ms. Zieminski, and pieced together the scheme, which prosecutors said preyed on elderly patients and used their personal information to steal from their accounts. Prosecutors said Ms. Zieminski and Mr. Forteau bought front-row tickets to an N.B.A. playoff game, field-level seats to a Jets football game and tickets to Walt Disney World in Florida, where Mr. Forteau proposed to Ms. Zieminski at Cinderella's Castle. (''Make no mistake, Amanda Zieminski is no Cinderella and Clyde Forteau is far from Prince Charming,'' Daniel M. Donovan Jr., the Staten Island district attorney, said in a statement.) The couple left a trail of their spending in photographs on Facebook. One shows them in a happy embrace while standing in front of the castle lighted with pink lights. Another shows a Cinderella cake etched with the words ''Will you marry me?'' sitting next to a glass slipper. Mr. Forteau's brother, Jerome, 25, was also charged in the scheme. A Facebook page of the brothers' rap duo, called Yung Squad, shows the two sitting in expensive seats at sporting events, seats that prosecutors said were paid for with stolen money. At the Forteaus' home in the Bronx, their mother, Almurray, was shocked to learn from a reporter what her sons had been charged with. ''I didn't know anything,'' Ms. Forteau said. ''Amanda? Amanda?'' she asked. ''She looks so nice and innocent.'' She said Ms. Zieminski and her son had been dating for eight years and planned to get married in two years. The authorities also arrested Abdul Yusef and Carmen Rivera, both from the Bronx. Prosecutors said that they, along with Jerome Forteau, collected the new credit cards that were sent to addresses across the city and delivered them to Clyde Forteau and Ms. Zieminski. When the police arrested the suspects this week, detectives found more than 50 credit cards, the authorities said. All five defendants pleaded not guilty. Four of the defendants were held on bail, and Carmen Rivera was released on her own recognizance. Lawyers for the accused could not immediately be reached. "
Europe Moves to Protect Companies' Trade Secrets,"BRUSSELS -- The European Union plans to propose rules this month aimed at creating its first broad protection of trade secrets and setting penalties for those who try to profit from them illegally. The theft of trade secrets has long frustrated companies doing business in Europe. The lack of tough trade secret protections has resulted in any number of Asian-made knockoffs being sold in Europe, and the original producers often have little legal recourse. One instance occurred when a South Korean company copied Kevlar vests from DuPont. In Japan, a prototype tire by Michelin was stolen during a race and then reverse-engineered to create a competing product. Although Europe has long sought ways to solve the problem, the issue has gained urgency now that a trade pact is being negotiated with the United States. Another reason has been concern about state-sponsored spying on companies after the disclosures about the United States government's practices.  A draft of the proposed rules obtained by The New York Times replaces a porous country-by-country approach with a uniform set of guidelines under which the European Union's 28 member states could write their own regulations. Current rules vary widely, from those in Germany, which are relatively tough, to those in countries like Belgium and Bulgaria, where cracking down on copies is more difficult and enforcement more spotty. European officials said the Michel Barnier, the commissioner overseeing the process, had not yet signed off on the proposal, nor had the broader leadership of the European Commission, the executive branch of the European government. But the commission tentatively plans to adopt the new regulations on Nov. 27. They would then need to go through a long legislative negotiating process before a final version could come into force, proceedings that would probably take well over a year to conclude. The proposed regulations, formally known as a directive, seek to put teeth into enforcement. The draft states that when a court finds ''unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of a trade secret,'' the aggrieved party can seek remedies including recall or seizure of the copied goods, as well as their destruction, and the destruction of any documents containing the stolen secrets. Sanctions laid out in the directive could include ''recurring penalty payments in case of noncompliance.'' Damages ''in appropriate cases'' could include at a minimum the amount of royalties or fees that the violator would have had to pay if requesting proper authorization to use the trade secret. Trade secrets, like the formulas for Coca-Cola or Chanel No. 5, or a company's customer lists, are distinct from copyrighted or trademarked materials, which already have protections in Europe. Typically, it is either not possible to copyright a trade secret or not desirable, because doing so would require a company to disclose the secret. Although stealing trade secrets is a criminal offense, the European regulation is aimed at creating a legal framework for punishing companies that try to profit from any theft. Some countries, like Japan, have legal protections for trade secrets. In the United States, most states have adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, a model that provides several remedies when trade secrets are stolen. Industrial, chemical and engineering companies -- American and European alike -- have been pushing for similar protections in Europe. American companies like DuPont have also raised the issue in public filings to regulators in the hope of influencing the trans-Atlantic trade talks, which began in July and continue this week in Brussels. The issue is also important for biotechnology companies. Asked about the draft of the new rules, the commission issued a statement saying the regulations would ''ensure that in cases of unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of a trade secret, a sufficient and comparable level of redress across the E.U. is provided.'' In a recent speech in London, Mr. Barnier, the European Union commissioner for internal market and services, addressed the matter. ''There is growing uncertainty among businesses who are faced with theft by competitors, including cyberattacks,'' Mr. Barnier said. ''If we want to keep attracting foreign direct investment, and also help build our 'Innovation Union,' we need to help protect confidential business information.'' The European Union commissioned two recent studies on the topic. One of them, released this year by the Baker & McKenzie law firm, found that there were not even common definitions of a trade secret among member states. The proposed regulations try to correct that. The report also found that legal remedies were scattershot. In countries including Estonia, Bulgaria and Finland, there is no recourse for the destruction or seizure of copied goods, Baker & McKenzie said. Sarah Turner, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, helped write another European study on the topic. She said enforcement rules in countries like Belgium discouraged potential claimants because ''they are likely to have to publish their secret to the world in the course of the proceedings.'' ''Misappropriation is becoming more common, not least because information can be copied electronically very easily,'' she said. ''As the law stands, it is possible to exploit differences in the law itself and the approach to enforcement to avoid liability.'' "
Just 5 Banks Prohibit Use of Social Security Numbers,"Despite the risk of fraud associated with the theft of Social Security numbers, just five of the nation's largest 25 banks have stopped using the numbers to verify a customer's identity after the initial account setup, a new report from Javelin Strategy & Research finds.  Social Security numbers are required to open a bank account, but shouldn't be used after that as a requirement for initiating communications with the bank, Javelin says. Some banks, for instance, require customers to provide the numbers when calling on the phone to speak with a bank representative, or contacting the bank to reset a password. Use of the numbers can make customers vulnerable to ""account takeover,"" in which a thief uses stolen information, like a Social Security number along with an address, to gain access to a bank account. About a third of account takeovers involve checking and savings accounts, according to Javelin's most recent data. ""Everyone would be well served if we would step away from Social Security numbers,"" Al Pascual, a senior analyst for security risk and fraud at Javelin, said in a phone interview. ""It's a powerful tool for a fraudster."" In 2011, Javelin reported in its Banking Identity Safety Scorecardthat all the banks in its report used the numbers in some way for customer identification. This year, five banks reported that they now prohibit their use - an improvement, the report said, but still ""distressingly low."" The five that reported prohibiting the use of the numbers are Comerica, Regions Bank, TD Bank, U.S. Bank and Union Bank. The country's biggest banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank, still use Social Security numbers, according to the report. Prohibiting use of the customer's Social Security number to verify identity ""may go a long way"" toward protecting customers' accounts, the report said. Overall, however, the report gave top marks to Bank of America for prevention and detection of identity fraud, and gave Chase the top ranking for resolving problems once they occur. Does your bank ask for your Social Security number when you call to discuss your account?  "
The Cost to Consumers of a Data Breach,"A new analysis of a huge data breach last year in Utah estimates that more than 120,000 cases of fraud will occur as a result of information stolen. Javelin Strategy & Research's analysis also estimates that each incident will result in more than $3,300 in losses, on average, and each consumer who is ultimately victimized as a result of the breach will spend about 20 hours and $770 on lawyers and time lost from work to resolve the case. Ripple effects from the incident in the spring of 2012 will also prove costly to banks and businesses that may also suffer fraud as a result of the stolen information, said Al Pascual, a security, risk and fraud analyst at Javelin.  ""We all need to be aware that breaches are occurring,"" he said. ""Breaches lead to fraud, and fraud affects all of us."" Using the specifics of the Utah breach, Javelin applied what it has learned from its prior research about the impact of such breaches - namely, that having your personal information compromised makes you more likely to become a victim of fraud. Javelin estimates that roughly one in four recipients of a data-breach letter ultimately become fraud victims. (The estimate is based on information provided by consumers themselves, rather than law enforcement.) ""These breaches are driving fraud,"" Mr. Pascual said. Criminals, he said, are generally not digging through trash or stealing mail to obtain personal data. ""They're stealing it digitally,"" he said. In the Utah case, about 280,000 Social Security numbers belonging to participants in the state Medicaid and Child Health Insurance Program were stolen from a database maintained by the Utah Department of Health. In addition, less sensitive pieces of information on another 500,000 participants were stolen. Social Security numbers are particularly dangerous in the hands of criminals, because they can be used in combination with other information about you to create or access bank accounts and obtain credit. The Social Security numbers were used by the department to verify eligibility for the insurance programs. But a contractor did not safeguard the server where the data was stored. The information was not encrypted and was protected only by a weak password that was easily hacked, the Javelin report said. There may be little that individual consumers can do to prevent such a breach. But there are steps they can, and should, take to protect themselves, if they are notified that their Social Security number has been compromised in a data breach, Mr. Pascual said. First, you should contact your bank and explain what has happened because many banksstill use Social Security numbers to verify customer identity. You can ask for an alternative means of verification, like a specially assigned PIN, or a series of questions known as ""dynamic"" authentication. For instance, the bank may ask you about the size of recent transactions, or other details that only you would be likely to know, before allowing access to your account online or over the phone. If the bank isn't willing or able to provide an alternate method of verification, ""It may be worth looking at institutions that offer better protection,"" Mr. Pascual said. Even if you haven't had your information compromised, you should make use of your bank's automatic account alerts. Such systems send you an e-mail or text message if unauthorized changes are made to your account, like the addition of a new authorized user or a new bill payment account, or a change of address. They can also notify you of significant transactions, like large withdrawals or transfers. ""The consumer is going to know first whether a transaction is valid or not,"" he said. If you're the victim of a breach and are offered free credit monitoring, you should take advantage of the service, he said. In the Utah case, victims were offered two years of credit monitoring and identity theft insurance. Ultimately, banks should stop using Social Security numbers as identifiers, he said. Have you had your personal information stolen? Did fraud occur as a result?  "
A Medical Service Using the Cloud,"Practice Fusion is a company that offers doctors cloud-based electronic medical records software for managing relationships with patients and big parts of the health care industry. It also seems like a good place to explore feelings about privacy, and the business of Big Data. The company, privately held and based in San Francisco, says it has 150,000 health care providers using its free service and medical records on 60 million patients. On Tuesday Practice Fusion announced a new service, called Patient Fusion, which enables people using the system to schedule appointments with any participating doctor.  If enough people use Patient Fusion, it should increase traffic for Practice Fusion's main business, which is putting advertising on those online health records. The company has relationships with lab testing companies and pharmacies. If a patient's records indicate, say, high cholesterol, a banner on top of the records may ask the doctor if a test should be scheduled, or a drug supplied. Practice Fusion is paid by labs to connect them to doctors. Patient Fusion, the new service, is a way for people to book appointments at times that work for them. It combines permission-based access to those patient records, the software's calendar appointment service for doctors, and Practice Fusion's collection of patient reviews of their doctors, which it typically solicits after each visit. ""If you want to see a doctor at 3 p.m. and your doctor is booked, I can put you in touch with every other local specialist who is available at that time,"" said Ryan Howard, chief executive of Practice Fusion. The doctor would have to be part of the Practice Fusion network, he said. ""You'll be able to see patient reviews of the doctor, and if you book with one of them, that doctor will automatically get your health history from Practice Fusion."" The company's ad business may give some pause, though Mr. Howard said that Practice Fusion, which he began as a service in 2007, does not give advertisers patient names or other identifiable information. The intention, he said, is to add efficiency to a system in which drug companies and labs often connect with doctors in clumsier ways, and in which patients often think their doctor is good without much empirical evidence.    To date, 27,000 of the network's doctors have agreed to participate in Patient Fusion. Even at that level, Mr. Howard said, Practice Fusion can draw off 1.5 million reviews, and offer three million appointments just in the month of April. Patient reviews of doctors, he said, are an important and lasting part of our health care system. ""I can get more information on a restaurant I'm going to than I can about a doctor,"" he said. ""I think my doctor is good. I think so. But I don't really know it.""  Whether Yelp-like reviews of doctors are a full and fair picture is not a well-addressed question. On Patient Fusion's Web site, the doctors have a 98 percent ""recommended"" rating, which suggests we tend to overvalue the quality of the people ensuring our well-being.  Yelp also has doctor reviews, a nonscientific examination of which shows a tendency to rate doctors highly and, if the experience is not good, the doctor gets just one star, not the two stars of a so-so restaurant. But there is certain to be even more data. In the future, Mr. Howard said, he would like to add information about which doctors have the best patient outcomes. As the system grows, and the data it collects grows too, other products are likely to be introduced. ""Think about a Bloomberg terminal for health,"" Mr. Howard said. ""We could have real-time information on what drugs are being prescribed. That is information about market share, and whether you are losing it because patients are having adverse reactions, or doctors are prescribing generics. You can see how that would be interesting to a product manager at a pharmaceutical company. Also to a hedge fund manager.""  "
Internet's Sad Legacy: No More Secrets,"Email: bilton@nytimes.com Anyone who can watch you will watch you. In technology, that is one of the big lessons of 2013. The National Security Agency and who knows who else have been tracking this or hacking that. China has been breaking into our computers. Google has been sifting through our home networks. Facebook has been tinkering with its privacy settings. No wonder outfits like Snapchat have exploded onto the scene. They seem to go against the grain, holding out the promise that all those selfies, texts and emails will simply vanish.  Whisper, an ''it'' app for teens, supposedly lets people share secrets anonymously via smartphone. Telegram is being pitched as the adult version of Snapchat. But the fact is, many services that claim to offer that rarest of digital commodities -- privacy -- don't really deliver. Read the fine print. ''Just because information is unavailable to you and you don't see it doesn't mean that it is not being captured, stored, or even seen by someone else in transit,'' said Edward W. Felten, a professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton. Snapchat's privacy page explains that private images are stored on someone's phone -- and on its own servers. ''Forensically, even after they are deleted,'' Snapchat says, those images can be retrieved. Whisper's privacy page says the company owns the intellectual property, both images and text, that people post; Whisper reserves the right to sell that stuff to third parties. And Telegram, while seemingly less innocuous with its claims, nonetheless leaves out something you might want to know: someone can just take a screenshot or picture of that ''private'' conversation. ''Even if there are all sorts of technical barriers that the disappearing messaging services put up there, someone can just take a picture of the phone,'' said Kurt Opsahl, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties organization. ''If they can see it with their eyes, they can see it with a camera.'' In most instances, your Internet service provider or cellphone carrier gets to watch over your shoulder with every click. Even when these messaging apps aren't tracking your chats, the N.S.A. and other government agencies are. They're everywhere. Even people who play fantasy video games like World of Warcraft are being watched, according to documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden. Worse, the snooping doesn't just happen on our desktops and laptops. In our mobile-centric world, it happens everywhere. Through our mobile phone, our locations are being corralled and calculated. The N.S.A. can even figure out who we are with by triangulating phones' previous locations. Don't have a smartphone yet? They still know where you are and where you've been. The American Civil Liberties Union released a report this year that found that technologies that let governments scan license plates are being used to build databases of vehicle locations across the United States. The N.S.A. didn't respond to a request for comment, but the argument by some companies and government groups is that if you're not doing anything wrong and have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to worry about. Privacy experts strongly disagree. A new book by Harvey Silverglate, a lawyer in Massachusetts, titled ''Three Felonies a Day,'' claims the average professional in the United States commits at least three crimes every day. How? While academics, lawyers and even government officials don't actually know how many laws exist in today's judicial system, it's estimated that there are from 10,000 to 300,000 federal regulations that could be enforced criminally. Mr. Opsahl said we all probably break some of those laws online every day, too. ''There is a tremendous amount of information that is available about every person online, and the practical ability for government and private surveillance has never been greater,'' he said. So if you can't find privacy in a game with trolls and goblins, on a Sunday drive with your family or inside a messaging app with disappearing chats, what can you do? ''What's clear is that tracking technologies have outpaced democratic controls,'' said Ben Wizner , the director of the Speech, Privacy and Technology Project at the A.C.L.U. ''What we've learned this year is that agencies are determined to conduct surveillance on us, and there's not a whole lot we can do about it.'' But there is one thing that Mr. Wizner said can and should happen. Technologists are capable of building tools that can prevent such snooping -- things that go beyond disappearing messaging apps and that could protect everyone's privacy. ''This may be one of those once-in-a-generation moments when we recalibrate the powers of the citizens and the state,'' Mr. Wizner said. ''And that change can happen on the technological side, where the technologists that are disillusioned by the incessant tracking will use their skills to make surveillance more costly.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
sElance Pairs Hunt For Temp Work With Cloud Computing,"Cloud computing does not move computing power to small phones and big data centers. It is rearranging how we allocate work - maybe to a state of permanent, temporary work, for the mostly nontechnical ranks of the work force. On Tuesday Elance, an online service for hiring temporary workers, announced a service that enables companies to hire, manage and pay freelance workers in a virtual private environment. Trusted consultants, designers, programmers and other freelancers can be cataloged and called upon as needed, and paid through the same network. ""More and more of the U.S. work force is independent and going online,"" said Fabio Rosati, the chief executive of Elance. ""We want to make it so you can see who your best workers are through profiles and history, then check their availability, hire them with a couple of clicks, then pay them securely.""  Companies like Elance, ODesk, and Freelancer.com have long provided a means for people and companies to seek each other across the globe. For the most part, companies use their cloud-based service to post jobs publicly, indicating their needs and possibly getting more applicants than they wanted.  Judging from the Web sites, this kind of work, which gives workers more flexibility at the price of less stability, falls mostly to the more humanities-oriented tasks. Job categories on all three of the major sites include design, search engine optimization and marketing, and (gulp) article writing. Where there are programming jobs, they are usually less-technical tasks like Web site development and data entry. Under the new system, called the Private Talent Cloud, companies will pay Elance a fee to have a closed network of trusted freelancers, based on factors including previous jobs they've done and how other employees felt they performed. The financial Web site Motley Fool uses the service to manage a group of some 600 writers and core employees. Specialties the writers have, along with their availability, are posted. Other companies have used the service during its development phase, Mr. Rosati said, to hire graphic designers, and marketing talent. In most cases Elance manages the payment. Elance will also recommend other outsiders who might be good for new tasks, and, if a company wishes, it will post jobs in the larger community. New workers may be subject to background checks or have to sign guidelines of behavior in order to be admitted into a private talent cloud. This may all sound a little like a cloud-computing cross between Facebook and a hiring boss stopped his pickup truck in front of hungry day workers. More likely, it's another sign of change in a world where information is flying fast. Companies are competing in new areas faster than ever before, and no one seems to want a long-term relationship if they can avoid it. That means that corporate work is more likely to come in bursts, and teams for projects are likely to grow and shrink quickly, adding and losing different skills. Oracle and Workday have spent big on talent spotting and recruitment. Higher up, LinkedIn increases the range of people a company can look at for mostly full-time jobs, while Task Rabbit and Amazon's Mechanical Turk offer lower-paid, very short-term positions.  Elsewhere, companies like Quip and Box have introduced word processing products that stress fast collaboration. New kinds of office design, with blank surfaces that can be reconfigured to any need, are another symptom of the trend. Mr. Rosati said that what his Mountain View, Calif., company does is a benefit to the economy. The average hourly wage on Elance, he said, is $28, and in the second quarter of this year that amount grew by 5 percent from a year earlier, or 10 times faster than overall wage growth in the U.S. There is no way to check those figures, as Elance is privately held.  ""This is mostly for accretive, fractional work that probably wouldn't get done if you couldn't find people fast,"" he said. ""There are a lot of jobs now that only exist because a fractional work force - a retiree in Florida, or someone far from a city in North Dakota - can be reached online.""  Within two years, he predicted, half of U.S. companies would be employing these fractional workers. Elance itself consists of 300 people - 120 full time, and 180 freelance, running on its own private cloud.  "
