"As Phones Do More, They Become Targets of Mischief","Mobile phones are becoming ever more like personal computers. That means they are also becoming more vulnerable to traditional computer menaces like hackers and viruses.   This year, the Russian antivirus company Kaspersky Lab reported on a new malicious program that stole money by taking over Nokia phones and making small charges to the owners' wireless accounts.   Last month, an Australian student created an experimental worm that hopscotched across ''jailbroken'' iPhones, which are phones altered to run software Apple has not authorized. The mischievous worm did not cause any damage; it just installed a photo of the '80s pop star Rick Astley. But to security experts, it suggested that pernicious attacks on iPhones are possible.    Where there are perceived security threats, there are always entrepreneurs and investors looking to capitalize on them -- and build profitable businesses. This month Khosla Ventures, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm, led an investment group that injected $5.5 million into a fledgling security start-up called Lookout.    Lookout, based in San Francisco, was previously a consulting firm called Flexilis run by recent graduates of the University of Southern California. Now it wants to be the security giant of the mobile world, similar to the role Symantec plays in the PC market.   This year, Lookout began testing security software for phones running the Windows Mobile and Android operating systems, and it will soon introduce security applications for the BlackBerry and iPhone. The software protects phones against rogue programs and gives phone owners the ability to remotely back up and erase the data on their phones. It also lets them track the location of their handset on the Web.   A basic version of the software is free, while the company plans to charge a monthly subscription for a version with more features.   ''It feels a lot like it did in 1999 in desktop security,'' said John Hering, Lookout's 26-year-old chief executive, who for years has done research demonstrating security vulnerabilities in phones. ''People are using the mobile Web and downloading applications more than ever before, and there are threats that come with that.''   Lookout represents the latest attempt to build a new business that capitalizes on  the surge of smartphones. Thousands of companies making mobile games, shopping tools and other programs have sprung up in the last two years as the iPhone in particular has taken off. Lookout and its investors believe this is the right time to get into the market.   ''The rules of mobile are different,'' said Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, which also recently invested in Square, a mobile payments start-up. ''This is people's most personal computer, and it needs to be protected.''   Companies like Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, and Good Technology, a Silicon Valley-based mobile messaging firm, already offer mobile security tools, but their systems are aimed at businesses. Security firms like Symantec also have mobile security divisions, and a five-year-old company, Trust Digital, based in McLean, Va., has set its sights on this market.    Lookout says it can address the unique challenges of protecting cellphones, like preserving battery life. While the company will not give details, it says it has figured out how to get its software to work on the iPhone, which does not allow non-Apple programs to operate in the background, as security software typically does.   Mr. Hering and his co-founder, Kevin Mahaffey, 25, have been publicly demonstrating the weaknesses of mobile phones for some time. In 2005, they camped outside the Academy Awards ceremony in Hollywood and scanned the phones of stars walking the red carpet, using a short-range Bluetooth wireless connection. They found that as many as 100 of the phones were vulnerable to hacking over such a connection.   That year, at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, they hacked into a phone over a mile away using Bluetooth.    Lookout's founders and backers concede that for now, snoops and bad guys pose much less of a threat to cellphones than to PCs. But they believe there is an immediate need for software that preserves and protects a phone's data, from e-mail to corporate information, and they say current systems do not work when a family or business has multiple types of cellphones on various wireless networks.    For instance, a small business could install the Lookout software on many different types of devices, back up all the data and remotely erase a phone if, say, an employee leaves it in a cab.   Jeff Moss, a security expert and organizer of the Black Hat conference, said mobile security had historically ''been a solution in search of a problem.'' But he said mobile viruses had recently become more common in Asia. His own Nokia N97 phone even caught a bug recently, though software he was running from F-Secure, a Finnish security company, caught it in time.   ''The tipping point will be when we're using the phone to shop and conduct banking,'' Mr. Moss said. ''The more you do with the phone, the more valuable a target it becomes.'' "
"New Technology to Make Digital Data Disappear, on Purpose","A group of computer scientists at the University of Washington has developed a way to make electronic messages ''self destruct'' after a certain period of time, like messages in sand lost to the surf. The researchers said they think the new software, called Vanish, which requires encrypting messages, will be needed more and more as personal and business information is stored not on personal computers, but on centralized machines, or servers. In the term of the moment this is called cloud computing, and the cloud consists of the data -- including e-mail and Web-based documents and calendars -- stored on numerous servers.    The idea of developing technology to make digital data disappear after a specified period of time is not new. A number of services that perform this function exist on the World Wide Web, and some electronic devices like FLASH memory chips have added this capability for protecting stored data by automatically erasing it after a specified period of time.    But the researchers said they had struck upon a unique approach that relies on ''shattering'' an encryption key that is held by neither party in an e-mail exchange but is widely scattered across a peer-to-peer file sharing system.    Public key cryptography makes it possible for two parties who have never physically met to share a digital secret and as a result engage in a secure electronic conversation sheltered from potential eavesdroppers. The technology is at the heart of most modern electronic commerce systems.   Vanish uses a key-based encryption system in a different way, making it possible for a decrypted message to be automatically re-encrypted at a specified point in the future without fear that a third party will be able to gain access to the key needed to read the message.   The pieces of the key, small numbers, tend to ''erode'' over time as they gradually fall out of use. To make keys erode, or timeout, Vanish takes advantage of the structure of a peer-to-peer file system. Such networks are based on millions of personal computers whose Internet addresses change as they come and go from the network. This would make it exceedingly difficult for an eavesdropper or spy to reassemble the pieces of the key because the key is never held in a single location. The Vanish technology is applicable to more than just e-mail or other electronic messages. Tadayoshi Kohno, a University of Washington assistant professor who is one of  Vanish's designers, said Vanish makes it possible to control the ''lifetime'' of any type of data stored in the cloud, including information on Facebook, Google documents or blogs.    The potential value of such technology was brought into stark relief last week when a computer hacker stole data belonging to the social media company Twitter and e-mailed it to Web publishing companies in the United States and France.    The significance of the advance is that the Vanish ''trust model'' does not depend on the integrity of third parties, as other systems do. The researchers cite an incident in which a commercial provider of encrypted e-mail services revealed the contents of digital communication when served with a subpoena by a Canadian law enforcement agency.    The researchers acknowledged that there are unexplored legal issues surrounding the use of their technology. For example, certain laws require that corporations archive e-mails and make them accessible.   The researchers have developed a prototype of the Vanish system based on a plug-in module for the Mozilla Firefox Web browser. Using the system requires that both parties of the communication have a copy of the module, which is one of the limits of the technology. Mr. Kohno said that he did not envision Vanish being used for all communications, but only for sensitive ones. "
"Defend America, One Laptop at a Time","Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School who was an assistant attorney general from 2003 to 2004, is writing a book on cyberwar.   OUR economy, energy supply, means of transportation and military defenses are dependent on vast, interconnected computer and telecommunications networks. These networks are poorly defended and  vulnerable to theft, disruption or destruction by foreign states, criminal organizations, individual hackers and, potentially, terrorists. In the last few months it has been reported that Chinese network operations have found their way into American electricity grids, and computer spies have broken into the Pentagon's Joint Strike Fighter project.   Acknowledging such threats, President Obama recently declared that digital infrastructure is a ''strategic national asset,'' the protection of which is a national security priority.    One of many  hurdles to meeting this goal is that the private sector owns and controls most of the networks the government must protect. In addition to banks, energy suppliers and telecommunication companies, military and intelligence agencies use these private networks. This is a dangerous state of affairs, because the firms that build and run computer and communications networks focus on increasing  profits, not protecting national security. They invest in levels of safety that satisfy their own  purposes, and tend not to worry when they contribute to insecure networks that jeopardize national security.    This is a classic market failure that only government leadership can correct. The tricky task is for the government to fix the problem in ways that do not stifle innovation or unduly hamper civil liberties.   Our digital security problems start with ordinary computer users who do not take security seriously. Their computers can be infiltrated and used as vehicles for attacks on military or corporate systems. They are also often the first place that adversaries go to steal credentials or identify targets as a prelude to larger attacks.    President Obama has recognized the need to educate the public about computer security. The government should jump-start this education by mandating minimum computer security standards and by requiring Internet service providers to deny or delay Internet access to computers that fall below these standards, or that are sending spam or suspicious multiple computer probes into the network.   The government should also use legal liability or tax breaks to motivate  manufacturers -- especially makers of operating systems -- to improve vulnerability-filled software that infects the entire network. It should mandate disclosure of data theft and other digital attacks  --  to trusted private parties, if not to the public or the government --  so that firms can share information about common weapons and best defenses, and so the public can better assess which firms' computer systems are secure. Increased information production and sharing will also help create insurance markets that can elevate best security practices.     But the private sector  cannot protect these networks by itself any more than it can protect the land, air or water channels through which foreign adversaries or criminal organizations might attack us. The government must be prepared to monitor and, if necessary, intervene to secure  channels of cyberattack as well.    The Obama administration recently announced that it would set up a Pentagon cybercommand to defend military networks. Some in the administration want to use Cybercom to help the Department of Homeland Security protect the domestic components of private networks that are under attack or being used for attacks. Along similar lines, a Senate bill introduced in April would give the executive branch broad emergency authority to limit or halt private  Internet traffic related to ''critical infrastructure information systems.''    President Obama has tried to soothe civil liberties groups' understandable worries  about these proposals. In the speech that outlined the national security implications of our weak digital defenses, the president said the government would not monitor private sector networks or Internet traffic, and pledged to ''preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties we cherish as Americans.''    But the president is less than candid about the tradeoffs the nation faces. The government must be given wider latitude than in the past to monitor private networks and respond to the most serious computer threats.    These new powers should be strictly defined and regularly vetted to ensure legal compliance and effectiveness. Last year's amendments to the nation's secret wiretapping regime are a useful model. They expanded the president's secret wiretapping powers, but also required  quasi-independent inspectors general in the Department of Justice and the intelligence community to review effectiveness and legal compliance and report to Congress regularly.    Many will balk at this proposal because of the excesses and mistakes associated with the secret wiretapping regime in the Bush administration. These legitimate concerns can be addressed with improved systems of review.    But they should not prevent us from empowering the government to meet the cyber threats that jeopardize our national defense and economic security. If they do, then privacy could suffer much more when the government reacts to a catastrophic computer attack that it failed to prevent. "
Q&A,"Windows Security    On a Mac   Q.I recently purchased a Mac Mini and used the Boot Camp utility to partition the drive and install Windows XP. Is it necessary to install virus protection on the Windows partition?   A.Apple's Boot Camp software (snipurl.com/f360d) simplifies the process of partitioning off part of the Mac's hard drive so you can install a copy of the Windows operating system. When you start up the Mac from the Windows partition, though, it is essentially a Windows computer -- with pretty much all the Windows vulnerabilities to viruses, spyware and other malicious code floating around the Internet.   If you plan to use the Windows side of the machine online, adding an extra layer of security helps make it less vulnerable to lurking malware. And there's no shortage of security suites for Windows; you can find reviews of this year's products at sites likepcantivirusreviews.comand anti-virus-software-review.toptenreviews.com.    Comparatively tiny amounts of malware aimed at the Mac itself have been reported. But if it worries you anyway, a few security software companies like Intego and Symantec have ''combo'' bundles aimed at Boot Campers with both Mac and Windows antivirus programs.   Free utilities for both Windows and Mac OS X are also available. Avast (avast.com) and AVG (free.avg.com) are two options for the PC, as is ClamXav for the Mac (www.clamxav.com). Spybot Search & Destroy (www.safer-networking.org) and Lavasoft Ad-Aware Free (www.lavasoft.com) are two free Windows antispyware programs. Windows XP has its own firewall in the Control Panel area, but Check Point's free version of the Zone Alarm firewall is another option (www.zonealarm.com).   Mac OS X also comes with a built-in firewall -- click on the System Preferences icon on the Dock and open the Security icon to get to the Firewall tab.   Power Naps   For Your PC   Q.What is the difference between Stand By and Hibernate in Windows?   A. Both Stand By and Hibernate are power-saving modes that put the computer to ''sleep'' without fully shutting it down. But they differ in the way they store the work in progress on the computer when it's in its state of suspended animation.   Although it turns off the monitor and hard drive to conserve energy, Stand By keeps programs and files open on the desktop and in the PC's memory. The computer wakes up more quickly from Stand By mode, but a power interruption could cause it to lose any unsaved changes to open files.   Hibernate, on the other hand, needs a chunk of hard drive space to work because it saves an image of all the open programs and files to the disk before turning the computer mostly off. Because of this hard-drive activity, it takes longer to get into and out of Hibernate mode than Stand By, but your work is much safer and the computer saves more power.   TIP OF THE WEEK: You don't need an AmazonKindle 2 to have a mechanical box read documents out loud. Although its main function is to display PDF files, the free Adobe Reader software (www.adobe.com/products/reader) has a Read Aloud feature that can audibly recite the contents of many PDF files. To hear it for yourself, open a PDF file, go to the View menu and activate the feature from the Read Out Loud submenu. While copy-protected e-books may not be compatible with Read Out Loud, it is fine for works in the public domain, like books in PDF files from Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.us), academic papers and other PDF files.

New Military Command for Cyberspace,"Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates on Tuesday ordered the creation of the military's first headquarters designed to coordinate Pentagon efforts in the emerging battlefield of cyberspace and computer-network security, officials said.    Pentagon officials said Mr. Gates intends to nominate Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander, currently director of the National Security Agency, for a fourth star and to take on the top job at the new organization, to be called Cybercom.   The new command's mission will be to coordinate the day-to-day operation -- and protection -- of military and Pentagon computer networks. Currently, the Defense Department operates 15,000 separate computer networks and more than seven million individual computers or information-technology devices, officials said.   The Obama administration has undertaken significant efforts to protect the nation from cyberattack and prepare for potential offensive operations against adversary computer networks. The first step was creating a position of White House director for cybersecurity issues.   But the plans raised concerns that respect for privacy, diplomatic rules and sovereignty may be harmed as the administration accelerates its efforts to detect and attack adversaries on global computer networks that disregard borders.   ''I can't reiterate enough that this is not about the militarization of cyber,'' said Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, in discussing Mr. Gates's order on Tuesday.   ''This is an internal Department of Defense reorganization,'' Mr. Whitman said. ''It is focused only on military networks to better consolidate and streamline Department of Defense capabilities into a single command.''   The officer in charge of Cybercom would report up military channels through the Strategic Command, based in Omaha, Neb., which previously was in charge of network warfare and is the headquarters for military efforts in areas like space and nuclear deterrence.   Operating within Strategic Command, the new headquarters would be referred to as a ''sub-unified command,'' not unlike how subordinate four-star commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan report to another four-star commander at Central Command, in charge of all military operations in the Middle East.

"IN REVERSAL, U.S. TALKS TO RUSSIA ON WEB SECURITY","The United States has begun talks with Russia and a United Nations arms control committee about strengthening Internet security and limiting military use of cyberspace.    American and Russian officials have different interpretations of the talks so far, but the mere fact that the United States is participating represents a significant policy shift after years of rejecting Russia's overtures. Officials familiar with the talks said the Obama administration realized that more nations were developing cyberweapons and that a new approach was needed to blunt an international arms race.   In the last two years, Internet-based attacks on government and corporate computer systems have multiplied to thousands a day. Hackers, usually never identified, have compromised Pentagon computers, stolen industrial secrets and temporarily jammed government and corporate Web sites. President Obama ordered a review of the nation's Internet security in February and is preparing to name an official to coordinate national policy.    Last month, a delegation led by Gen. Vladislav P. Sherstyuk, a deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council and the former leader of the Russian equivalent of the National Security Agency, met in  Washington with representatives from the National Security Council and the Departments of State, Defense and  Homeland Security. Officials familiar with these talks said the two sides made progress in bridging divisions that had long separated the countries.   Indeed, two weeks later in Geneva, the United States agreed to discuss cyberwarfare and cybersecurity with representatives of the United Nations committee on disarmament and international security. The United States had previously insisted on addressing those matters in the committee on economic issues.    The Russians have held that the increasing challenges posed by military activities to civilian computer networks can be best dealt with by an international treaty, similar to treaties that have limited the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The United States had resisted, arguing that it was impossible to draw a line between the commercial and military uses of software and hardware.   Now there is a thaw, said people familiar with the discussions.   ''In the last months there are more signs of building better cooperation between the U.S. and Russia,'' said Veni Markovski, a Washington-based adviser to Bulgaria's Internet security chief and representative to Russia for the organization that assigns Internet domain names. ''These are signs that show the dangers of cybercrime are too big to be neglected.''   Viktor V. Sokolov, deputy director of the Institute of Information Security in Moscow, a policy research group run by General Sherstyuk, said the Russian view was that the American position on Internet security had shifted perceptibly in recent months.   ''There is movement,'' he said. Before, bilateral negotiations were limited to the relevant Russian police agency, the Bureau of Special Technical Operations, the Internet division of the Ministry of Interior, and the F.B.I.   Mr. Sokolov characterized this new round of discussions as the opening of negotiations between Russia and the United States on a possible disarmament treaty for cyberspace, something Russia has long sought but the United States has resisted.   ''The talks took place in a good atmosphere,'' he said. ''And they agreed to continue this process. There are positive movements.''   A State Department official, who was not authorized to speak about the talks and requested anonymity, disputed the Russian characterization of the American position. While the Russians have continued to focus on treaties that may restrict weapons development, the United States is hoping to use the talks to increase international cooperation in opposing Internet crime. Strengthening defenses against Internet criminals would also strengthen defenses against any military-directed cyberattacks, the United States maintains. An administration official said the United States was seeking common ground with the Russians.    The United Nations discussions are scheduled to resume in New York in January, and the two countries also plan to talk at an annual Russia-sponsored Internet security conference in Garmisch, Germany.    The American interest in reopening discussions shows that the Obama administration, even in absence of a designated Internet security chief, is breaking with the Bush administration, which declined to talk with Russia about issues related to military attacks using the Internet.    Many countries, including the United States, are developing weapons for use on computer networks that are ever more integral to the operations of everything from banks to electrical power systems to government offices. They include ''logic bombs'' that can be hidden in computers to halt them at crucial times or damage circuitry; ''botnets'' that can disable or spy on Web sites and networks; or microwave radiation devices that can burn out computer circuits miles away.   The Russians have focused on three related issues, according to American officials involved in the talks that are part of a broader thaw in American-Russian relations known as the ''reset'' that also include negotiations on a new nuclear disarmament treaty. In addition to continuing efforts to ban offensive cyberweapons, they have insisted on what they describe as an issue of sovereignty calling for a ban on ''cyberterrorism.'' American officials view the issue differently and describe this as a Russian effort to restrict ''politically destabilizing speech.'' The Russians have also rejected a portion of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime that they assert violates their Constitution by permitting foreign law enforcement agencies to conduct Internet searches inside Russian borders.   In late October at a luncheon during a meeting on Security and Counter Terrorism at Moscow State University, General Sherstyuk told a group of American executives that the Russians would never sign the European Cybercrime Treaty as long as it contained the language permitting cross-border searches. "
The Government and the Web,"The Obama administration is considering new rules to make it easier for government Web sites to use ''cookies'' and other technology to track visitors. There are valid reasons for using such tools, but the government has to build in robust privacy protections.     The Clinton administration adopted a rule severely limiting tracking on federal Web sites. Tracking could be done only if officials could prove a compelling need and the agency head had personally authorized it.   Tracking technology can help improve the quality of Web sites by monitoring how many people are visiting and how they use the site, and by personalizing the experience. For example, the Parks Service could offer information based on where a user lives.   Browser makers have made it easier for users to remove cookies or even reject them wholesale. But tracking technology can still present a real privacy risk, especially for the uninitiated. If users give personal information on one government Web site, the government could track visits to its other Web sites, like one offering information on drug addiction or H.I.V./AIDS. It could do this with cookies, or by keeping track of users' IP addresses, which may be tied to specific individuals.    In recent years, the government has monitored some Americans' library use and illegally eavesdropped on telephone calls and e-mail. Privacy groups are concerned that the new rules could pave the way for third parties to collect large amounts of data through government sites -- for example, if an agency site posted a YouTube video carrying its own cookies.    The Office of Management and Budget is developing the new rules. Officials say they recognize that people must be told that their use of Web sites is being tracked -- and be given a chance to opt out. More is needed. The government should commit to displaying such notices prominently on all Web pages -- and to making it easy for users to choose not to be tracked.   It must promise that tracking data will be used only for the purpose it was collected for: if someone orders a pamphlet on living with cancer, it should not end up in a general database. Information should be purged regularly and as quickly as possible. These rules must apply to third parties that operate on government sites.   The Obama administration is working to better harness the power of the Internet to deliver government services. That is good. But it needs to be mindful that people should be able to get help and be assured that their privacy is being vigilantly protected. "
Safe and Secure Keeping Windows 7 Safe and Secure,"Internet Security For Windows 7   Q.Does Windows 7 come with a firewall and other security software installed?   A. Like earlier versions of the Windows operating system, Windows 7 includes its own firewall program to help protect against Internet intruders. Microsoft also offers free virus and spyware protection with its Microsoft Security Essentials software. Links to the program, as well as to the company's Malicious Software Removal Tool, are at microsoft.com/security.    Microsoft's free security programs offer basic protection, but software suites from third-party companies add things like spam filtering, tools to defend against phishing, wireless-network monitoring and other features, as well as a more customizable firewall. These suites provide a more comprehensive set of protection programs, but they usually cost $40 to $70 dollars. (Some new Windows 7 computers may even come with a trial version or a one-year subscription to a security suite.)     Microsoft has a list of companies selling security software that works with Windows 7 at bit.ly/ecMt. The CNet site has reviews of many security programs at reviews.cnet.com/software and PC Magazine's roundup of this year's suites at bit.ly/14gXJi.    Sound Solutions   For Camcorders   Q.Do I need to buy an external microphone to use with my camcorder?   A. If you plan to use the camcorder in all types of recording situations and want to capture high-quality audio along with your video, investing in an external microphone is a good idea.    A built-in microphone is probably just fine for sporting events or other occasions where hearing distinct voices isn't necessary. But an external microphone can make a big difference in situations where audio clarity is important -- recording an interview, for example -- or where the goal is to eliminate as much background noise as possible.    Most camcorders include a microphone jack, so check to see what type your model has; many lower-priced camcorders have a stereo jack, while those on the higher end may use an XLR connector. Microphones are now available in wired or wireless varieties.    There are many different types of external microphones. The smaller ones include the hand-held TV news reporter variety, or the discreet lavalier microphone that clips onto a shirt collar or jacket lapel.    A shotgun microphone is generally larger and picks up sound in the direction it is pointed. Shotgun mics can be attached to the top of the camcorder or clamped to a pole and held out of the video frame while recording.    Prices for external microphones vary from about $12 for an inexpensive lapel clip-on to more than $1,000 for a professional handheld model. Web sites that specialize in audio gear and camcorder accessories usually have reviews and information on many current microphones, so you can research before you buy.

Obama Lays Out His Strategy on Cyberattacks,"President Obama declared Friday  that the country's disparate efforts to ''deter, prevent, detect and defend'' against cyberattacks would now be run out of the White House, but he also promised that he would bar the federal government from regular monitoring of ''private-sector networks'' and the Internet traffic that has become the backbone of American communications.   Mr. Obama's speech, which was accompanied by the release of a long-awaited new government strategy, was an effort to balance the United States' response to a rising security threat with concerns -- echoing back to the debates on wiretapping without warrants in the Bush years -- that the government would be regularly dipping into Internet traffic that knew no national boundaries.    One element of the strategy clearly differed from that established by the Bush administration in January 2008. Mr. Obama's approach is described in a 38-page public document being distributed to the public and to companies that are most vulnerable to cyberattack; Mr. Bush's strategy was entirely classified.   But Mr. Obama's policy review was not specific about how he would turn many of the goals into practical realities, and he said nothing about resolving the running turf wars among the Pentagon, the National Security Agency, the Homeland Security Department and other agencies over the conduct of defensive and offensive cyberoperations.    The White House approach appears to place a new ''cybersecurity coordinator'' over all of those agencies. Mr. Obama did not name the coordinator Friday, but the policy review said that whoever the president selects would be ''action officer'' inside the White House during cyberattacks, whether they were launched on the United States by hackers or governments.    In an effort to silence critics who have complained that the official will not have sufficient status to cut through the maze of competing federal agencies, Mr. Obama said the new coordinator would have ''regular access to me,'' much like the coordinator for nuclear and conventional threats.   Many computer security executives had been hoping that Mr. Obama's announcement would represent a turning point in the nation's unsuccessful effort to turn back a growing cybercrime epidemic. On Friday, several said that while the president's attention sounded promising, much would depend on whom he chose to fill the role.   James A. Lewis, a director at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a Washington group that published a bipartisan report last year calling on the president to appoint a cyberczar, said that the White House had now narrowed the list of candidates for the position to fewer than 10, but that choosing the right person would be difficult.   ''There aren't a lot of people who have the policy and the strategy skills and the technological knowledge to carry this out,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''If you're talking about missiles and space, there are a lot of people who know policy and technology, but in cyber its such a new field we're talking about a really small gene pool.''   For the first time, Mr. Obama also spoke of his own brush with cyberattacks, in the presidential campaign. ''Between August and October, hackers gained access to e-mails and a range of campaign files, from policy position papers to travel plans,'' he said, describing events that were known, though sketchily, at the time.   ''It was,'' he said, ''a powerful reminder: in this information age, one of your greatest strengths -- in our case, our ability to communicate to a wide range of supporters through the Internet -- could also be one of your greatest vulnerabilities.''   Mr. Obama's speech delved into technology rarely discussed in the East Room of the White House. He referred to ''spyware and malware and spoofing and phishing and botnets,'' all different approaches to what he called ''weapons of mass disruption.''    Although the president did not discuss details of the expanding role for the military in offensive and pre-emptive cyberoperations, senior officials said Friday that the Pentagon planned to create a new cybercommand to organize and train for digital war, and to oversee offensive and defensive operations.   A lingering disagreement has been how to coordinate that new command with the work of the National Security Agency, home to most of the government's expertise on computer and network warfare. One plan now under discussion would put the same general in charge of both the new cybercommand and the N.S.A. Currently, the security agency's director is Lt. Gen. Keith B. Alexander, who would be expected to be the leading contender for the new, dual position.   Industry executives were generally supportive of the initiative Mr. Obama announced, but also cautious.    ''There was nothing I was disappointed in,'' said Mark Gerencser, a cybersecurity executive at Booz Allen Hamilton, a consulting firm that deals extensively in the government's cybersecurity strategy.    Mr. Hamilton noted that the United States had separated defense and offense in the cybersecurity arena, while its opponents, including Russia and China, had a more fluid strategy.   ''It's like we're playing football and our adversaries are playing soccer,'' he said. "
Privacy May Be a Victim in Cyberdefense Plan,"A plan to create a new Pentagon cybercommand is raising significant privacy and diplomatic concerns, as the Obama administration moves ahead on efforts to protect the nation from cyberattack and to prepare for possible offensive operations against adversaries' computer networks.    President Obama has said that the new cyberdefense strategy he unveiled last month will provide protections for personal privacy and civil liberties. But senior Pentagon and military officials say that Mr. Obama's assurances may be challenging to guarantee in practice, particularly in trying to monitor the thousands of daily attacks on security systems in the United States that have set off a race to develop better cyberweapons. Much of the new military command's work is expected to be carried out by the National Security Agency, whose role in intercepting the domestic end of international calls and e-mail messages after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, under secret orders issued by the Bush administration, has already generated intense controversy.    There is simply no way, the officials say, to effectively conduct computer operations without entering networks inside the United States, where the military is prohibited from operating, or traveling electronic paths through countries that are not themselves American targets.    The cybersecurity effort, Mr. Obama said at the White House last month, ''will not -- I repeat, will not -- include monitoring private sector networks or Internet traffic.''   But foreign adversaries often mount their attacks through computer network hubs inside the United States, and military officials and outside experts say that threat confronts the Pentagon and the administration with difficult questions.    Military officials say there may be a need to intercept and examine some e-mail messages sent from other countries to guard against computer viruses or potential terrorist action. Advocates say the process could ultimately be accepted as the digital equivalent of customs inspections, in which passengers arriving from overseas consent to have their luggage opened for security, tax and health reasons.    ''The government is in a quandary,'' said Maren Leed, a defense expert at the bipartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies who was a Pentagon special assistant on cyberoperations from 2005 to 2008.    Ms. Leed said a broad debate was needed ''about what constitutes an intrusion that violates privacy and, at the other extreme, what is an intrusion that may be acceptable in the face of an act of war.''   In a recent speech, Gen. James E. Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a chief architect of the new cyberstrategy, acknowledged that a major unresolved issue was how the military -- which would include the National Security Agency, where much of the cyberwar expertise resides -- could legally set up an early warning system.   Unlike a missile attack, which would show up on the Pentagon's screens long before reaching American territory, a cyberattack may be visible only after it has been launched in the United States.    ''How do you understand sovereignty in the cyberdomain?'' General Cartwright asked. ''It doesn't tend to pay a lot of attention to geographic boundaries.''   For example, the daily attacks on the Pentagon's own computer systems, or probes sent from Russia, China and Eastern Europe seeking chinks in the computer systems of corporations and financial institutions, are rarely seen before their effect is felt inside the United States.   Some administration officials have begun to discuss whether laws or regulations must be changed to allow law enforcement, the military or intelligence agencies greater access to networks or Internet providers when significant evidence of a national security threat was found.   Ms. Leed said that while the Defense Department and related intelligence agencies were the only organizations that had the ability to protect against such cyberattacks, ''they are not the best suited, from a civil liberties perspective, to take on that responsibility.''   Under plans being completed at the Pentagon, the new cybercommand will be run by a four-star general, much the way Gen. David H. Petraeus runs the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from Central Command in Tampa, Fla. But the expectation is that whoever is in charge of the new command will also direct the National Security Agency, an effort to solve the turf war between the spy agency and the military over who is in charge of conducting offensive operations.    While the N.S.A.'s job is chiefly one of detection and monitoring, the agency also possesses what Michael D. McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, called ''the critical skill set'' to respond quickly to cyberattacks. Yet the Defense Department views cyberspace as its domain as well, a new battleground after land, sea, air and space.    The complications are not limited to privacy concerns. The Pentagon is increasingly worried about the diplomatic ramifications of being forced to use the computer networks of many other nations while carrying out digital missions -- the computer equivalent of the Vietnam War's spilling over the Cambodian border in the 1960s. To battle Russian hackers, for example, it might be necessary to act through the virtual cyberterritory of Britain or Germany or any country where the attack was routed.   General Cartwright said military planners were trying to write rules of engagement for scenarios in which a cyberattack was launched from a neutral country that might have no idea what was going on. But, with time of the essence, it may not be possible, the scenarios show, to ask other nations to act against an attack that is flowing through their computers in milliseconds.    ''If I pass through your country, do I have to talk to the ambassador?'' General Cartwright said. ''It is very difficult. Those are the questions that are now really starting to emerge vis-a-vis cyber.''   Frida Berrigan, a longtime peace activist who is a senior program associate at the New America Foundation's arms and security initiative, expressed concerns about whether the Obama administration would be able to balance its promise to respect privacy in cyberspace even as it appeared to be militarizing cybersecurity.   ''Obama was very deliberate in saying that the U.S. military and the U.S. government would not be looking at our e-mail and not tracking what we do online,'' Ms. Berrigan said. ''This is not to say there is not a cyberthreat out there or that cyberterrorism is not a significant concern. We should be vigilant and creative. But once again we see the Pentagon being put at the heart of it and at front lines of offering a solution.''   Ms. Berrigan said that just as the counterinsurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had proved that ''there is no front line anymore, and no demilitarized zone anymore, then if the Pentagon and the military services see cyberspace as a battlefield domain, then the lines protecting privacy and our civil liberties get blurred very, very quickly.'' "
Keeping Personal Data Private,"In 2006, a Veterans Affairs Department analyst lost a laptop and external drive with Social Security numbers and other personal data from more than 26 million veterans and active duty troops. There was a national call for a federal law to protect this sort of data -- as there has been after other big data breaches -- but nothing was done. Finally, a bill is moving in the Senate that would put more protections in place for personal data.    Computers hold an enormous amount of personal information about people. In the wrong hands, the data can be used to steal identities or drain bank accounts. There is a patchwork of laws that offers varying levels of protection to residents of most, but not all, states, but there is no overarching federal law.   Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat of Vermont, is sponsoring a bill, the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2009, that would beef up cybersecurity and make people's personal information safer. It would require entities that keep personal data to establish effective programs for ensuring that that data is kept confidential. That could include encryption of data, although the law does not specify any security method. When there is a breach, it would require that notice be given to individuals whose personal information is exposed.   The Leahy bill applies both to the private companies and to government, which is important, since both the private and public sectors have been responsible for major data breaches in the past few years. It would require data brokers -- companies that collect personal data and sell it to third parties -- to inform consumers about the data they have on them and allow people to correct erroneous information. The bill also makes it a crime to intentionally conceal a security breach that exposes personal data, and it increases criminal penalties for identity theft by use of electronic personal data.   One potentially troubling aspect of the bill is that it would pre-empt, or nullify, state laws in this area. That is not a problem if the bill remains in its current form. But it should not be allowed to get weaker during the legislative process. A weak federal law that pre-empts state protections would be worse than no federal law at all.   Mr. Leahy's bill was sent to the full Senate by the Judiciary Committee this month along with another worthy, but more limited, bill introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat of California.    There are many important issues competing for Congress's attention, but keeping people's personal information safe should rank high on the list. Senate leaders should find the time for a vote on the Leahy bill, and the House should pass its own bill without further delay. "
Protecting Electronic Data,"In 2005, ChoicePoint, a data broker, gave access to personal information about more than 140,000 people to criminals posing as businesspeople. Since that widely publicized security breach, many states have passed laws protecting consumer information, but Congress still has not come through. Now, the House is considering a bill to require greater security for personal data. Consumers deserve this sort of protection.    One of the downsides of the technology revolution is that private information is more vulnerable than ever. Security breaches happen on a vast scale. A few years ago, when the laptop computer of an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs  was stolen from his home, the Social Security numbers and dates of birth of more than 25 million veterans and active-duty soldiers were put at risk of theft.   Representative Bobby Rush, an Illinois Democrat and chairman of  the  House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection, is pushing a bill, H.R. 2221, to require companies holding electronic data containing personal information to adhere to security policies established by the Federal Trade Commission. The bill would  require that companies  notify affected individuals when their personal information is breached.   The bill also would strike a blow against companies that compile inaccurate dossiers on consumers. It would require data brokers -- companies that collect and sell consumer data -- to establish procedures for individuals to review the information being held on them and to correct it if it is wrong.   For all of its promise, the bill poses a risk. The vast majority of states now have good data security laws that have forced companies to act more responsibly than they once did. The House bill contains a ''pre-emption'' provision that would wipe out those state laws in the specific areas covered by the  new federal law.   Pre-emption of consumer laws is generally not a good idea. States should be allowed to offer their residents greater protections, and to experiment with new approaches. For the federal law to be worth passing, it must offer more than state laws do.   Mr. Rush's bill has enough going for it -- particularly the provision allowing consumers to correct errors in their data files -- to be a step forward. But as lobbyists for data brokers and other businesses descend on the legislation, it is important that Congress not water down the protections that are in the current bill.  "
Big Breach In Card Data Raises Risk For Millions,"Heartland Payment Systems, a major payment processing company, disclosed a data breach on Monday that potentially exposed tens of millions of credit and debit cardholders to the risk of fraud in what could quickly become one of the country's biggest data compromises.    Robert H. B. Baldwin Jr., Heartland's president and chief financial officer, said that his company believed the card numbers, expiration dates, and in some cases cardholder names were exposed after attacks on its computer systems at the one point where data had been unencrypted.    Once consumers swiped their cards, so-called sniffer software captured that data as Heartland sought authorization from the major payment companies and banks. Customers of Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover Financial were all vulnerable.    ''We have industry-leading encryption, but the data has to be unencrypted to request the information,'' Mr. Baldwin said. ''The sniffer was able to grab that authorization data at that point.''   Data thieves introduced the software as early as May, but Heartland did not detect the breach until it was alerted to the activity in late fall. The personal data of 600 million or more cardholders was vulnerable, but data security experts suggested data from far fewer accounts had been  extracted. Other confidential information, like personal security codes, is not believed to have been compromised. That might limit damages.    Even so, the Heartland breach could wind up rivaling some of the largest data thefts. In January 2007, the discount retail chain TJX revealed that data on more than 45 million customers had been compromised. And 40 million cardholder accounts were exposed in the 2005 data compromise at a tiny payment processor, CardSystem Solutions.   Avivah Litan, a data security analyst, said that the Heartland breach could result in hundreds of millions in losses and other expenses. ''If you add it all up, including legal costs, it could be as much as  half a billion dollars in losses -- or twice as big as TJX,'' she said.    Mr. Baldwin said that Secret Service officials investigating the breach suggested that the thieves involved in the  attack might be part of an ''international ring of hackers that are introducing breaches at a number of financial institutions.''   The Heartland breach also showed that in spite of the adoption of more stringent standards and tougher oversight by banks and credit card companies, consumers are still vulnerable. All this is happening after  credit card companies and merchants spent over $2 billion on establishing the Payment Card Industry standards, Ms. Litan said. ''And yet the breaches continue and they get more serious.''   Heartland, based in Princeton, N.J., works with about 175,000 small merchants and processes about 100 million transactions a month. It has created a Web site, 2008breach.com, to provide information about the incident. Cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized fraudulent charges.  "
Secret Code Protecting Most Cellular Calls Is Deciphered and Published,"A German computer engineer said Monday that he had deciphered and published the secret code used to encrypt most of the world's digital mobile phone calls, saying it was his  attempt to expose weaknesses in the security of global wireless systems.   The action by the encryption expert, Karsten Nohl, aimed to question the effectiveness of the 21-year-old G.S.M. algorithm, a code developed in 1988 and still used to protect the privacy of 80 percent of mobile calls worldwide. (The abbreviation stands for global system for mobile communication.)    ''This shows that existing G.S.M. security is inadequate,'' Mr. Nohl, 28, told about 600 people attending the Chaos Communication Congress, a four-day conference of computer hackers that runs through Wednesday in Berlin. ''We are trying to push operators to adopt better security measures for mobile phone calls.''   The G.S.M. Association, the industry group based in London that devised the algorithm and represents wireless companies, called Mr. Nohl's efforts illegal and said they overstated the security threat to wireless calls.   ''This is theoretically possible but practically unlikely,'' said Claire Cranton, an association spokeswoman. She said no one else had broken the code since its adoption. ''What he is doing would be illegal in Britain and the United States. To do this while supposedly being concerned about privacy is beyond me.''   Some security experts disagreed. While the disclosure does not by itself threaten the security of voice data, one analyst said companies and governmental organizations should take the same steps to ensure the security of their wireless conversations as they do with antivirus software for computer files.   ''Organizations must now take this threat seriously and assume that within six months their organizations will be at risk unless they have adequate measures in place to secure their mobile phone calls,'' said Stan Schatt, a vice president for health care and security at the technology market researcher ABI Research in New York.   Mr. Nohl, who has a doctorate in computer engineering from the University of Virginia, is a widely consulted encryption expert who waged a similar campaign this year that prodded the DECT Forum, a standards group based in Bern, to upgrade the security algorithm for 800 million cordless home phones.   Mr. Nohl has now set his sights on G.S.M., whose second-generation digital technology is still the most widely used wireless-communications standard in the world. About 3.5 billion of the world's 4.3 billion wireless connections use G.S.M.; it is used by about 299 million consumers in North America.   In August, at a hackers' forum in Amsterdam, Mr. Nohl challenged other computer hackers to help him crack the G.S.M. code. He said about 24 people, some members of the Chaos Computer Club, which is based in Berlin, worked independently to generate the necessary volume of random combinations until they reproduced the G.S.M. algorithm's code book -- a vast log of binary codes that could theoretically be used to decipher G.S.M. phone calls.   During an interview, Mr. Nohl said he took precautions to remain within legal boundaries, emphasizing that his efforts to crack the G.S.M. algorithm were purely academic, kept within the public domain, and that the information was not used to decipher a digital call.   ''We are not recommending people use this information to break the law,'' Mr. Nohl said. ''What we are doing is trying to goad the world's wireless operators to use better security.''   Mr. Nohl said the algorithm's code book was available on the Internet through services like BitTorrent, which some people use to download vast quantities of data like films and music. He declined to provide a Web link to the code book, for fear of the legal implications, but said its location had spread by word of mouth.   The G.S.M. algorithm, technically known as the A5/1 privacy algorithm, is a binary code -- which is made exclusively of 0's and 1's -- that has kept digital phone conversations private since the G.S.M. standard was adopted in 1988.   But the A5/1 algorithm is a 64-bit binary code, the modern standard at the time it was developed, but simpler than the 128-bit codes used today to encrypt calls on third-generation networks. The new codes have twice as many 0's and 1's.   In 2007, the G.S.M. Association developed a 128-bit successor to the A5/1, called the A5/3 encryption algorithm, but most network operators have not yet invested to make the security upgrade.   The  encryption key itself does not enable surveillance of mobile calls, which must still be overheard and identified from the digital stream of thousands of calls transmitted through a single cellphone station.   The undertaking is complex because a digital call typically hops among up to 60 different broadcast frequencies during a single conversation, as the mobile network operator maximizes the use of its available bandwidth.   In a statement, the G.S.M. Association said efforts to crack the algorithm were more complex than critics have asserted, and that operators, by simply modifying the existing algorithm, could thwart any unintended surveillance.   The group  said that hackers intent on illegal eavesdropping would need a radio receiver system and signal processing software to process raw radio data, much of which is copyrighted.   But Mr. Nohl, during a presentation Sunday to attendees at the Berlin conference, said the hardware and software needed for digital surveillance were available free as an open-source product in which the coding is available for individuals to tailor to their needs.   Simon Bransfield-Garth, the chief executive of Cellcrypt, a company based in London that sells software, said Mr. Nohl's efforts could put sophisticated mobile interception technology -- limited to governments and intelligence agencies -- within the reach of ''any reasonable well-funded criminal organization.''   ''This will reduce the time to break a G.S.M call from weeks to hours,'' Mr. Bransfield-Garth said during an interview. ''We expect as this further develops it will be reduced to minutes.'' "
U.S. AND RUSSIA DIFFER ON TREATY FOR CYBERSPACE,"The United States and Russia are locked in a fundamental dispute over how to counter the growing threat of cyberwar attacks that could wreak havoc on computer systems and the Internet.    Both nations agree that cyberspace is an emerging battleground. The two sides are expected to address the subject when President Obama visits Russia next week and at the General Assembly of the United Nations in November, according to a senior State Department official.    But there the agreement ends.    Russia favors an international treaty along the lines of those negotiated for chemical weapons and has pushed for that approach at a series of meetings this year and in public statements by a high-ranking official.     The United States argues that a treaty is unnecessary. It instead advocates improved cooperation among international law enforcement groups. If these groups cooperate to make cyberspace more secure against criminal intrusions, their work will also make cyberspace more secure against military campaigns, American officials say.    ''We really believe it's defense, defense, defense,'' said the State Department official, who asked not to be identified because authorization had not been given to speak on the record.  ''They want to constrain offense. We needed to be able to criminalize these horrible 50,000 attacks we were getting a day.''   Any agreement on cyberspace presents special difficulties because the matter touches on issues like censorship of the Internet, sovereignty and rogue actors who might not be subject to a treaty.    United States officials say the disagreement over approach has hindered international law enforcement cooperation, particularly given that a significant proportion of the attacks against American government targets are coming from China and Russia.    And from the Russian perspective, the absence of a treaty is permitting a kind of arms race with potentially dangerous consequences.   Officials around the world recognize the need to deal with the growing threat of cyberwar. Many countries, including the United States, are developing weapons for it, like ''logic bombs'' that can be hidden in computers to halt them at crucial times or damage circuitry; ''botnets'' that can disable or spy on Web sites and networks; or microwave radiation devices that can burn out computer circuits miles away.    The Pentagon is planning to create a military command to prepare for both defense and offensive computer warfare. And last month, President Obama released his cybersecurity strategy and said he would appoint a ''cybersecurity coordinator'' to lead efforts to protect government computers, the air traffic control system and other essential systems. The administration also emphasizes the benefits of building international cooperation.   The Russian and American approaches -- a treaty and a law enforcement agreement -- are not necessarily incompatible. But they represent different philosophical approaches.    In a speech on March 18, Vladislav P. Sherstyuk, a deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council, a powerful body advising the president on national security, laid out what he described as Russia's bedrock positions on disarmament in cyberspace. Russia's proposed treaty would ban a country from secretly embedding malicious codes or circuitry that could be later activated from afar in the event of war.   Other Russian proposals include the application of humanitarian laws banning attacks on noncombatants and a ban on deception in operations in cyberspace -- an attempt to deal with the challenge of anonymous attacks. The Russians have also called for broader international government oversight of the Internet.    But American officials are particularly resistant to agreements that would allow governments to censor the Internet, saying they would provide cover for totalitarian regimes. These officials also worry that a treaty would be ineffective because it can be almost impossible to determine if an Internet attack originated from a government, a hacker loyal to that government, or a rogue acting independently.    The unique challenge of cyberspace is that governments can carry out deceptive attacks to which they cannot be linked,  said Herbert Lin, director of a study by the National Research Council, a private, nonprofit organization, on the development of cyberweapons.   This challenge became apparent in 2001, after a Navy P-3 surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter plane, said Linton Wells II, a former high-ranking Pentagon official who now teaches at the National Defense University. The collision was followed by a huge increase in attacks on United States government computer targets from sources that could not be identified, he said.    Similarly, after computer attacks in Estonia in April 2007 and in the nation of Georgia last August, the Russian government denied involvement and independent observers said the attacks could have been carried out by nationalist sympathizers or by criminal gangs.    The United States is trying to improve cybersecurity by building relationships among international law enforcement agencies. State Department officials hold out as a model the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which took effect in 2004 and has been signed by 22 nations, including the United States but not Russia or China.    But Russia objects that the European convention on cybercrime allows the police to open an investigation of suspected online crime originating in another country without first informing local authorities, infringing on traditional ideas of sovereignty. Vladimir V. Sokolov, deputy director of the Institute for Information Security Issues, a policy organization, noted that Russian authorities routinely cooperated with foreign police organizations when they were approached.   This is not the first time the issue of arms control for cyberspace has been raised.    In 1996, at the dawn of commercial cyberspace, American and Russian military delegations met secretly in Moscow to discuss the subject. The American delegation was led by an academic military strategist, and the Russian delegation by a four-star admiral. No agreement emerged from the meeting, which has not previously been reported.    Later, the Russian government repeatedly introduced resolutions calling for cyberspace disarmament treaties before the United Nations. The United States consistently opposed the idea.   In late April, Russian military representatives indicated an interest in renewed negotiations at a Russian-sponsored meeting on computer security in Garmisch, Germany.   John Arquilla, an expert in military strategy at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., who led the American delegation at the 1996 talks, said he had received almost no interest from within the American military after those initial meetings. ''It was a great opportunity lost,'' he said.   Unlike American officials who favor tightening law enforcement relationships, Mr. Arquilla continues to believe in cyberspace weapons negotiations, he said. He noted that the treaties on chemical weapons had persuaded many nations not to make or stockpile such weapons.   The United States and China have not held high-level talks on cyberwar issues, specialists say. But there is some evidence that the Chinese are being courted by Russia for support of an arms control treaty for cyberspace.    ''China has consistently attached extreme importance to matters of information security, and has always actively supported and participated in efforts by the international community dedicated to maintaining Internet safety and cracking down on criminal cyber-activity,'' Qin Gang, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said in a statement.    Whether the American or Russian approach prevails, arms control experts said, major governments are reaching a point of no return in heading off a cyberwar arms race. "
A New Internet?,"Two decades ago a 23-year-old Cornell University graduate student brought the Internet to its knees with a simple software program that skipped from computer to computer at blinding speed, thoroughly clogging the then-tiny network in the space of a few hours.   The program was intended to be a digital ''Kilroy Was Here.'' Just a bit of cybernetic fungus that would unobtrusively wander the net. However, a programming error turned it into a harbinger heralding the arrival of a darker cyberspace, more of a mirror for all of the chaos and conflict of the physical world  than a utopian refuge from it.   Since then things have gotten much, much worse.    Bad enough that there is a growing belief among engineers and security experts that Internet security and privacy have become so maddeningly elusive that the only way to fix the problem is to start over.    What a new Internet might look like is still widely debated, but one alternative would, in effect, create a ''gated community'' where users would give up their anonymity and certain freedoms in return for safety. Today that is already the case for many corporate and government Internet users. As a new and more secure network becomes widely adopted, the current Internet might end up as the bad neighborhood of cyberspace. You would enter at your own risk and keep an eye over your shoulder while you were there.   ''Unless we're willing to rethink today's Internet,'' says Nick McKeown, a Stanford engineer involved in building a new Internet, ''we're just waiting for a series of public catastrophes.''   That was driven home late last year,  when a malicious software program thought to have been unleashed by a criminal gang in Eastern Europe suddenly appeared after easily sidestepping the world's best cyberdefenses. Known as Conficker, it quickly infected more than 12 million computers, ravaging everything from the computer system at a surgical ward in England to the computer networks of the French military.   Conficker remains a ticking time bomb. It now has the power to lash together those infected computers into a vast supercomputer called a botnet that can be controlled clandestinely by its creators. What comes next remains a puzzle. Conficker could be used as the world's most powerful spam engine, perhaps to distribute software programs to trick computer users into purchasing fake antivirus protection. Or much worse. It might also be used to shut off entire sections of the Internet. But whatever happens, Conficker has demonstrated that the Internet remains highly vulnerable to a concerted attack.   ''If you're looking for a digital Pearl Harbor, we now have the Japanese ships streaming toward us on the horizon,'' Rick Wesson, the chief executive of Support Intelligence, a computer consulting firm, said recently.   The Internet's original designers never foresaw that the academic and military  research network they created would one day bear the burden of carrying all the world's communications and commerce. There was no one central control point and its designers wanted to make it possible for every network to exchange data with every other network. Little attention was given to security. Since then, there have been immense efforts to bolt on security, to little effect.    ''In many respects we are probably worse off than we were 20 years ago,'' said Eugene Spafford, the executive director of the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security at Purdue University and a pioneering Internet security researcher, ''because all of the money has been devoted to patching the current problem rather than investing in the redesign of our infrastructure.''   In fact, many computer security researchers view the nearly two decades of efforts to patch the existing network as a Maginot Line approach to defense, a reference to France's series of fortifications  that proved ineffective during World War II. The shortcoming in focusing on such sturdy digital walls is that once they are evaded, the attacker has access to all the protected data behind them. ''Hard on the outside, with a soft chewy center,'' is the way many veteran computer security researchers think of such strategies.   Despite a thriving global computer security industry that is projected to reach $79 billion in revenues next year, and the fact that in 2002 Microsoft itself began an intense corporatewide effort to improve the security of its software, Internet security has continued to deteriorate globally.   Even the most heavily garrisoned military networks have proved vulnerable. Last November, the United States military command in charge of both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars discovered that its computer networks had been purposely infected with software that may have permitted a devastating espionage attack.    That is why the scientists armed with federal research dollars and working in collaboration with the industry are trying to figure out the best way to start over. At Stanford, where the software protocols for original Internet were designed, researchers are creating a system to make it possible to slide a more advanced network quietly underneath today's Internet. By the end of the summer it will be running on eight campus networks around the country.   The idea is to build a new Internet with improved security and the capabilities to support a new generation of not-yet-invented Internet applications, as well as to do some things the current Internet does poorly -- such as supporting mobile users.   The Stanford Clean Slate project won't by itself solve all the main security issues of the Internet, but it will equip software and hardware designers with a toolkit to make security features a more integral part of the network and ultimately give law enforcement officials more effective ways of tracking criminals through cyberspace. That alone may provide a deterrent.   This is not the first time a replacement has been proposed for the current Internet. For example, modern Windows and Macintosh computers already come equipped to support a new Internet protocol known as IPv6 that would fix many of the shortcomings of the current IPv4 version. However, because of cost, performance and compatibility questions it has languished.   That has not discouraged the Stanford engineers who say they are on a mission to ''reinvent the Internet.'' They argue that their new strategy is intended to allow new ideas to emerge in an evolutionary fashion, making it possible to move data traffic seamlessly to a new networking world. Like the existing Internet, the new network will almost certainly have no one central point of control and no one organization will run it. It is most likely to emerge as new hardware and software are built in to the router computers that run today's network and are adopted as Internet standards.   For all those efforts, though, the real limits to computer security may lie in human nature.   The Internet's current design virtually guarantees anonymity to its users. (As a New Yorker cartoon noted some years ago, ''On the Internet, nobody knows that you're a dog.'') But that anonymity is now the most vexing challenge for law enforcement. An Internet attacker can route a connection through many countries to hide his location, which may be from an account in an Internet cafe purchased with a stolen credit card.   ''As soon as you start dealing with the public Internet, the whole notion of trust becomes a quagmire,'' said Stefan Savage, an expert on computer security at the University of California, San Diego.   A more secure network is one that would almost certainly offer less anonymity and privacy. That is likely to be the great tradeoff for the designers of the next Internet. Oneidea, for example, would be to require the equivalent of drivers' licenses to permit someone to connect to a public computer network. But that runs against the deeply held libertarian ethos of the Internet.   Proving identity is likely to remain remarkably difficult in a world where it is trivial to take over someone's computer from half a world away and operate it as your own. As long as that remains true, building a completely trustable system will remain virtually impossible.  "
"Contractors Vie For Plum Work, Hacking for U.S.","The government's urgent push into cyberwarfare has set off a rush among the biggest military companies for billions of dollars in new defense contracts.   The exotic nature of the work, coupled with the deep  recession, is enabling the companies to attract top young talent that once would have gone to Silicon Valley. And the race to develop weapons that defend against, or initiate, computer attacks has given rise to thousands of ''hacker soldiers'' within the Pentagon who can blend the new capabilities into the nation's war planning.   Nearly all of the largest military companies -- including Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon -- have major cyber contracts with the military and intelligence agencies.   The companies have been moving quickly to lock up the relatively small number of experts with the training and creativity to block the attacks and design countermeasures. They have been buying smaller firms, financing academic research and running advertisements for ''cyberninjas'' at a time when other industries are shedding workers.    The changes are manifesting themselves in highly classified laboratories, where computer geeks in their 20s like to joke that they are hackers with security clearances.    At a Raytheon facility here south of the Kennedy Space Center, a hub of innovation in an earlier era, rock music blares and empty cans of Mountain Dew pile up as engineers create tools to protect the Pentagon's computers and crack into the networks of countries that could become adversaries. Prizes like cappuccino machines and stacks of cash spur them on, and a gong heralds each major breakthrough.   The young engineers represent the new face of a war that President Obama described Friday as ''one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.'' The president said he would appoint a senior White House official to oversee the nation's cybersecurity strategies.    Computer experts say the government is behind the curve in sealing off its networks from threats that are growing more persistent and sophisticated, with thousands of intrusions each day from organized criminals and legions of hackers for nations including Russia and China.   ''Everybody's attacking everybody,'' said Scott Chase, a 30-year-old computer engineer who helps run the Raytheon unit here.    Mr. Chase, who wears his hair in a ponytail, and Terry Gillette, a 53-year-old former rocket engineer, ran SI Government Solutions before selling the company to Raytheon last year as the boom in the military's cyberoperations accelerated.    The operation -- tucked into several unmarked buildings behind an insurance office and a dentist's office -- is doing some of the most cutting-edge work, both in identifying weaknesses in Pentagon networks and in creating weapons for potential attacks.   Daniel D. Allen, who oversees work on intelligence systems for Northrop Grumman, estimated that federal spending on computer security now totals $10 billion each year, including classified programs. That is just a fraction of the government's spending on weapons systems. But industry officials expect it to rise rapidly.    The military contractors are now in the enviable position of turning what they learned out of necessity -- protecting the sensitive Pentagon data that sits on their own computers -- into a lucrative business that could replace some of the revenue lost from cancellations of conventional weapons systems.    Executives at Lockheed Martin, which has long been the government's largest information-technology contractor, also see the demand for greater computer security spreading to energy and health care agencies and the rest of the nation's critical infrastructure. But for now, most companies remain focused on the national-security arena, where the hottest efforts involve anticipating how an enemy might attack and developing the resources to strike back.   Though even the existence of research on cyberweapons was once highly classified, the Air Force plans this year to award the first publicly announced contract for developing tools to break into enemy computers. The companies are also teaming up to build a National Cyber Range, a model of the Internet for testing advanced techniques.   Military experts said Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics, which have long been major players in the Pentagon's security efforts, are leading the push into offensive cyberwarfare, along with the Raytheon unit. This involves finding vulnerabilities in other countries' computer systems and developing software tools to exploit them, either to steal sensitive information or disable the networks.    Mr. Chase and Mr. Gillette said the Raytheon unit, which has about 100 employees, grew out of a company they started with friends at Florida Institute of Technology that concentrated on helping software makers find flaws in their own products. Over the last several years, their focus shifted to the military and intelligence agencies, which wanted to use their analytic tools to detect vulnerabilities and intrusions previously unnoticed.    Like other contractors, the Raytheon teams set up ''honey pots,'' the equivalent of sting operations, to lure hackers into digital cul-de-sacs that mimic Pentagon Web sites. They then capture the attackers' codes and create defenses for them.    And since most of the world's computers run on the Windows or the Linux systems, their work has also provided a growing window into how to attack foreign networks in any cyberwar.   ''It takes a nonconformist to excel at what we do,'' said Mr. Gillette, a tanned surfing aficionado who looks like a 1950s hipster in his T-shirts with rolled-up sleeves.    The company, which would allow interviews with other employees only on the condition that their last names not be used because of security concerns, hired one of its top young workers, Dustin, after he won two major hacking contests and dropped out of college. ''I always approach it like a game, and it's been fun,'' said Dustin, now 22.   Another engineer, known as Jolly, joined Raytheon in April after earning a master's degree in computer security at DePaul University in Chicago. ''You think defense contractors, and you think bureaucracy, and not necessarily a lot of interesting and challenging projects,'' he said.    The Pentagon's interest in cyberwarfare has reached ''religious intensity,'' said Daniel T. Kuehl, a military historian at the National Defense University. And the changes carry through to soldiers being trained to defend and attack computer and wireless networks out on the battlefield.   That shift can be seen in the remaking of organizations like the Association of Old Crows, a professional group that includes contractors and military personnel.    The Old Crows have deep roots in what has long been known as electronic warfare -- the use of radar and radio technologies for jamming and deception.   But the financing for electronic warfare had slowed recently, prompting the Old Crows to set up a broader information-operations branch last year and establish a new trade journal to focus on cyberwarfare.   The career of Joel Harding, the director of the group's Information Operations Institute, exemplifies the increasing role that computing and the Internet are playing in the military.   A 20-year veteran of military intelligence, Mr. Harding shifted in 1996 into one of the earliest commands that studied government-sponsored computer hacker programs. After leaving the military, he took a job as an analyst at SAIC, a large contractor developing computer applications for military and intelligence agencies.   Mr. Harding estimates that there are now 3,000 to 5,000 information operations specialists in the military and 50,000 to 70,000 soldiers involved in general computer operations. Adding specialists in electronic warfare, deception and other areas could bring the total number of information operations personnel to as many as 88,700, he said.  "
U.S. WEIGHS RISKS OF CIVILIAN HARM IN CYBERWARFARE,"It would have been the most far-reaching case of computer sabotage in history. In 2003, the Pentagon and American intelligence agencies made plans for a cyberattack to freeze billions of dollars in the bank accounts of Saddam Hussein and cripple his government's financial system before the United States invaded Iraq. He would have no money for war supplies. No money to pay troops.    ''We knew we could pull it off -- we had the tools,'' said one senior official who worked at the Pentagon when the highly classified plan was developed.    But the attack never got the green light. Bush administration officials worried that the effects would not be limited to Iraq but would instead create worldwide financial havoc, spreading across the Middle East to Europe and perhaps to the United States.     Fears of such collateral damage are at the heart of the debate as the Obama administration and its Pentagon leadership struggle to develop rules and tactics for carrying out attacks in cyberspace.    While the Bush administration seriously studied computer-network attacks, the Obama administration is the first to elevate cybersecurity -- both defending American computer networks and attacking those of adversaries -- to the level of a White House director, whose appointment is expected in coming weeks.   But senior White House officials remain so concerned about the risks of unintended harm to civilians and damage to civilian infrastructure in an attack on computer networks that they decline any official comment on the topic. And senior Defense Department officials and military officers directly involved in planning for the Pentagon's new ''cybercommand'' acknowledge that the risk of collateral damage is one of their chief concerns.    ''We are deeply concerned about the second- and third-order effects of certain types of computer network operations, as well as about laws of war that require attacks be proportional to the threat,'' said one senior officer.    This officer, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the work, also acknowledged that these concerns had restrained the military from carrying out a number of proposed missions.  ''In some ways, we are self-deterred today because we really haven't answered that yet in the world of cyber,'' the officer said.   In interviews over recent weeks, a number of current and retired White House officials, Pentagon civilians and military officers disclosed details of classified missions -- some only considered and some put into action -- that illustrate why this issue is so difficult.    Although the digital attack on Iraq's financial system was not carried out, the American military and its partners in the intelligence agencies did receive approval to cripple Iraq's military and government communications systems in the early hours of the war in 2003. And that attack did produce collateral damage.   Besides blowing up cellphone towers and communications grids, the offensive included electronic jamming and digital attacks against Iraq's telephone networks. American officials also contacted international communications companies that provided satellite phone and cellphone coverage to Iraq to alert them to possible jamming and to ask their assistance in turning off certain channels.    Officials now acknowledge that the communications offensive temporarily disrupted telephone service in countries around Iraq that shared its cellphone and satellite telephone systems. That limited damage was deemed acceptable by the Bush administration.   Another such event took place in the late 1990s, according to a former military researcher. The American military attacked a Serbian telecommunications network and accidentally affected the Intelsat satellite communications system, whose service was hampered for several days.    These missions, which remain highly classified, are being scrutinized today as the Obama administration and the Pentagon move into new arenas of cyberoperations. Few details have been reported previously; mention of the proposal for a digital offensive against Iraq's financial and banking systems appeared with little notice on Newsmax.com, a news Web site, in 2003.   The government concerns evoke those at the dawn of the nuclear era, when questions of military effectiveness, legality and morality were raised about radiation spreading to civilians far beyond any zone of combat.   ''If you don't know the consequences of a counterstrike against innocent third parties, it makes it very difficult to authorize one,'' said James Lewis, a cyberwarfare specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.   But some military strategists argue that these uncertainties have led to excess caution on the part of Pentagon planners.   ''Policy makers are tremendously sensitive to collateral damage by virtual weapons, but not nearly sensitive enough to damage by kinetic'' -- conventional -- ''weapons,'' said John Arquilla, an expert in military strategy at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. ''The cyberwarriors are held back by extremely restrictive rules of engagement.''   Despite analogies that have been drawn between biological weapons and cyberweapons, Mr. Arquilla argues that ''cyberweapons are disruptive and not destructive.''   That view is challenged by some legal and technical experts.   ''It's virtually certain that there will be unintended consequences,'' said Herbert Lin, a senior scientist at the National Research Council and author of a recent report on offensive cyberwarfare. ''If you don't know what a computer you attack is doing, you could do something bad.''   Mark Seiden, a Silicon Valley computer security specialist who was a co-author of the National Research Council report, said, ''The chances are very high that you will inevitably hit civilian targets -- the worst-case scenario is taking out a hospital which is sharing a network with some other agency.''    And while such attacks are unlikely to leave smoking craters, electronic attacks on communications networks and data centers could have broader, life-threatening consequences where power grids and critical infrastructure like water treatment plants are increasingly controlled by computer networks.   Over the centuries, rules governing combat have been drawn together in customary practice as well as official legal documents, like the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations Charter. These laws govern when it is legitimate to go to war, and set rules for how any conflict may be waged.    Two traditional military limits now are being applied to cyberwar: proportionality, which is a rule that, in layman's terms, argues that if you slap me, I cannot blow up your house; and collateral damage, which requires militaries to limit civilian deaths and injuries.   ''Cyberwar is problematic from the point of view of the laws of war,'' said Jack L. Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School. ''The U.N. Charter basically says that a nation cannot use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any other nation. But what kinds of cyberattacks count as force is a hard question, because force is not clearly defined.''   Computers, indispensable in peace, are becoming ever more important in political conflicts and open warfare.

Q & A,"Lock a Drive   On a Keychain   Q.Is it possible to password-protect a U.S.B. drive?   A. If you already have the drive, an encryption utility program will let you lock it up. Many of these programs are aimed at business users who need to protect confidential corporate information; check out pgp.com for software for sale. Companies that make antivirus and security software may have drive-encryption options for sale as well.   Or consider shareware from a reputable site or a free open-source solution like TrueCrypt (truecrypt.org). TrueCrypt, with versions available to download for Windows XP and Vista, Mac OS X and Linux, can encrypt the entire U.S.B. drive. Although some open-source software projects tend to get a little technical for new users, the TrueCrypt site has an illustrated beginners' tutorial and answers to frequently asked questions.    If you are shopping for a new U.S.B. drive, several models have security measures built in. Kingston, Verbatim and SanDisk all have their own variations on the secure U.S.B. drive; prices will probably be higher than those for regular U.S.B. drives. For the deeply security-minded, IronKey (ironkey.com) makes waterproof, tamperproof U.S.B. drives with military-grade encryption software; the one-gigabyte ''personal'' model costs $79.   The ComputerWorld site reviewed seven brands of secure U.S.B. drives last year and has a head-to-head assessment at snipurl.com/ayje4.   Minimovies    By E-mail   Q.My digital camera can take short video clips, but the files are huge. Is there a way to slim these movies down so I can send them around to friends and family by e-mail?   A. Try importing the video clips into a movie-editing program first. Even if you don't have a fancy third-party video editing program on your computer, odds are the machine came with one, like Windows MovieMaker on the PC or iMovie on the Macintosh. Windows users can also try out Pinnacle VideoSpin (videospin.com); it's free to use, but you may need to buy additional software from the site to save finished movies in certain formats.   If the camera uses a video format that your program doesn't import, you can find video-format converter programs at most shareware sites, like download.com, that can translate the clip into a form your video editing program can accept.   Once a video clip is imported into a movie program, it can be edited as needed. When the clip is ready, check the program's menu for output or export options. Many programs offer an ''e-mail'' option; choosing it converts the clip to a size that is acceptable to most e-mail systems.   If you find the video quality suffers too much from the conversion process, try saving the clip as a ''Web quality'' file and uploading it to a video-sharing site that offers password-protection for better privacy, like Vimeo (vimeo.com). Then you need only send a link by e-mail to your friends and family.

"For Symantec and McAfee, 'Arms Race' for Security","The two leading makers of computer security software, Symantec and McAfee, are like preachers who conduct dueling tent revivals.    They boast and frighten and denounce  each other while trying to convince the crowd that their particular brand of salvation will ward off the devil -- in this case, malicious e-mail viruses and evil Internet worms.     The stakes are huge: millions of global followers willing to donate a steady sum every year for protection against online threats.    Recently, the competition between the two has become fiercer, as both have tried to get their software tied to more new personal computers, Web sites and Internet service providers. McAfee has been particularly aggressive, using a string of deals with large PC makers in a bid to usurp Symantec's leadership position.     ''It's like an arms race,'' said Albert A. Pimentel, the chief financial officer of McAfee, who goes by the pugilistic nickname Rocky. Security companies must constantly persuade customers and partners to renew subscriptions or switch from a competitor with similar products.   For years, McAfee served as a self-defeating also-ran, cleaning up the scraps left by Symantec. The company, based in Santa Clara, suffered from a decade of legal and accounting problems that left it in poor competitive shape, and employee morale low.    Things, however, have changed in the last two years since David G. DeWalt left his post as head of sales at the storage company EMC to run McAfee, succeeding George Samenuk, who stepped down in a stock-option backdating scandal. Under Mr. DeWalt, the company has expanded well beyond antivirus software, acquired some niche security players and increased sales to consumers and large businesses.    McAfee is poised to overtake Symantec next year in sales to the business market if current trends hold.    Symantec, based in Cupertino, Calif., remains the overall security market leader, with just about double the market share of McAfee, according to the research firm Gartner.    In the consumer market, Symantec holds an even larger lead, with 52 percent share and $1.8 billion in revenue last year, compared with 18 percent of the market and $624 million in revenue for McAfee. A host of smaller players like Trend Micro, CA and Kaspersky Lab round out the field.   ''It is really Symantec and the seven dwarfs,'' said Enrique T. Salem, the chief executive of Symantec.    In a bold and somewhat risky bid to raise its stature with consumers, McAfee has tried to win over PC makers with something they all like: lots of  cash. In the last year, it spent $55 million, more than any of its rivals, to get McAfee security software preloaded onto new computers. It now counts Dell, Acer, Toshiba, Sony and Lenovo as partners.    ''We are shipping on twice as many computers as the year prior,'' Mr. DeWalt said.    Up to 40 percent of all computers bought by consumers this year will include McAfee's software, the brokerage firm Jefferies & Company estimates.    Hewlett-Packard, the world's largest computer seller, has an exclusive deal with Symantec on its consumer PCs. Mr. DeWalt said that deal should come up for bids within the next year, and Symantec will have to fight to keep it.    ''They didn't have much competition back then, but they will this time,'' he said.   Mr. Salem shrugs off Mr. DeWalt's tough talk. ''I love the rhetoric and the chest-pounding,'' he said.    ''We need to be on as many computers as possible without being irrational,'' Mr. Salem said. If McAfee bids too high, Symantec will walk away from the deal and direct its money toward building some of its other, nonsecurity products, he said.   But, in another breath, Mr. Salem boasts that Symantec has won eight out of the nine PC deals up for bid so far in 2009. Symantec, for example, has chipped away at parts of Dell not covered by McAfee, like gaming PCs.   The payments that both companies make to partners have their own byzantine accounting, and critics complain that the companies are not being straightforward with shareholders.   Quite often, the deals with the PC sellers require the security companies to make upfront payments. Both parties then share revenue over the lifetime of the deal, as some people extend their subscriptions beyond the initial free trial period and begin paying annual fees for the software.    McAfee incurs larger upfront costs than most for its deals while waiting months before it can begin booking subscriptions as revenue. Investors must guess at how many of the trials will turn into actual sales as they weigh the business value of McAfee's payments.    Thus far, it is difficult to tell exactly how successful the payments have been.   Gartner shows McAfee gaining just 0.5 percentage points of market share in the consumer security software market in the last year, with Symantec losing about 4 percentage points.    Mr. DeWalt says McAfee will begin showing more significant market share gains and higher deferred revenue totals as the trial and payment process plays out. ''We haven't seen the full impact of them yet,'' he said.   McAfee says that the upfront payments are small when compared with  the total potential value of the PC deals and that conversion rates have been strong to date. In addition, the company says it has tried to explain the deals to Gradient and characterizes the firm as shaping its research in a sensationalistic way that is meant to attract short-sellers, who sell borrowed shares of a company's stock, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price.   As with many technology companies, McAfee's shares fell in the last year, but at $41 last week, its share price is about the same as prerecession levels.    Executives from McAfee and Symantec say the partner deals are minor items. McAfee makes more money selling corporate security products than consumer products. At $6.2 billion a year in revenue, Symantec is one of the largest software companies in the world.    In addition, both companies are in a part of the market that has done well in the global technology spending slump. According to Gartner, the security software market grew 19 percent last year. McAfee has proved particularly resilient to the downturn, with revenue rising 22 percent last year to $1.6 billion, largely on the back of a more diverse product mix.    One long-term risk for both companies is the popularity of free basic security software packages offered by some vendors, including Symantec's PC Tools brand. In addition, Microsoft, which dominates the overall PC software market, has just released a test version of free security software.    McAfee and Symantec argue that true deliverance from malicious software requires more commitment -- and more money. Both companies try to persuade customers to buy whole suites of security software, including firewalls and online backup services.    ''Last year, we saw a 500 percent increase in malware,'' said Mr. DeWalt.    That's a lot of demons to ward off. "
Cyberattacks Jam Government and Commercial Web Sites in U.S. and South Korea,"A wave of cyberattacks aimed at 27 American and South Korean government agencies and commercial Web sites temporarily jammed more than a third of them over the past five days, and several sites remained stalled or extremely slow on Wednesday.    Officials and computer experts in the United States said that the attacks were unsophisticated and on a relatively small scale, and that their origins had not been determined. They said 50,000 to 65,000 computers had been commandeered by hackers and ordered to flood specific Web sites with access requests, causing them to slow or stall. Such robotic networks, or botnets, can involve more than a million computers.     The Web sites of the  Treasury Department, Secret Service, Federal Trade Commission and Transportation Department  were all affected at some point over the weekend and into this week, The Associated Press reported Tuesday, citing American officials.    A White House spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said in a statement on Wednesday that ''all federal Web sites were back up and running'' by Tuesday night and that the White House site had also been attacked.    He said, ''The preventative measures in place to deal with frequent attempts to disrupt whitehouse.gov's service performed as planned, keeping the site stable and available to the general public, although visitors from regions in Asia may have been affected.''    The Web site of the New York Stock Exchange also came under attack, as well as the sites of Nasdaq, Yahoo's finance section and The Washington Post.    Researchers who are following the attacks said that they began  July 4 and focused on the small group of United States government Web sites, but that the list later expanded to include commercial sites in the United States and then  commercial and government sites in South Korea. Files stored on computers that are part of the attacking system show that 27 Web sites are now targets.   In South Korea, at least 11 major sites have slowed or crashed since Tuesday, including those of the presidential Blue House, the Defense Ministry, the National Assembly, Shinhan Bank, the mass-circulation newspaper Chosun Ilbo and the top Internet portal Naver.com, according to the government's Korea Information Security Agency.   On Wednesday, some of the South Korean sites regained service, but others remained unstable or inaccessible.   ''This is not a simple attack by an individual hacker, but appears to be thoroughly planned and executed by a specific organization or on a state level,'' the South Korean spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, said in a statement, adding that it was cooperating with the American authorities to investigate the attacks.   The  spy agency said the attacks appeared to have been carried out by a hostile group or government, and the news agency Yonhap reported that the agency had implicated North Korea or pro-North Korean groups.   A spokesman at the intelligence agency said it could not confirm the Yonhap report about North Korea's possible role. The opposition Democratic Party accused the spy agency of spreading  rumors to whip up support for an antiterrorism bill that would give it more power.   Although most of the North Korean military's hardware is decrepit, the South Korean authorities have recently expressed concern over possible cyberattacks from the North. In May, South Korean media reported that North Korea was running a cyberwarfare unit that operated through the Chinese Internet network and tried to hack into American and South Korean military networks. United States computer security researchers who have examined the attacking software and watched network traffic played down the sophistication and extent of the attacks.   ''I would call this a garden-variety attack,'' said Jose Nazario, manager of security research at Arbor Networks, a network security firm that is based in Chelmsford, Mass. He said that the attackers were generating about 23 megabits of data a second, not enough to cause major disruptions of the Internet at most of the sites that were being attacked.   ''The code is really pretty elementary in many respects,'' he added. ''I'm doubting that the author is a computer science graduate student.''   As for possible origins, there were only hints. One researcher, Joe Stewart, of Secureworks' Counter Threat Unit in Atlanta, said the attacking software contained the  text string ''get/China/DNS,'' with DNS referring to China's Internet routing system. He said that it appeared that the data generated by the attacking program was based on a Korean-language browser.   Amy Kudwa, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said that the agency was aware of the attacks and that it had   issued a notice to federal departments and agencies, as well as to other partner organizations,  advising them of steps to take to help mitigate attacks.

"Opportunity Knocks For Entrepreneurs, Even in Bad Times","JOB losses, falling property values, more people without health insurance. With the current state of the economy so bleak, those are the issues getting a lot of attention. But they are not the whole picture.   Some entrepreneurs are actually doing well in part because times are hard. This is a story about four of them.    One, Craig Brandman, founder of Medilinq, a provider of medical discounts for low-income people, predicted in a recent interview that his company would  increase the number of its participants by more than sixfold this year, to 200,000 from 30,000 at the end of 2008.    Another is Peter George, the 49-year-old chief executive and part owner of Fidelis Security Systems in Boston, whose company provides protection against data breaches. Mr. George said sales rose 55 percent last year.    And Charles L. Burckmyer and Scott Noll, co-founders of Knob Hill Partners in Boston, are in the enviable position of sitting on about $500,000 in cash and looking for a company to buy at a favorable price in a weak market.   Dr. Brandman, a 60-year-old cardiologist who founded Medilinq in Houston in March 2004,  described the company's target customers as  the working poor and the self-employed who are both uninsured and ineligible for Medicaid. They pay $24.95 a month for steep discounts on medical bills that the company has negotiated and that, he said, ''are competitive with those offered by the Aetnas and the Cignas of the world.''  Health care providers support his product, he said, because the company makes sure  most bills are paid within 10 days, in contrast to the industry average of 75 days, and because it eliminates the paperwork that can eat up 25 percent of their revenue. ''Medilinq is a sort of a Costco and PayPal mode for health care,'' Dr. Brandman said.    As the number of people without access to health care grows and as billing headaches become more acute, he added: ''We're looking at having a big year this year. Economic hard times are a good opportunity for us.''   Mr. George, of Fidelis Security Systems, said that in the past,  companies' loss of digital assets like design documents and marketing plans was generally inadvertent, as the data slipped through holes in the  computer system.   But in a recession, he said, there is an increased chance that disgruntled or laid-off employees might purposely disseminate intellectual property to potential rivals.   ''The big threat to computer systems until now has been hackers from the outside,'' he said. ''Data leakage by insiders is the next big threat, and we can stop it in its tracks.''   Fidelis's  orders jumped  99 percent last year, he said. In 2009,  ''our operating projection is to grow faster.'' Fidelis also hopes to add to its work force in the second half of this year. It  doubled last year to 50.   Skeptics might suppose that the recession would  temper Mr. George's ambitions.  But he says he  joined  the company last March just as it was completing  $22 million in venture capital financing. The timing, he said, was fortuitous  --  or ''plain dumb luck.''  That nest egg should tide the company over for  the next couple of years, eliminating the need to go out again with cup in hand when options for financing are limited, he said.   A partnership with International Business Machines, which markets his products, helps as well,  he said. But however slow the nation's economic recovery might be, he said, he predicts substantial  growth for Fidelis.   There were 19 major data breaches in the United States in January alone, costing companies hundreds of millions of dollars, he said, and the  market to protect against such breaches is expected to grow to $1.2 billion in 2011, from $500 million this year.    ''My ambition is to build this into a $50 million to $100 million company within three years,'' he said.   Mr. Burckmyer and Mr. Noll, both 32 years old and  with entrepreneurial and sales backgrounds, set up Knob Hill Partners last summer  and  persuaded a dozen investors to provide them with a total of $500,000 in operating capital to look  for promising businesses whose owners were interested in selling. They are searching especially for companies with strong growth potential and price tags of  $10 million to  $30 million in energy efficiency, specialty software or information technology. Once they locate a company, they said, their investors are prepared to contribute the funds for them to acquire it and manage it.   With prices falling, the recession is a good time to be shopping for a business. But Mr. Burckmyer and Mr. Noll say  they have a competitive advantage over others  who are prowling the market with the intention of re-engineering a company and flipping it after two or three years.   Typically, owners who have nurtured their ventures for decades ''want to protect continuity,'' Mr. Burckmyer said. ''Their workers are like family to them.'' Unlike the bargain hunters, he said, he and Mr. Noll promise to stay in their new management roles for the long haul and to avoid layoffs if possible.   He cited inconclusive talks the two men held with the owner of an electronics equipment recycling company. ''He wanted somebody who was committed to sticking around,'' he said. ''Once people understand what we're doing, we get a better reception.''   Knob Hill Partners is known as a ''search fund.'' Such funds have been around for a quarter-century, but because they have consistently produced double-digit returns, they are gaining popularity with wealthy people in this recession as  an alternative to stocks, bonds, real estate and other traditional investments.   Mr. Burckmyer and Mr. Noll closed their fund in December when they got enough funds to conduct their search. Once they find a company  they want  --  and what their investors, who are savvy business people and their de facto consultants, also want  --  they will be able to go back to their investors and get the resources to quickly seal a deal.   Nobody enjoys witnessing the pain that the recession is inflicting on ordinary people, Mr. Burckmyer said. Still, the troubled economy offers openings for entrepreneurs with sharp eyes and sharp elbows.   ''We're now in what I humbly concede to be an enviable position of going out to find a business to buy as pricing multiples fall through the floor,'' he said. "
3 Indicted in Theft of 130 Million Card Numbers,"The man who prosecutors said had masterminded some of the most brazen thefts of credit and debit card numbers in history was charged on Monday with an even larger set of digital break-ins.   In an indictment, the Justice Department  said that Albert Gonzalez, 28, of Miami and two unnamed Russian conspirators made off with more than 130 million credit and debit card numbers from late 2006 to early 2008.   Prosecutors called it the largest case of computer crime and identity theft ever prosecuted. According to the government, the culprits infiltrated the computer networks of Heartland Payment Systems, a payment processor in Princeton, N.J.; 7-Eleven Inc.; Hannaford Brothers, a regional supermarket chain; and two unnamed national retailers.     An unspecified portion of the stolen credit and debit card numbers were then sold online, and some were used to make unauthorized purchases and withdrawals from banks, according to the indictment, which was filed in  United States District Court in Newark.    Although some states require card issuers to notify customers about security breaches, it is unclear whether all individuals whose card numbers were stolen in this case have been notified and offered new account numbers.    Mr. Gonzalez has been in custody since May 2008, when he was arrested in connection with another  prominent data theft at the Dave & Buster's restaurant chain. He has also been indicted in other thefts of credit and debt cards, including the 2005 data breach at T.  J. Maxx stores, a division of TJX, based in Framingham, Mass.   Mr. Gonzalez is awaiting a trial in New York in the Dave & Buster's attack and, separately, another in Massachusetts in the TJX breach. Trials on the charges announced on Monday will have to wait until those cases are completed, federal prosecutors said.    Mr. Gonzalez's lawyer, Rene Palomino Jr., did not respond to requests for comment.    Erez Liebermann, an assistant United States attorney in the Justice Department's New Jersey office, said Mr. Gonzalez's involvement in so many data breaches suggested that ''perhaps the individuals capable of such conduct are a tighter-knit group than may have been previously thought.''   Mr. Gonzalez once worked with federal investigators. In 2003, after being arrested in New Jersey in a computer crime, he helped the Secret Service and federal prosecutors in New Jersey identify his former conspirators in the online underworld where credit and debit card numbers are stolen, bought and sold.   But Mr. Gonzalez secretly reconnected with his old associates, federal officials have said, and continued to ply his trade using a variety of online pseudonyms, including Segvec and Cumbajohnny.   According to the new indictment, Mr. Gonzalez and his conspirators reviewed lists of Fortune 500 companies to decide which corporations to take aim at and visited their stores to monitor which payment systems they used. The online attacks took advantage of flaws in the SQL programming language, which is commonly used for databases.    Prosecutors say the defendants created and placed ''sniffer'' programs on corporate networks; the programs intercepted credit card transactions in real time and transmitted the numbers to computers the defendants had leased in the United States, the Netherlands and Ukraine.   The conspirators tried to erase all digital footprints left by their attacks, according to the indictment.    Heartland, one of the world's largest credit and debit card payment processing companies, announced in January that its network had been breached but declined to provide many details. The disclosure came during President Obama's inauguration, which prompted critics to question whether the company was trying to play down the news.   Neither the Department of Justice nor the Secret Service would discuss the investigative breakthroughs in the case. Each defendant faces the possibility of 35 years in prison, and more than $1 million in fines or twice the amount made from the crime, whichever is greater.   Threat Level, a blog run by Wired magazine, reported that Mr. Gonzalez had lived a lavish lifestyle in Miami, once spending $75,000 on a birthday party for himself and complaining to friends that he had to manually count thousands of $20 bills when his counting machine broke.   Richard Wang, manager of SophosLabs, a security company, said the case provided more evidence that retailers and banks needed to strengthen industry standards and encrypt credit card numbers when they are transmitted between computers. Currently, major banks agree to encrypt such data only when it is stored.    Mr. Wang also doubted that the world had seen the last significant theft of credit card numbers.   ''I'm not sure how likely it is that they are going to get the Russian co-conspirators,'' Mr. Wang said. ''Obviously there are still plenty of people with the necessary expertise to pull off these kinds of attacks.'' "
Don't Take This Bait (But You're Safe if You Do),"Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com THE e-mail message from the bank looks real. It isn't.   Law enforcement agencies that oversee computer security are well versed in the many permutations of ''phishing,'' the scam in which fraudsters try to lure people to a counterfeit replica of their bank's Web site, for example, and have them part with their user names and passwords.   But even the professionally wary can be gulled -- or close to it. Just ask Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.    Mr. Mueller recently received an e-mail message that seemed to be from his bank. He clicked on the link and began to follow the instructions to ''verify'' his account information. Before completing the procedure, however, he realized that he had been led to a counterfeit site -- so he left.    It's the aftermath that is of most interest. After Mr. Mueller told his wife about his close call, he said she drew this conclusion from the experience: simply having online access to bank accounts is unacceptably risky.    ''No more Internet banking for you,'' she told him.    The F.B.I. director related the story in a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California in October. ''Too little attention has been paid to cyber threats -- and their consequences,'' Mr. Mueller said that day.    He offered his own experience as a cautionary tale from ''someone who spends a good deal of his professional life warning others about the perils of cybercrime,'' yet who still came close to falling for a scam and ''barely caught himself in time.'' (The story ends there, and an F.B.I. spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined my interview request.)   An audience of civilians would naturally wonder, ''What chance do we have of keeping our pockets from being picked?''   I'm not convinced, however, that online banking carries the high risk that Mr. Mueller implies. I know that as ordinary computer users, we are offered unlimited bait from phishers. But I'm not particularly worried: I'm not on the hook for losses from fraud -- my bank is.   I could not find any online financial service -- and I checked brokerage firms as well as banks -- that stops short of promising to make a victimized customer whole.    Mr. Mueller, encouraging his audience to invest in ''cybersecurity,'' raised a terrifying specter when he spoke of guarding ''against losing everything.'' But how could I suffer ''losing everything'' at the hands of online criminals when my bank has this policy posted on its Web site: ''We guarantee that you will be covered for 100 percent of funds removed from your Wells Fargo accounts in the unlikely event that someone you haven't authorized removes those funds through our Online Services.''   ''Zero liability is now an industry standard,'' said Doug Johnson, vice president for risk management at the American Bankers Association. Restitution is full, and customers do not even have the $50 of exposure that credit card holders risk from unauthorized use of their cards.   Banks, online brokerage firms and payment sites like PayPal, exposed as they all are, would like for us to use more sophisticated security than a password to protect our accounts. One way to combat the phishing threat is to require that online customers supply a second piece of information when they log in, a one-time-only numeric code that is either generated by a little gizmo built for this purpose or is sent to the customer's cellphone.    Your password is ''something you know,'' as security experts describe it, and the temporary security code is ''something you have'' -- and something that a phishing fraudster would not. Requiring two dissimilar things is the essence of ''two-factor authentication.''   Such a system isn't perfect, but one can see why financial institutions would like to have a better lock installed on their front door. These institutions must proceed cautiously, however, lest they scare customers into abandoning online banking. At the moment, banks seem to be offering the security key system principally to customers with business accounts.   Teddy De Rivera, executive vice president in the Internet services group at Wells Fargo, said his bank would roll out its security key system more broadly over the next two years. Wells Fargo plans to require a code not every time a customer logs in, but only when its software detects a suspicious ''high-risk transaction.'' His group had collected feedback from customers who made clear that they ''don't want to have to use it every time,'' he said.   I  SIGNED up to try PayPal's security key system, available to its users on request. Every time I log in, I receive a six-digit code in a text message sent to my phone -- it's easy to type in, but it adds an extra step.    When I asked Michael Vergara, director of risk management at PayPal, whether he recommended that all PayPal customers adopt the security key system, he said, ''If I spend a lot of time going to shadier areas of the Internet, yes.''   ''But if you're talking about my mom, who visits three sites, having an extra level of security when she comes to PayPal is not going to improve her experience,'' he added.   I don't know whether Mr. Mueller at the F.B.I. has persuaded his wife to lift the household ban on online banking. If he hasn't, he should deploy the two words that have the magical power to put the most anxious online bank customer at ease:    Zero liability.  "
A Lawsuit Tries to Get at Hackers Through the Banks They Attack,"A lawsuit filed on Wednesday against some of the most shadowy Internet criminals -- gangs based in Eastern Europe that electronically break into business computers, steal banking passwords and transfer themselves money -- is being used to pry information from a group that is nearly as reclusive as the hackers: banks whose computers have been compromised.   The suit by  Unspam Technologies, which organizes volunteers to track down information about spammers and other online rogues, was filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.     The lawyer for Unspam, Jon L. Praed, concedes he is unlikely ever to discover the names of the hackers. But he hopes to get the details of the thefts, the names of victims and other information from the banks that can be used to improve security and possibly identify the hackers.    Mr. Praed, the head of the Internet Law Group, which is based in Arlington, Va., has used the technique successfully on behalf of AOL and Verizon to identify people sending spam to their customers. The same legal method was used by the recording industry to force Internet providers to name customers who were exchanging copyrighted songs.   More recently, Mr. Praed has used these ''John Doe suits'' --  so called because the unnamed defendant is identified only as John Doe  --  to get information from third parties that can then be passed to law enforcement officials and online security experts and used as the basis for other civil suits.   In 2007, Mr. Praed filed a suit on behalf of Unspam that was aimed at gathering information on illegal Internet pharmacies and the companies that support them. He declined to discuss any actions taken as a result.   The suit filed Wednesday invokes the federal Can-Spam Act because some of the malicious programs that infect corporate computers are sent in the form of attachments to e-mail messages. It is more common these days for computers to become infected when users visit Web sites that have been  secretly taken over by hackers and unknowingly download computer code that then controls their computers.    ''This lawsuit is intended to provide all those being victimized by this massive criminal enterprise the opportunity to come together to gather the data we need to fix the problem at a systems level,'' Mr. Praed said.    Banks, however, may well fight the subpoenas of Mr. Praed.   A number of laws protect the confidentiality of bank customers. Moreover, the banking industry has historically avoided much discussion about fraud cases. Banks argue they do not want to give away the techniques used by criminals or those meant to thwart them. They also want to preserve the confidence of their customers.    ''Banks are not the perpetrators of these crimes, and banks are spending tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of industry dollars trying to prevent those acts from taking place,'' said Scott H. Frewing, a partner at the Baker & McKenzie law firm, which represents major banks.    ''The use of John Doe lawsuits to draw them into a civil litigation fight just raises the cost on the banks in a way that the courts may not sanction.''     The banks also may fight the subpoenas to protect themselves from liability for losses by their corporate customers. While banks generally reimburse money lost by consumers to hackers, they do not  cover losses by business accounts. And the most sophisticated hackers have been increasingly trying to focus on getting access to the accounts of big customers with large balances who wire money to other banks.    These days, hackers infect hundreds of thousands of computers with software that monitors their users, waiting for them to log onto a bank account. The nasty program installed on the computers of victims sends their bank IDs and passwords back to the hackers, who use them to log into the bank accounts.   They do not just bother to attack anyone's account, said Joe Stewart, the director of malware research for SecureWorks, a software company.    ''Now that they have a list of users, they will check all of their balances, and hang tight until they find the big fish,'' he said.    All of that can be automated, so the hackers are alerted once their computers find they have gained access to the computer of someone who controls a lot of money.   Mr. Praed said that he hoped his John Doe lawsuit would encourage banks to improve their electronic defenses.  ''Unless we want to go back to putting our money in a mattress,  more needs to be done.'' "
Control of Cybersecurity Becomes Divisive Issue,"The National Security Agency has been campaigning to lead the government's rapidly growing cybersecurity programs, raising privacy and civil liberties concerns among some officials who fear that the move could give the spy agency too much control over government computer networks.   The Obama administration is expected to complete an internal cybersecurity review on Friday and may publicly announce its new computer-security strategy as early as next week, White House officials said Thursday. That plan will determine the scope of cybersecurity efforts throughout the federal government, they said, as well as which agencies will take leading roles in protecting the government's computer systems.    The security agency's interest in taking over the dominant role has met resistance, including the resignation of the Homeland Security Department official who was until last month in charge of coordinating cybersecurity efforts throughout the government.   Rod Beckstrom, who resigned in March as director of the National Cyber Security Center at the Homeland Security Department, said in an interview that he feared that the N.S.A.'s push for a greater role in guarding the government's computer systems could give it  the power to collect and analyze every e-mail message, text message and Google search conducted by every employee in every federal agency.   Mr. Beckstrom said he believed that an intelligence service that is supposed to focus on foreign targets should not be given so much control over the flow of information within the United States government. To detect threats against the computer infrastructure -- including hackers, viruses and intrusions by foreign agents and terrorists -- cybersecurity guardians must have virtually unlimited access to networks. Mr. Beckstrom argues that those responsibilities should be divided  among agencies.   ''I have very serious concerns about the concentration of too much power in one agency,'' he said. ''Power over information is so important, and it is so difficult to monitor, that we need to have checks and balances.''   Government officials have acknowledged that the  agency has gone beyond the broad limits set by Congress last year for intercepting telephone and e-mail messages of Americans. Leading Democratic and Republican lawmakers and civil liberties groups voiced strong concerns Thursday after The New York Times reported the breach.   Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that ''these are serious allegations, and we will make sure we get the facts.'' The committee plans to hold a closed hearing on the issue soon, Mrs. Feinstein  said.    Representative Silvestre Reyes, the Texas Democrat who leads the House Intelligence Committee, said his panel had already held four closed-door sessions on N.S.A. compliance problems, and he said it would continue to monitor the issue actively. Representative Peter Hoekstra, the Michigan Republican who is the ranking minority member on the committee, complained, though, that the intelligence community had failed to inform Congress of the problem in ''a quick and timely manner.''   Some lawmakers said hearings were not enough. Senator Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who was an outspoken opponent of the legislation that broadened the security agency's wiretapping powers last year, said  the wiretapping problems were part of ''a tragic retreat from the principles that had governed the sensitive area of government surveillance for the previous three decades.''  Mr. Feingold called for reforms in intelligence law as well as the public release of certain aspects of wiretapping operations ''so that the American people can better understand their scope and impact.''   Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence, defended the agency's wiretapping operation in a statement Thursday as ''vital work'' in protecting national security, but he acknowledged that ''on occasion, N.S.A. has made mistakes and intercepted the wrong communications.'' Mr. Blair  said the numbers of such mistakes were ''very small'' in  the agency's vast overall collection efforts, although officials would not quantify how many violations had occurred.   Some experts said Thursday that the disclosure of excessive domestic collection of information by the security agency  served as a warning against giving it greater control over cybersecurity.   ''The N.S.A.'s expertise, which is impressive and very, very deep, is focused primarily on the needs of the military and the intelligence community,'' said Matt Blaze, a computer security expert at the University of Pennsylvania. ''Their track record in dealing with civilian communications security is mixed at best.''   Agency officials declined to comment Thursday, but the N.S.A. -- which has the greatest concentration of computing power and expertise in the government -- has powerful allies in its bid for control. Mr. Blair told Congress recently that he believed the agency  should be given the lead in cybersecurity, arguing that it has the computer ''wizards'' with the skills needed.    In a recent interview, Dale Meyerrose, a retired Air Force general who was the chief information officer for the director of national intelligence until last year, agreed, saying that while intelligence officials need to be mindful of civil liberties concerns in the cybersecurity debate, the N.S.A. must have a leading role in that effort because of its technical expertise.    ''They are probably the premier cybersecurity, cyberorganization in the world,'' General Meyerrose  said.   Like Mr. Beckstrom, others worry about giving a spy agency a virtual monopoly over information security.    ''There is a tremendous amount of expertise at N.S.A.,'' said Amit Yoran, the former director of the cybersecurity division of the Homeland Security Department, ''but I also agree that it would be a significant detriment to the nation to let the N.S.A. be the lead agency running cyberprograms. There is an inherent conflict of interest between their intelligence mission and the mission of the folks doing cyber.'' "
Twitter Hack Raises Flags On Security,"You might think your password protects the confidential information stored on Web sites. But as Twitter executives discovered, that is a dangerous assumption.   The Web was abuzz Wednesday after it was revealed that a hacker had  exposed  corporate information about Twitter after breaking into an employee's e-mail account. The breach raised red flags for individuals as well as businesses about the passwords used to secure  information they store on the Web.    On Web sites containing personal information like e-mail, financial data or documents, there is usually just a user name and password for protection.  More individuals are storing information on Web servers, where it is accessible from any online computer through services offered by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, social networks like Facebook or back-up services like Mozy.     But password-protected sites are growing more vulnerable because to keep up with the growing number of passwords, people use the same simple ones on numerous sites across the Web. In a study last year, Sophos, a security firm, found that 40 percent of Internet users use the same password for every Web site they access.    The attack on Twitter highlights the problem. For its internal documents, the company uses the business version of Google Apps, a service that Google offers to individuals free. Google Apps provides e-mail, word processing, spreadsheets and calendars over the Web.    The content is stored on Google's servers, which can save time and money  and enable employees to work together on documents at the same time. But it also means that the security is only as good as the password. A hacker who breaks into one person's account can access information shared by friends, family members or colleagues, which is what happened at Twitter.    The Twitter breach occurred about a month ago, Twitter said. A hacker calling himself Hacker Croll broke into an administrative employee's e-mail account and gained access to the employee's Google Apps account, where Twitter shares spreadsheets and documents with business ideas and financial details, said Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder.    The hacker then sent  documents about company plans and finances, confidential contracts, and job applicants to two tech news blogs,  TechCrunch, in Silicon Valley, and Korben, in France. There was also  personal information about Twitter employees including credit card numbers.     The hacker also broke into the e-mail account of the wife of Evan Williams, Twitter's chief executive, and from there accessed several of Mr. Williams' personal Internet accounts, including those at Amazon and PayPal, Mr. Stone said.    TechCrunch revealed documents showing that Twitter,  a private company that so far has no revenue, projected that it will reach a billion users and $1.54 billion in revenue by 2013. Michael Arrington, TechCrunch's founder, said in an interview that the hacker had also sent him detailed strategy documents about potential business models, the competitive threat from Facebook and when the company might be acquired.    Some analysts say the breach highlights how dangerous it can be for people and companies to store confidential documents on Web servers, or ''in the cloud.''    But Mr. Stone said that the attack ''isn't about any flaw in Web apps,'' but rather about a bigger issue that affects individuals and businesses alike. ''It speaks to the importance of following good personal security guidelines such as choosing strong passwords,'' he said.    Instead of circumventing security measures, it appears that the Twitter hacker managed to correctly answer the personal questions that Gmail asks of users  to reset the password.    ''A lot of the Twitter users are pretty much living their lives in public,'' said Chris King, director of product marketing at Palo Alto Networks, which creates firewalls. ''If you broadcast all your details about what your dog's name is and what your hometown is, it's not that hard to figure out a password.''    Security experts advise people to use unique, complex passwords for each Web service they use and include a mix of numbers and letters. Free password management programs like  KeePass and 1Password can help people juggle passwords for numerous sites.    Andrew Storms, director of security operations for nCircle, a network security company, suggested choosing false answers to the security questions like ''What was your first phone number?'' or making up obscure questions instead of using the default questions that sites provide. (Of course, that presents a new problem of remembering the false information.)   For businesses, Google allows company administrators to set up rules for password strength and add additional authentication tools like unique codes.    The Twitter hacker claims to have wanted to teach people to be more careful. In a message to Korben, the hacker wrote that his attack could make Internet users ''conscious that no one is protected on the Net.''  "
Obama to Name Chief of Cybersecurity,"Nearly seven months after highlighting the vulnerability of banking, energy and communications systems to Internet attacks, the White House on Tuesday is expected to name a technology industry veteran to coordinate competing efforts to improve the nation's cybersecurity in both military and civilian life.   The decision to appoint Howard A. Schmidt, an industry executive with government experience who served as a cybersecurity adviser in the Bush administration and who also has a military and law enforcement background, is seen as a compromise between factions. Government officials and industry executives say there has been a behind-the-scenes dispute over whether strict new regulations are necessary to protect the network that increasingly weaves together the vast majority of the world's computers.     Mr. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council -- not both to the council and to the National Economic Council, as previously planned, an administration official said on Monday. Mr. Schmidt will also ''have regular access to the president,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he had not been authorized to talk publicly about the appointment.    Cybersecurity has taken on new urgency this year in the face of a growing range of cyberattacks and reports of vulnerabilities in business and military computing systems. Indeed, at the May 29 announcement of his administration's decision to create the position of cybersecurity coordinator, Mr. Obama described how during his presidential campaign computer intruders had ''gained access to e-mails and a range of campaign files, from policy position papers to travel plans.''   ''It was,'' he said, ''a powerful reminder: in this information age, one of your greatest strengths -- in our case, our ability to communicate to a wide range of supporters through the Internet -- could also be one of your greatest vulnerabilities.''   After reviewing the nation's cybersecurity preparedness, the White House said it would create the position of cybersecurity coordinator to harmonize the nation's various efforts to ''deter, prevent, detect and defend'' against cyberattacks.    The administration's decision to appoint Mr. Schmidt was slowed by a tug of war among political, military, intelligence and business interests, said people with direct knowledge of the selection process. Industry officials, for example, have expressed concern that new regulations would dampen innovation.    In recent months the administration has been criticized by lawmakers and others for not moving more quickly to fill the position. Experts on the issue had questioned how effective a cybercoordinator could be if forced to report to two governmental councils without direct access to the president.    ''I've come away with a strong sense that Vivek Kundra, chief information officer, and Aneesh Chopra, the chief technology officer, and participants at the N.S.C. are aligned on this effort,'' said Vinton Cerf, a co-author of the original Internet standards who has been consulted by the administration in choosing a ''cyberczar.''    The White House official also said that criticisms that the administration had been frozen on cybersecurity policies while waiting for the appointment of a cybersecurity chief were inaccurate, citing a range of initiatives now under way at various agencies to improve cybersecurity. In November the White House met with a Russian delegation of cybersecurity officials in an effort to build cooperation on international law enforcement issues.   One significant difference in the Obama administration's approach to cybersecurity and that of the previous administration has been the degree of secrecy about strategy and policy issues. In the Bush administration, cybersecurity decisions were made in a highly classified fashion. What remains unclear, however, is how the new administration will balance cybersecurity decisions between military and civilian organizations.   In May the administration's cybersecurity review was not specific about transforming the administration's goals into practical realities. At the time Mr. Obama did not explain how he planned to go about resolving the running turf wars among the Pentagon, the National Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies over the conduct of defensive and offensive cyberoperations.   Mr. Schmidt is the chief executive officer of the Information Security Forum, a nonprofit computer security trade association based in London. He has served as chief information security officer at eBay and chief security officer at Microsoft. In the Bush administration, he was the vice chairman of the president's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board and a special adviser for cyberspace security.    He also served in the Air Force and the Army in computer security roles and led a computer forensics team for the Federal Bureau of Investigation at the National Drug Intelligence Center. "
China Orders Fixes in Censoring Software,"A designer of censorship software that the Chinese government requires to be preinstalled on computers sold in China has been ordered to fix potential security breaches in the software, the newspaper China Daily reported Monday. The report was an indication that the government still supports use of the software despite heated debate over it.   The software, called Green Dam-Youth Escort, has come under attack by many computer users in China for both political and technical reasons. Critics say that although the Chinese government insists that the software will be used only to block access to pornography Web sites, the software's actual use will be to block any site with content deemed politically objectionable, like the Tibet issue or the 1989 Tiananmen killings.  The government says all computers sold in China must have the software installed by July 1.   Some computer experts who have studied the software said last week that it was so flawed that it could allow hackers to monitor a user's Internet activity, steal personal data or plant viruses. One expert, J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan, has posted on the Internet a report on Green Dam's vulnerabilities.   Rather than agreeing to scrap the software altogether, the Chinese government has responded to the technical criticisms by ordering that the potential security breaches be eliminated.   ''The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology told us to make the software safer as soon as a series of security vulnerabilities were found,'' Zhang Chenmin, the general manager of Jinhui Computer System Engineering, which helped design the software, told China Daily.   Mr. Zhang admitted that the software had systemic flaws that would allow hackers to attack computers that used the program, ''just like any other software of this type.''   Mr. Halderman said in an interview last week that it had only taken a few hours for him and his students to infiltrate a computer loaded with Green Dam and force it to crash. A skilled hacker could take over the computer to mine personal data or hitch it to other infected machines in a malevolent network known as a botnet, he added.   Debate about the software exploded on the Internet last week as Chinese Internet users increasingly learned about the software requirement issued by the ministry. China Daily reported Monday that surveys done by four of China's most popular Web portals showed that four in five Internet users would not use the software or would have it uninstalled.   Early reports had indicated that the government might simply require Green Dam to be included on a CD packaged with new computers, so users would have the option to install it. But it became apparent last week that the government was insisting that all computer makers preinstall the software by July 1. Foreign computer makers learned of the directive just three weeks ago and have been asking the Chinese government to reconsider the rules.    Meanwhile, Solid Oak Software, a company based in Santa Barbara, Calif., has accused the designers of Green Dam of stealing programming code from software called Cybersitter that was developed by Solid Oak. Cybersitter is designed to block Web sites deemed to be pornographic, violent or offensive. Solid Oak says that some of the ''blacklist'' files used by Green Dam were originally developed for Cybersitter.   ''I cannot deny that the two filters' databases of blacklisted URL addresses might share similarities,'' Mr. Zhang said in China Daily. ''After all, they are all well-known international pornographic Web sites that all porn filters are meant to block. But we didn't steal their programming code.'' "
Call for White House Control of Security,"The  federal official in charge of a  review of the nation's strategy for improving Internet and computer security said Wednesday that the White House needed to step in and take control of the nation's cybersecurity policy.    ''It requires leading from the top: from the White House, to departments and agencies, state, local, tribal governments, the C-Suite, and to the local classroom and library,'' said the official, Melissa Hathaway, who was named acting senior director for cyberspace by President Obama and given responsibility for a 60-day review of the issues surrounding cyberspace threats.   The creation of such a White House office was called for last year by a bipartisan group of politicians, technologists and cybersecurity specialists who wrote in a report that the nation's computer security systems had reached a crisis point and that a White House ''czar'' was needed to focus on instituting both new technologies and new policies.   Cybersecurity specialists welcomed the administration's decision to put the security issue at the fore, but they emphasized that the review, which is likely to be made public this week, is simply the opening round in what may become a bruising political battle over how much control should be exercised and over which agencies of the government will take command of computer security.   ''There is still a lot of fighting within the White House,'' said James A. Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the director of the study ''Security Cyberspace for the 44th Presidency,'' issued last November.   There are now at least three camps involved in the decision that the president will make about control of cybersecurity, Mr. Lewis said: traditional national security policy analysts who are not focused on the cyberthreat; intelligence and military agencies that are seeking to consolidate power and influence over cyberpolicy; and an influential group that has said stricter cybersecurity regulations could damage innovative Internet industries associated with Silicon Valley.   ''We didn't expect the Googles of the world coming in and saying, this makes us nervous,'' he said.    Several former government executives said they saw the early influence of the Obama administration on Ms. Hathaway's speech.   ''I was pleased to see an emphasis on collaborative values in working with our international partners and a new emphasis on investing in research and development,'' said Rod Beckstrom, who resigned last month as director of the National Cybersecurity Center and warned about the growing influence of the National Security Agency over cybersecurity efforts by the federal government.   Independently, the Pentagon is considering ways to consolidate its efforts for cyberwarfare under one headquarters, with the leading proposal being to create an organization within a current military command. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, in a speech last week,  said he was examining proposals for a new cyberheadquarters within the military's Strategic Command, known as Stratcom, which already has a significant military role in computer network defenses.    ''One of the things that I'm looking at is establishing a sub-unified command at Stratcom for cyber,'' Mr. Gates said.   Senior Defense Department officials said current proposals did not envision creating a wholly separate command for cyberwarfare, nor in putting one individual armed service in charge. "
A Digital Storage Option for Workers on the Go,"E-mail: novelties@nytimes.com STEVE ASH,  who writes software for banks, used to ferry his digital files from the office to grad school to home on a U.S.B. stick. But it wasn't a method he liked.    ''Everything was on it,'' he said of the device. ''God forbid it would get lost, stolen or dropped in the mud.''   So Mr. Ash, who is 25 and lives in Memphis, checked out new services, including Syncplicity  and Dropbox, that automatically synchronize his digital files and folders across multiple computers. That way, if he leaves work in the middle of drafting a report on his desktop, the draft will be waiting for him on his bedroom computer when he gets home -- with no memory stick necessary.     Syncplicity, Dropbox and similar data management services work by piping up data from a customer's computers to the ''cloud storage'' of Internet servers, saving the information there and then downloading it to the user's other computers.   The services are intended to work automatically, in the background. ''Every time you have an active Internet connection, Syncplicity will sync and back up all of your computers,'' said Leonard Chung, the chief executive of the company, which is based in San Francisco. The program even synchronizes files if users are, for instance, preparing a report at Google Docs, the Web-based word processor. ''It will capture that report and put it onto your machines as a Word document,'' he said.   Syncplicity and Dropbox also provide file-sharing among groups. When one person using Syncplicity makes changes in a joint proposal or a spreadsheet and hits ''save,'' the file is quickly backed up and then downloaded to colleagues' computers with the saved changes, Mr. Chung said.   To ensure data security, Syncplicity uses the same kind of encryption employed by the military and banks, said Justin Huskamp, manager of business development. ''Everything that is sitting in our database is encrypted,'' he said.   At Dropbox, all data is encrypted using the same practices that banks use. ''Security is the most important concern on our users' minds and ours as well,'' said Drew Houston, co-founder and chief executive of the company, also based in San Francisco.    Jonathan B. Spira,  chief analyst at Basex,  a business research firm in New York City, said that while the combination of synching, file-sharing and backup in the new programs might not be useful for big companies that already have elaborate information management systems, it would be helpful for those on tighter budgets -- freelancers and workers at small companies, for example.   ''They need tools that will ensure that files are not lost and that everyone is using the same version'' across many computers, he said.    ''The great benefit from a system like Syncplicity is that it pretty much works in the background,'' he said. Workers, he said, ''don't have to engage in any heavy lifting'' to use the programs.   Service is free for up to two  gigabytes of storage at both Syncplicity and Dropbox. Both companies charge $9.99  a month or $99  a year for up to 50  gigabytes.    Syncplicity is designed for Windows users. A version for Macs will be released shortly, Mr. Chung said.    Dropbox, which is now in beta, or test, version, works with Macs and Linux-based systems as well as with PCs.    Mr. Ash chose Syncplicity to manage his data. ''Having it online and knowing it's there is worth paying for,'' he said.    Jeff Rudluff  of Dallas,  a general partner in onlineperformancemarketing.com, an advertising firm, uses Syncplicity to unite the laptop and desktop computers of the nine employees in the business, each of whom works from home. ''We don't have a central server, but now we can share folders anyway,'' he said. ''When I make a change to a proposal, it's automatically entered, so then, when anyone on the team goes to it, they have the latest document.''   In the past, he said, the company used a backup program to save data, but the procedure didn't work. ''You had to remember'' to do the backup, he said. ''But people didn't.''    The company has had three computer crashes recently, but because of Syncplicity, no files have been lost, he said. ''Everything was in cloud storage,'' he said, ''and could be quickly downloaded onto replacement computers.''   Mr. Rudluff especially likes having multiple versions of documents like spreadsheets available to him. ''The really cool thing is that the program saves earlier versions of your document,'' he said, instead of overwriting the original files as people changed the text. ''If we make a fundamental mistake, we can go back to what we had before,'' he said. Both Dropbox and Syncplicity offer this feature.   Mr. Houston of Dropbox said the service made it easy for people with ordinary, nontechie backgrounds to synchronize their files. ''Just install the program and enter your e-mail and password,'' he said. Files are also easily shared, he said. ''You click on the folder, click 'share,' and type in the e-mail addresses of collaborators.'' Then that folder appears on everyone else's computers. ''Anyone can make changes,'' he said, and the changes appear instantly on everyone's computers, too.   ''We've found that companies are living out of these shared folders,'' Mr. Houston said. ''They are using them as an alternative to lots of e-mails and attachments.''  "
Professor Main Target Of Assault On Twitter,"The cyberattacks Thursday and Friday on Twitter and other popular Web services disrupted the lives of hundreds of millions of Internet users, but the principal target appeared to be one man: a 34-year-old economics professor from the republic of Georgia.   During the assault -- the latest eruption in a yearlong skirmish between nationalistic hackers in Russia and Georgia -- unidentified attackers sent millions of spam e-mail messages and bombarded Twitter, Facebook and other services with junk messages. The blitz was an attempt to block the professor's Web pages, where he was revisiting the events leading up to the brief territorial war between Russia and Georgia that began a year ago.    The attacks were ''the equivalent of bombing a TV station because you don't like one of the newscasters,'' Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer of the Internet security firm F-Secure, said in a blog post. ''The amount of collateral damage is huge. Millions of users of Twitter, LiveJournal and Facebook have been experiencing problems because of this attack.''     The blogger, a refugee from  the Abkhazia region, a territory on the Black Sea disputed between Russia and Georgia, writes under the name Cyxymu,   but identified himself only by the name Giorgi in a telephone interview. Giorgi, who said he taught at Sukhumi State University, first noticed Thursday afternoon that LiveJournal, a popular blogging platform, was not working for him. ''I decided to go to Facebook,'' he said. ''And Facebook didn't work. Then I went to Twitter, and Twitter didn't work. 'How strange,' I thought, 'What a coincidence they all don't work at once.' ''   Security experts say that it is nearly impossible to determine who exactly is behind the attack, which disrupted access to Twitter, Facebook, LiveJournal and some Google sites on Thursday and continued to affect many Twitter users into Friday evening.    But Beth Jones, an analyst with the Internet security firm Sophos, said the assault occurred in two stages.    Early Thursday, the attackers sent out a wave of spam under the name Cyxymu, which is a Latin transliteration of the Cyrillic name of the capital of Abkhazia, Sukhumi. This technique, a ''joe job,'' is intended to discredit a Web user by making him appear to be the source of a large amount of junk e-mail. ''These hackers wanted to make him look responsible for millions of spam e-mails,'' said Ms. Jones.    The messages contained links to Giorgi's accounts on several social networks and Web sites, including  Twitter.     The next leg of the attack, Ms. Jones said, was a distributed denial of service, or D.D.O.S., attack aimed at knocking Giorgi off the Web. The hackers used a botnet, a network of thousands of malware-infected personal computers, to direct huge amounts of junk traffic to Cyxymu's pages on Twitter, LiveJournal, YouTube and Facebook in an attempt to disable them, Ms. Jones said.    The junk messages overwhelmed the services, slowing them, and in the case of Twitter and LiveJournal, shutting them down entirely for a time.    Giorgi said his pages were providing a place for refugees from Abkhazia to exchange memories of their home. The Twitter page had a sepia photograph of a palm-lined city street. ''It was nostalgia,'' he said.   This week, he began posting day-by-day accounts of the run-up to the conflict that drew partly on posts from his readers inside of Abkhazia, who he said had been describing how the Russian army staged its forces in the region in early August 2008.   ''I feel a bit ashamed for the people who lost service because my blog was blocked,'' said Giorgi.    The hundreds of millions of Internet users affected were simply ''collateral damage,'' said Ms. Jones.   The attacks and their aftermath show just how vital Web tools and services are becoming to political discourse -- and how vulnerable they are to disruption.    ''They aren't set up to play the role of a global communications network, but very quickly they've come to represent that,'' said John Palfrey, a law professor and co-director of Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.    The attacks that felled Twitter shed light on the fragility of the popular microblogging service, especially compared to its competitor Facebook, which quickly recovered from the pummeling, said Stefan Tanase, a researcher at Kaspersky Lab, an Internet security firm. Twitter, a small San Francisco company, has been struggling to improve its security even as it tries to manage hypergrowth in the number of users and messages it handles.    But, Mr. Tanase said, ''Twitter is definitely a company that is learning fast and reacting fast.''   The outage frustrated many Twitter users. Some migrated over to better-functioning social networks like Facebook and FriendFeed to send messages and follow conversations, said Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst at Forrester Research and a prolific tweeter.    ''If Twitter goes down or shuts down permanently, the conversation just shifts somewhere else,'' he said.    For others, solving the problem wasn't quite as simple.    Soren Macbeth, founder and chief executive of StockTwits, a service that lets investors trade news and information about companies, said his service, which is built on Twitter's infrastructure, was offline Thursday and still hadn't fully recovered Friday.   ''Having the service be intermittent is almost worse than having it be totally down,'' he said. ''It makes it seem more like our issue, a problem with our service.''    Mr. Macbeth said the service, which receives as many as 10,000 postings a day, had been at Twitter's mercy since its inception. ''It's very challenging to run a business on top of Twitter,'' he said.  The difficulties of working with Twitter had already prompted StockTwits to begin developing a stand-alone platform, which the company plans to introduce on Sept. 1.    But for most businesses, Twitter is merely a supplemental marketing tool.    Ben Van Leeuwen, who runs trucks that serve scoops of ice cream to customers around New York City, said he didn't even notice the service was down. ''Sales were the same yesterday as they were the day before,'' he said.   Aaron Magness, who heads up new business development and marketing at Zappos.com, an online shoe retailer with a sizable following on Twitter, said in an e-mail message that the outage didn't affect the company.    ''Twitter is one of many communication tools we utilize,'' he said. ''Luckily, we love talking to our customers and Twitter going down doesn't impact our phones.'' "
Privacy Issue Complicates Push to Link Medical Data,"President-elect Barack Obama's plan to link up doctors and hospitals with new information technology, as part of an ambitious job-creation program, is imperiled by a bitter, seemingly intractable dispute over how to protect the privacy of electronic medical records.    Lawmakers, caught in a crossfire of lobbying by the health care industry and consumer groups, have been unable to agree on privacy safeguards that would allow patients to control the use of their medical records.    Congressional leaders plan to provide $20 billion for such technology in an economic stimulus bill whose cost could top $825 billion.   In a speech outlining his economic recovery plan, Mr. Obama said, ''We will make the immediate investments necessary to ensure that within five years all of America's medical records are computerized.'' Digital medical records could prevent medical errors, save lives and create hundreds of thousands of jobs, Mr. Obama has said.    So far, the only jobs created have been for a small army of lobbyists trying to secure money for health information technology. They say doctors, hospitals, drugstores and insurance companies would be much more efficient if they could exchange data instantaneously through electronic health information networks. Consumer groups and some members of Congress insist that the new spending must be accompanied by stronger privacy protections in an era when digital data can be sent around the world or posted on the Web with the click of a mouse.    Lawmakers leading the campaign for such safeguards include Representatives Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Pete Stark of California, both Democrats; Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont; and Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine.   Without strong safeguards, Mr. Markey said, the dream of electronic health information networks could turn into ''a nightmare for consumers.''   In the last few years, personal health information on hundreds of thousands of people has been compromised because of security lapses at hospitals, insurance companies and government agencies. These breaches occurred despite federal privacy rules issued under a 1996 law. Congress is trying to strengthen those privacy protections and make sure they apply to computer records. Lobbyists for insurers, drug benefit managers and others in the health industry are mobilizing a campaign to persuade Congress that overly stringent privacy protections would frustrate the potential benefits of digital records.    One of the proposed safeguards would outlaw the sale of any personal health information in an electronic medical record, except with the patient's permission.    Another would allow patients to impose additional controls on certain particularly sensitive information, like records of psychotherapy, abortions and tests for the virus that causes AIDS. Patients could demand that such information be segregated from the rest of their medical records.    Under other proposals being seriously considered in Congress, health care providers and insurers would have to use encryption technology to protect personal health information stored in or sent by computers. Patients would have a right to an accounting of any disclosures of their electronic data. Health care providers and insurers would have to notify patients whenever such information was lost, stolen or used for an unauthorized purpose. And patients -- or state officials acting on their behalf -- could recover damages from an entity that improperly used or disclosed personal health information.    Rahm Emanuel, who will be the White House chief of staff for Mr. Obama, advocated such safeguards when he was a House member from Illinois. ''As we move forward on health information technology,'' Mr. Emanuel said, ''it is absolutely essential that an individual's most personal and vulnerable information is protected.''   Advisers to Mr. Obama say he favors strong privacy protections but does not want the dispute to slow down the bill.   Mary R. Grealy, president of the Health Care Leadership Council, which represents large health care corporations, said the proposed safeguards could be an impediment to the widespread adoption of health information technology and counteract any economic stimulus effect.    In a letter to Congressional leaders, Karen M. Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers, expressed ''serious concern about privacy provisions being considered for inclusion in the economic stimulus bill.''   She criticized, in particular, a proposal that would require health care providers to obtain the consent of patients before disclosing personal health information for treatment, payment or ''health care operations.''   Such a requirement, she said, could cripple efforts to manage chronic diseases like diabetes, which often require coordination of care among many specialists.   At the moment, senior House Democrats are determined to include privacy safeguards in the economic recovery bill. But some insurance lobbyists said they hoped Congress would punt on the issue, leaving privacy standards to be developed by the Health and Human Services Department, where they believe they can make their case more effectively. Microsoft has joined many consumer groups in supporting stronger safeguards. The software giant has developed products that allow consumers and providers to store and share medical data in a secure format.    ''Health information technology will succeed only if privacy is protected,'' said Frank C. Torres, director of consumer affairs at Microsoft. ''For the president-elect to achieve his vision, he has to protect privacy.''   Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Peter R. Orszag, director-designate of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said electronic medical records could be more secure than paper records.   ''If the files are electronic,'' Mr. Whitehouse said, ''computers can record every time someone has access to your medical information.'' But, he said, the challenge is political as well as technical.   ''Until people are more confident about the security of electronic medical records,'' Mr. Whitehouse said, ''it's vitally important that we err on the side of privacy.''   The data in medical records has great potential commercial value. Several companies, for example, buy and sell huge amounts of data on the prescribing habits of doctors, and the information has proved invaluable to pharmaceutical sales representatives.   ''Health I.T. without privacy is an excellent way for companies to establish a gold mine of information that can be used to increase profits, promote expensive drugs, cherry-pick patients who are cheaper to insure and market directly to consumers,'' said Dr. Deborah C. Peel, coordinator of the Coalition for Patient Privacy, which includes the American Civil Liberties Union among its members. "
"Cellphones Largely Immune to Viruses, for Now","E-mail: phonesmart@nytimes.com It has been great using smartphones as de facto computers. You don't have to buy antivirus software or worry about the devices going haywire every time some Ukrainian crime ring finds a new way to steal data from the cloud.   Which is why you could almost hear a sigh of exasperation from the geekier layers of the mobile industry late last month when they heard about hackers finding a way to break into iPhones and remotely control every aspect of the device.   It appears, however, that the worry-free ride will continue, at least in the near future, and not just because Apple quickly circulated a software patch to plug the vulnerability. Rather, for their extended peace of mind, users can credit the more tightly controlled -- some would say strangulated -- structure of the mobile phone industry in the United States. They can also credit some sheer dumb luck.   Such luck is familiar to users of Apple computers. The machines, though loved by those who buy them, have never caught on around the world. That lack of market share was a protection; virus writers can't be bothered writing malicious code for so few targets.    The iPhone is in the same boat. As strange as it may sound in a country where so many people have these devices you would think they were given away in Cracker Jack boxes, iPhones worldwide barely register. Instead, it is Nokia mobile phones, running Symbian software, that reign supreme nearly everywhere except the United States.   So while thousands of law-abiding software developers are diligently building apps to clutter your iPhone or BlackBerry, the black hats taking aim at phones have already found their targets and they don't include North America. At least not yet.   Just ask the people who are notorious for revving up consumers' fears about computer security -- namely, the makers of antivirus software. ''The likelihood of getting hit by mobile malware is almost nonexistent,'' said Mikko H. Hypponen, the chief research officer at F-Secure, which writes software to detect and remove viruses from desktop and mobile devices.   The company, he said, has found and analyzed 490 mobile viruses in the last five years. In that same period, more than two million viruses were made for Windows computers. And those few mobile attacks were noteworthy for the fact that they were so, well, juvenile. They didn't involve hacking for financial or personal data. ''They're done by hobbyists,'' Mr. Hypponen  said. ''Stupid attacks to leave funny displays.''   So even if a few hackers are focused on Nokias, users of such devices are not likely to be deeply affected.   Mr. Hypponen said the worry-free nature of the wireless world could well change, of course, since criminals could richly profit from successful mobile intrusions. If they break into a phone and direct it to make calls to toll lines like 900 numbers, that's big money for the owners of those 900 numbers.   To do that, though, they would have to overcome another advantage mobile devices enjoy over desktop machines -- the wireless carriers and device makers. While PC manufacturers have no control over what people put on their computers, that is generally not true for device makers and wireless carriers.   Most carriers do their own filtering for spam and content that could lead you to download malware before data reaches your phone via text messages. Meanwhile, mobile software shops -- like the Research in Motion App World for BlackBerrys, the Apple App Store, the Nokia Ovi Store and the application stores of the various wireless operators --  test and approve programs before selling them.   Windows Mobile and Android apps are a bit of a murkier story.   Google, whose Android software runs the newest generation of smartphones like the G1 and the new myTouch 3G, both from T-Mobile, said consumers must rely on user feedback to determine whether to trust a software maker. That leaves some risk, since newer apps in Android's ''Market'' will have too little feedback for it to be of real use.   When the Windows Mobile Marketplace -- Microsoft's answer to Apple's App Store -- has its debut this fall, certification protections will be in place, the company said.   Until then, owners of Windows devices would do well to seek out software add-ons from reputable sources like Handmark, Handango or Best Buy. (These outlets also sell applications that have been tested and certified by BlackBerry and Nokia, among others.)   Of course, even walled gardens like Apple's App Store are not always perfect, as the latest iPhone dust-up demonstrated. Apple's critics said the vulnerability would have existed for weeks had hackers not alerted the company before they announced their discovery.   Apple declined to comment, beyond asserting that no owner was victimized by the vulnerability. Which brings up the $24.95 question: will security-anxious consumers gain much by buying antivirus software for their phones?   Of the major wireless carriers, only Verizon Wireless recommends it. Like other wireless companies, though, Verizon suggests some common-sense precautions. For instance, don't respond to e-mail or text messages from strangers. Don't click on links inside messages unless you're certain they're trustworthy.   Likewise, don't lend the phone to someone whose frontal lobe isn't yet developed enough to take these precautions. (And if that rule sounds like it was directed at my children, it was.)   Finally, find your phone's ''software update'' button and use it, because wireless companies will regularly issue updates to snag spammers or hackers, among other things.   Wireless companies are a bit controlling when it comes to so many aspects of the cellphone experience. In this respect, at least, that stranglehold might for once resemble a warm embrace.   Quick Calls   Android phones on T-Mobile have fewer apps available than BlackBerrys and the iPhone, but useful software continues to flow onto the platform. TeleNav last week released its turn-by-turn navigation app for the myTouch 3G, the latest ''Google phone.'' Speak the address you want, and it does the rest ($10 a month, or $100 a year). ... Fantasy football season is about to start, and iPhone apps are warming up for the task. Fantasy Football Cheatsheet '09 ($2) offers player news, depth charts, 2008 statistics and advanced filtering and search. ... Samsung fans have a pair of new phones to choose from. The Solstice, on AT&T ($150 with two-year contract), is a touch-screen device with video and audio streaming and preloaded games. The Reclaim, on Sprint, is aimed at the environmentally conscious texting crowd. Samsung claims that 80 percent of its materials are recyclable. It costs $50 with a two-year contract and a $50 mail-in rebate, and goes on sale Saturday. "
Unreasonable Search,"The Supreme Court has long struggled to balance the privacy rights of students against schools' need to keep campuses safe. On Tuesday, the court hears arguments in a suit brought on behalf of a 13-year-old girl who was strip-searched based on a fellow student's false report that she had possessed    ibuprofen pain-relief pills.     The invasion of privacy was extreme and the security rationale weak. The court should rule, as a lower appellate court did, that the search was unconstitutional.   Savana Redding was an honors student at a middle school in Safford, Ariz., with a clean discipline record. A friend of Savana's, who was found in possession of pain relievers, told school authorities that Savana had given her 400-milligram ibuprofen pills, a prescription-level dose of the pain reliever in over-the-counter Advil and Motrin, used to treat headaches and menstrual cramps.   Based on this information, a male assistant principal had Savana taken out of class and strip-searched by two female employees. Savana was told to pull her bra in a way that exposed her breasts, and to pull out her underwear to expose her pelvic area. Savana, who was too scared to refuse, later called the search ''the most humiliating experience'' in her life. No drugs were found.   Savana's mother sued the school district, charging that her daughter's Fourth Amendment rights had been violated.    The Supreme Court has held that to satisfy the Fourth Amendment, a search of a student by school officials must be reasonable at the start. The search of Savana was not. It was based entirely on the self-serving statement of a student who was trying to deflect blame from herself. The school did not corroborate the tip before acting and the student who gave it did not say that Savana currently had ibuprofen, or that she was hiding it in a place where a strip search would be needed to find it.    The Supreme Court has also said that a search of a student must be reasonable in scope, taking into account the circumstances.    Again, the search of Savana fell short. As the San Francisco-based United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit observed, it is ''common sense'' that telling a 13-year-old girl to disrobe to partially reveal her breasts and pelvis because she might possess ibuprofen -- ''an infraction that poses imminent danger to no one'' -- was unreasonable. The school could, the court pointed out, simply have kept Savana in the principal's office until a parent arrived.   With many communities today worried about keeping drugs and other contraband out of schools, the Supreme Court may be tempted to focus on schools' need to enforce their rules. The court may also be reluctant to hold schools liable for damages for improper searches, given how tight budgets are right now.    These are important concerns, but so -- as the founders made clear in the Fourth Amendment -- is the right of every American to be free from unreasonable searches. The strip-search of Savana was unnecessary, humiliating and clearly unreasonable. "
Text-Message Privacy Case Is Accepted By Justices,"The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether a police department violated the constitutional privacy rights of an employee when it inspected personal text messages sent and received on a government pager.   The case opens ''a new frontier in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,'' according to a three-judge panel of an appeals court that ruled in favor of the employee, a police sergeant on the Ontario, Calif., SWAT team.    Orin S. Kerr, an authority on the Fourth Amendment at George Washington University's law school, said the case was simultaneously significant and idiosyncratic. ''This is the first case on Fourth Amendment protection in data networks,'' Mr. Kerr  said. But the case arose from unusual circumstances, making it fairly likely that the eventual Supreme Court ruling will be  narrow.    The Supreme Court has given public employers wide latitude to search their employees' offices and files. But it  has also said that the Fourth Amendment, which forbids unreasonable government searches, has a role to play in any analysis of that latitude.    The Ontario Police Department had a formal policy reserving the right to monitor ''network activity including e-mail and Internet use,'' allowing ''light personal communications'' by employees but cautioning that they ''should have no expectation of privacy.'' It did not directly address text messages.   Members of the department's SWAT team were given pagers and told they were responsible for charges in excess of 25,000 characters a month. Under an informal policy adopted by a police lieutenant, those who paid the excess charges themselves would not have their messages inspected.   The lieutenant eventually changed his mind and ordered transcripts of messages sent and received by Sgt. Jeff Quon. In one month in 2002, only 57 of more than 450 of those messages were related to official business. According to the trial judge, many of the messages ''were, to say the least, sexually explicit in nature.''    Sergeant Quon and some of the people with whom he messaged sued, saying their Fourth Amendment rights had been violated. Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw, writing for a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, said the department's formal policy had been overridden by the ''operational reality'' of the lieutenant's informal policy.   Dissenting from the full Ninth Circuit's decision not to rehear the case, Judge Sandra S. Ikuta said the panel had violated ''the dictates of reason and common sense'' and had hobbled ''government employers from managing their work forces.''    The City of Ontario and its police department, in asking the Supreme Court to hear the case, said ''a lower-level supervisor's informal arrangement'' should not be allowed to trump ''the employer's explicit no-privacy policy.''   ''It is not objectively reasonable to expect privacy in a message sent to someone else's workplace pager,'' the brief said, ''let alone to a police officer's department-issued pager.''    The Supreme Court's decision, the brief went on, will affect ''a seemingly never-ending stream of new technologies.''   Though the legal issue in the case, City of Ontario v. Quon, No. 08-1332, concerns only text messaging in government workplaces, the Supreme Court's decision may provide  hints about its attitude toward privacy in the Internet era more generally.   The larger question, Judge Stephen G. Larson of the Federal District Court in Riverside, Calif., wrote in declining to dismiss Sergeant Quon's case before trial, is this: ''What are the legal boundaries of an employee's privacy in this interconnected, electronic-communication age, one in which thoughts and ideas that would have been spoken personally and privately in ages past are now instantly text-messaged to friend and family via hand-held, computer-assisted electronic devices?''  "
Cellphone Searches,"The Ohio Supreme Court has struck an important blow for privacy rights, ruling that the police need a warrant to search a cellphone. The court rightly recognized that cellphones today are a lot more than just telephones, that they hold a wealth of personal information and that the privacy interest in them is considerable. This was the first such ruling from a state supreme court. It is a model for other courts to follow.    Searches generally require warrants, but courts have carved out limited categories in which they are not needed. One of these is that police officers are allowed, when they arrest people, to search them and the area immediately surrounding them, as well as some kinds of containers in their possession.   When the police arrested Antwaun Smith on drug charges they seized his cellphone and searched it, examining his call records. The police did not have a warrant or the consent of Mr. Smith.   The Ohio Supreme Court ruled this month, by a 4-to-3 vote, that the search violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Rather than seeing a cellphone as a simple closed container, the majority noted that modern cellphones -- especially ones that permit Internet access -- are ''capable of storing a wealth of digitized information.''    This is information, the court said, for which people reasonably have a high expectation of privacy, and under established Fourth Amendment principles, police officers must get a search warrant before they can look through call logs or examine other data. The court wisely decided that it made no sense to try to distinguish among various kinds of cellphones based on what specific functions they have. All cellphones, the court said, fall under the search warrant requirement.    Few federal courts have considered the issue of cellphone searches, and they have disagreed about whether a warrant should be required. The Ohio ruling eloquently makes the case for why the very personal information that new forms of technology aggregate must be accorded a significant degree of privacy. "
Researchers Create a Mini-Internet to Stalk Botnets,"Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif., are creating what is in effect a vast digital petri dish able to hold one million operating systems at once in an effort to study the behavior of rogue programs known as botnets.   Botnets are  used extensively by malicious computer hackers to steal computing power  from Internet-connected computers. The hackers harness the stolen resources into a scattered but powerful computer that can be used to  send spam, execute phishing scams or  steal digital information. These remote-controlled ''distributed computers''  are difficult to observe and track.    Botnets may take over parts of tens of thousands or in some cases even millions of computers, making them among the world's most powerful computers for some applications.    ''When a forest is on fire you can fly over it, but with a cyberattack you have no clear idea of what it looks like,'' said Ron Minnich, a Sandia scientist who specializes in computer security. ''It's an extremely difficult task to get a global picture.''   To stalk the botnets, Mr. Minnich and his colleague Don Rudish have converted a Dell supercomputer to simulate a mini-Internet of one million computers.    The researchers said they hoped to be able to infect their digital petri dish with a botnet in October and then gather data on how the system behaves. One of the challenges will be in tricking the botnet components into believing they are running in the open Internet.    Some botnet makers have designed their programs to detect so-called honey pots,  programs that pretend to be computers that can be taken over but which instead are used to capture and observe botnet clients.   Typically, supercomputers have been designed with the goal of reaching absolute computing performance, and used for complex scientific or engineering tasks like modeling the earth's climate, protein folding or simulating nuclear weapons explosions.    The Sandia computer, which the researchers have named MegaTux, in a reference to Tux, the penguin character that is the official mascot of the Linux operating system, is an example of a new kind of computational science, in which computers are used to simulate scientific instruments that were once used in physical world laboratories. For example, Microsoft researchers have created a vast visualization database they call the world wide telescope.   ''One of the advantages of such a system is that we can stop the simulation at any point and look for patterns,'' Mr. Rudish said. ''It's one of the neat things you can do when you crash a simulation of a 747 on a supercomputer.''   In the past, the researchers said, no one has tried to program a computer to simulate more than tens of thousands of operating systems.    The Dell Thunderbird supercomputer used for the Sandia project has  4,480 Intel microprocessors, far fewer than the million operating systems the researchers sought to simulate. But they used  ''virtual machine''  software technology to get each microprocessor to simultaneously run many instances of a Linux-based component called a kernel -- a basic component of an operating system that manages communications between software and hardware.   Because most botnets are written for the Windows operating system, the researchers are planning to use an open source program called Wine, making it possible to run Windows-based programs without actually having the complete Windows operating system. They said they were not using Windows itself because of the licensing costs of purchasing one million copies of Windows.    Besides simulating the Internet, Keith Vanderveen, manager of scaleable computing research at Sandia, said the system would be valuable for exploring the design of future supercomputers that might have millions rather than thousands of processors. It will also be invaluable for researchers who are hoping to design new, more secure protocols for the Internet.      ''We will have a test bed where we will be able to try things out at Internet scale,'' he said.   The researchers said they were collaborating with military contractors who are developing the National Cyber Range, a project financed by the Pentagon  that is intended to be a testing ground for defensive techniques and new weapons developed for cyberwar.

New Version of Malicious Computer Program Is Released,"The author or authors of a malicious software program that has infected more than 12 million computers since it was released last fall have begun distributing a new version of the program after computer security teams crippled the original's ability to do damage.    The new version, known as Conficker B++, was spotted by security researchers at SRI International, who reported last week that the software was an effort by cybercriminals to find a new way to communicate with their programs after they had succeeded in infecting target computers.   The Conficker code is intended to create compromised computers that work together in a network known as a botnet. The first two versions of the program contained a complex mechanism designed to permit the downloading of attack code that could presumably do anything from stealing passwords to sending spam e-mail messages to the millions of infected computers.    However, in a cat-and-mouse game over the past month, computer security groups reverse-engineered the botnet software and uncovered the method it would have used to direct infected machines to new Internet addresses, where they could obtain software instructions. The security groups then froze the addresses before they could be used.   Now, Conficker's creators have begun distributing the new version of the program. It does not, however, update already infected computers, meaning that the process of spreading the program must be repeated.   On Feb. 13, Microsoft and a group of partners offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the creators of the Conficker program. The software, which exploits several weaknesses in Microsoft's Windows operating system, has spread more aggressively than any other malware released in the last five years.  "
Your Financial Data: How Safe Is It?,"SELDOM is so much private financial information packaged so neatly as when you apply for a mortgage. Yet a recent survey suggests that not all lenders may be handling that material as carefully as they should.    The survey, conducted late last year by Wolters Kluwer Financial Services of Minneapolis, asked executives from roughly 350 banks, credit unions and mortgage companies how they transmitted financial data. About 62 percent used the Internet, but nearly two-thirds of that group said that they typically used traditional e-mail services rather than secure online delivery technologies, like e-mail  stored at a password-protected Web site.     Art Tyszka, the director of document services at Wolters Kluwer, which sells secure document delivery software to financial institutions, said that the traditional transmission methods could leave borrowers at heightened risk for identity theft and other forms of financial fraud.     ''Any good 14-year-old hacker can intercept e-mail,'' he said. ''It's very risky.''   E-mail messages typically travel over a network of Internet servers, Mr. Tyszka explained, and hackers can prey on the most poorly protected of those servers, scanning messages for Social Security numbers, loan terms or other commonly used mortgage information.    The more secure systems, he said, send the information in an encrypted form or direct a recipient to a Web site where information can be accessed only with a password.    But even these secure methods are not completely foolproof.    ''It can be difficult to control a staff of tens of thousands,'' Mr. Tyszka said, ''so some communications can squeak outside the normal secure channels.''   Larger banks usually use the more secure e-mail method, he said, while smaller community banks or credit unions may not want to pay for encryption systems. Many of them, though, will send loan documents through conventional mail or other services like U.P.S. or FedEx.   The bigger problems, Mr. Tyszka said, come with smaller mortgage brokers who may communicate with borrowers via e-mail messages.    ''Frankly, they may not know any better,'' he said, adding that unlike banks, brokers are not  audited by federal regulators, so such practices may be more likely to go unnoticed.   But George Hanzimanolis, the immediate past president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, argued that ''consumers are actually safer using a broker than a big bank -- with banks, hackers know exactly where to go.''    He added that many smaller brokers use ''loan origination systems'' that help them transmit documents securely.   Still, the president of a mortgage brokerage firm in the greater New York City area, who spoke on the condition of anonymity rather than disclose details about the data handling procedures of business partners, was not surprised by the findings in the Wolters Kluwer survey.   The brokerage president, who has also served in board positions for state and national mortgage broker trade groups, said the mortgage industry's troubles were partly to blame. ''In their desperation,'' the president said, ''people may not be thinking about this stuff.''    This executive provided a recent example: a well-established mortgage broker recently decided to shut down, but he wanted to find another broker to honor his loan commitments.   He had no secure e-mail system to transmit 40 loan applications, so began sending them via e-mail to the brokerage president. After two files had arrived, the brokerage president alerted the sender to possible privacy implications.    A similar problem, the mortgage company president said, involves the whereabouts of mortgage applications when a business shuts down.    ''How many companies are closing down,'' the executive asked, ''and how many loan originators are walking around with boxes of loan files in their cars, in their houses, on their laptops? Where did your file end up? In somebody's family room?'' "
Time to Be Afraid of the Web?,"Internet users used to comfort themselves by thinking that to become victims of the pirates of the Web, they had to frequent the online porn circuit or respond to an e-mail from the widowed wife of the former central bank governor of Nigeria. The idea was that one had to do something naughty to get caught in the wrongdoers' net, or at least go for a late-night stroll in the rough end of town.     But the conceit has become untenable. Two years ago, engineers at Google reported that about 10 percent of millions of Web pages they analyzed engaged in ''drive-by downloads'' of malware. Google today has about 330,000 Web sites listed as malicious, up from about 150,000 a year ago.    Earlier this month, the Justice Department charged a 28-year-old from Miami and a couple of Russians with stealing 130 million credit card numbers from one of the largest payment processing companies in the world, which should know how to protect its computers from hackers. And last week, McAfee, the maker of antivirus software, reported that fans searching for Hollywood gossip and memorabilia faced a high risk of getting caught up by online bad guys.    Searching for the actress Jessica Biel, who won an achievement award at the Newport Beach Film Festival in 2006 and ranked in third place on Maxim magazine's Hot 100 list last year, is most dangerous, with a 1 in 5 chance of landing at a Web site that tested positive for spyware, adware, spam, phishing, viruses or other noxious stuff. Searches of Beyonce, Britney Spears and even Tom Brady of the New England Patriots are risky, too, according to McAfee. More than 40 percent of Google search results for ''Jennifer Aniston screen savers'' contained viruses, including one called FunLove.    Perhaps cybercops will respond more aggressively to Internet threats as they spread to the more wholesome parts of the Web, like police forces that leave crime alone in the poor parts of town but snap into action when it seeps into middle-class neighborhoods. McAfee, to no one's surprise, suggests that we buy McAfee software.   But with more and more information about people's credit cards, browsing histories and identities sloshing around online, I wonder whether this will do. A few months ago, I nervously created my first Facebook page with the minimum necessary information to view pictures posted by old friends.   I returned to the page a few days later to discover that somehow it had found out both the name of my college and my graduation class, displaying them under my name. I have not returned since. In the back of my mind, I fear a 28-year-old hacker and a couple of Russians have gathered two more facts about me that I would rather they didn't have. And it's way too late to take my life offline.   "
Computer Experts Unite to Hunt Worm,"An extraordinary behind-the-scenes struggle is taking place between computer security groups around the world and the brazen author of a malicious software program called Conficker.   The program grabbed global attention when it began spreading late last year and quickly infected millions of computers with software code that is intended  to lash together the infected machines it controls into a powerful computer known as a botnet.    Since then, the program's author has repeatedly updated its software in a cat-and-mouse game being fought with an informal international alliance of computer security firms and a network governance group known as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Members refer to the alliance as the Conficker Cabal.    The existence of the botnet has brought together some of the world's best computer security experts to prevent potential damage. The spread of the malicious software is on a scale that matches the worst of past viruses and worms, like the I Love You virus. Last month, Microsoft announced a $250,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the Conficker author.   Botnets are used to send the vast majority of e-mail spam messages. Spam in turn is the basis for shady commercial promotions including  schemes that frequently involve directing unwary users to Web sites that can plant malicious software, or malware, on computers.    Botnets can also be used to distribute other kinds of malware and generate attacks that can take commercial or government Web sites off-line.    One of the largest botnets tracked last year consisted of 1.5 million infected computers that were being used to automate the breaking of ''captchas,'' the squiggly letter tests that are used to force applicants for Web services to prove they are human.   The inability of the world's best computer security technologists to gain the upper hand against anonymous but determined cybercriminals is viewed by a growing number of those involved in the fight as evidence of a fundamental security weakness in the global network.    ''I walked up to a three-star general on Wednesday and asked him if he could help me deal with a million-node botnet,'' said Rick Wesson, a computer security researcher involved in combating Conficker. ''I didn't get an answer.''   An examination of the program reveals that the zombie computers are programmed to try to contact a control system for instructions on April 1. There has been a range of speculation about the nature of the threat posed by the botnet, from a wake-up call to a devastating attack.   Researchers who have been painstakingly disassembling the Conficker code have not been able to determine where the author, or authors, is located, or whether the program is being maintained by one person or a group of hackers. The growing suspicion is that Conficker will ultimately be a computing-for-hire scheme. Researchers expect it will imitate the hottest fad in the computer industry, called cloud computing, in which companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems sell computing as a service over the Internet.   Earlier botnets were devised so they could be split up and rented via black market schemes that are common in the Internet underground, according to security researchers.   The Conficker program is built so that after it takes up residence on infected computers, it can be programmed remotely by software to serve as a vast system for distributing spam or other malware.    Several people who have analyzed various versions of the program said Conficker's authors were obviously monitoring the efforts to restrict the malicious program and had repeatedly demonstrated that their skills were at the leading edge of computer technology.    For example, the Conficker worm already had been through several versions when the alliance of computer security experts seized control of 250 Internet domain names the system was planning to use to forward instructions to millions of infected computers.   Shortly thereafter, in the first week of March, the fourth known version of the program, Conficker C, expanded the number of the sites it could use to 50,000. That step made it virtually impossible to stop the Conficker authors from communicating with their botnet.   ''It's worth noting that these are folks who are taking this seriously and not making many mistakes,'' said Jose Nazario, a member of the international security group and a researcher at Arbor Networks, a company in Lexington, Mass., that provides tools for monitoring the performance of networks. ''They're going for broke.''   Several members of the Conficker Cabal said that law enforcement officials had been slow to respond to the group's efforts, but that a number of law enforcement agencies were now in ''listen'' mode.   ''We're aware of it,'' said Paul Bresson, an F.B.I. spokesman, ''and we're working with security companies to address the problem.''    A report scheduled to be released Thursday by SRI International, a nonprofit research institute in Menlo Park, Calif., says that Conficker C constitutes a major rewrite of the software. Not only does it make it far more difficult to block communication with the program, but it gives the program added powers to disable many commercial antivirus programs as well as Microsoft's security update features.   ''Perhaps the most obvious frightening aspect of Conficker C is its clear potential to do harm,'' said Phillip Porras, a research director at SRI International and one of the authors of the report. ''Perhaps in the best case, Conficker may be used as a sustained and profitable platform for massive Internet fraud and theft.''   ''In the worst case,'' Mr. Porras said, ''Conficker could be turned into a powerful offensive weapon for performing concerted information warfare attacks that could disrupt not just countries, but the Internet itself.''   The researchers, noting that the Conficker authors were using the most advanced computer security techniques, said the original version of the program contained a recent security feature developed by an M.I.T. computer scientist, Ron Rivest, that had been made public only weeks before. And when a revision was issued by Dr. Rivest's group to correct a flaw, the Conficker authors revised their program to add the correction.    Although there have been clues that the Conficker authors may be located in Eastern Europe, evidence has not been conclusive. Security researchers, however, said this week that they were impressed by the authors' productivity.    ''If you suspect this person lives in Kiev,'' Mr. Nazario said, ''I would look for someone who has recently reported repetitive stress injury symptoms.'' "
Web's Anonymity Makes Cyberattack Hard to Trace,"It is an axiom that ''on the Internet nobody knows that you are a dog.''    By the same token, it is all but impossible to know whether you are from North Korea or South Korea.    That puzzle is plaguing law enforcement investigators in several nations who are now hunting for the authors of a small but highly publicized Internet denial-of-service attack that briefly knocked offline the Web sites of some United States and South Korean government agencies and companies.   The attack, which began over the Fourth of July weekend and continued into the next week, led to South Korean accusations that the attack had been conducted by North Korean military or intelligence agents, possibly in retaliation for new United Nations sanctions. American officials quickly cautioned that despite sensational news media coverage, the attacks were no different from similar challenges government agencies face on a daily basis.    Cyberwarfare specialists cautioned this week that the Internet was effectively a ''wilderness of mirrors,'' and that attributing the source of cyberattacks and other kinds of exploitation is difficult at best and sometimes impossible. Despite the initial assertions and rumors that North Korea was behind the attacks and slight evidence that the programmer had some familiarity with South Korean software, the consensus of most computer security specialists is that the attackers could be located anywhere in the world.   ''It would be incredibly difficult to prove that North Korea was involved in this,'' said Amrit Williams, chief technology officer for Bigfix, a computer security management firm. ''There are no geographic borders for the Internet. I can reach out and touch people everywhere.''   But researchers said that law enforcement investigators were likely to be aided in their pursuit by a second computer security truism -- that the only ones who get caught are dumb, unsophisticated or both.    For starters, the attacking system, which cannibalized more than 50,000 computers and which is known as a botnet, was actually small, computer researchers said, compared with similar computer malware programs that are now routinely used by members of the computer underground.   Moreover, independent researchers, who have examined the programmer's instructions used to lash together the tens of thousands of computers, said that it showed that the program, known as a D.D.O.S., or a distributed denial of service attack, revealed a high degree of amateurism.   That fact suggested that the authors, who hid themselves by masking their actions behind an international trail of Internet-connected computers, might have left telltale fingerprints that will ultimately be their undoing.   Last week, investigators quickly located computers that were involved with the control of the botnet in Britain and several other countries. However, the Internet service provider whose systems were implicated in the attack quickly issued a news release stating that the attack was actually coming from Miami. The company said that it was cooperating with the Serious Organized Crime Agency, a law enforcement agency that is part of the British government.   But independent investigators who have tracked the botnet cautioned against placing reliance on the locations for the command-and-control computers that have been publicly identified.   ''We're still looking for the initial infection vector,'' said Jose Nazario, a network security researcher at Arbor Networks, a computer security provider for large network systems.   Several researchers recalled a similar incident in 2000, when a series of high-profile denial of service attacks were conducted against companies including Yahoo!, Amazon.com, Dell, ETrade, eBay and CNN. The culprit proved to be a 15-year-old Canadian high school student who was identified as a suspect only after publicly bragging about the attacks in an online forum.   Finding attackers who have no desire to reveal their locations -- even amateurs -- may be far more vexing.   ''The truth is, we may never know the true origin of the attack unless the attacker made some colossal blunder,'' said Joe Stewart, a director in the Counter Threat Unit at SecureWorks, a computer security consulting organization.   Some experts pointed to an entirely different origin for the attacks, or at least the attention paid to them. Cyberwarfare has become a hot topic in Washington this year, with the Obama administration undertaking a detailed review of the nation's computer security preparedness.   ''There is a U.S. political debate going on right now with high stakes and big payoffs,'' said Ronald J. Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto. ''With the administration cyberreview there are many government agencies orbiting around the policy debate that have an interest in pointing to this incident as evidence with obvious implications.'' "
U.S. Plans Attack and Defense in Web Warfare,"This article was reported by David E. Sanger, John Markoff and Thom Shanker and written by Mr. Sanger. When American forces in Iraq wanted to lure members of Al Qaeda into a trap, they hacked into one of the group's computers and altered information that drove them into American gun sights. When President George W. Bush ordered new ways to slow Iran's progress toward a nuclear bomb last year, he approved a plan for an experimental covert program -- its results still unclear -- to bore into their computers and undermine the project. And the Pentagon has commissioned military contractors to develop a highly classified replica of the Internet of the future. The goal is to simulate what it would take for adversaries to shut down the country's power stations, telecommunications and aviation systems, or freeze the financial markets -- in an effort to build better defenses against such attacks, as well as a new generation of online weapons.  Just as the invention of the atomic bomb changed warfare and deterrence 64 years ago, a new international race has begun to develop cyberweapons and systems to protect against them. Thousands of daily attacks on federal and private computer systems in the United States -- many from China and Russia, some malicious and some testing chinks in the patchwork of American firewalls -- have prompted the Obama administration to review American strategy. President Obama is expected to propose a far larger defensive effort in coming days, including an expansion of the $17 billion, five-year program that Congress approved last year, the appointment of a White House official to coordinate the effort, and an end to a running bureaucratic battle over who is responsible for defending against cyberattacks. But Mr. Obama is expected to say little or nothing about the nation's offensive capabilities, on which the military and the nation's intelligence agencies have been spending billions. In interviews over the past several months, a range of military and intelligence officials, as well as outside experts, have described a huge increase in the sophistication of American cyberwarfare capabilities. Because so many aspects of the American effort to develop cyberweapons and define their proper use remain classified, many of those officials declined to speak on the record. The White House declined several requests for interviews or to say whether Mr. Obama as a matter of policy supports or opposes the use of American cyberweapons. The most exotic innovations under consideration would enable a Pentagon programmer to surreptitiously enter a computer server in Russia or China, for example, and destroy a ''botnet'' -- a potentially destructive program that commandeers infected machines into a vast network that can be clandestinely controlled -- before it could be unleashed in the United States. Or American intelligence agencies could activate malicious code that is secretly embedded on computer chips when they are manufactured, enabling the United States to take command of an enemy's computers by remote control over the Internet. That, of course, is exactly the kind of attack officials fear could be launched on American targets, often through Chinese-made chips or computer servers. So far, however, there are no broad authorizations for American forces to engage in cyberwar. The invasion of the Qaeda computer in Iraq several years ago and the covert activity in Iran were each individually authorized by Mr. Bush. When he issued a set of classified presidential orders in January 2008 to organize and improve America's online defenses, the administration could not agree on how to write the authorization. A principal architect of that order said the issue had been passed on to the next president, in part because of the complexities of cyberwar operations that, by necessity, would most likely be conducted on both domestic and foreign Internet sites. After the controversy surrounding domestic spying, Mr. Bush's aides concluded, the Bush White House did not have the credibility or the political capital to deal with the subject. Electronic Vulnerabilities Cyberwar would not be as lethal as atomic war, of course, nor as visibly dramatic. But when Mike McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, briefed Mr. Bush on the threat in May 2007, he argued that if a single large American bank were successfully attacked ''it would have an order-of-magnitude greater impact on the global economy'' than the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Mr. McConnell, who left office three months ago, warned last year that ''the ability to threaten the U.S. money supply is the equivalent of today's nuclear weapon.'' The scenarios developed last year for the incoming president by Mr. McConnell and his coordinator for cybersecurity, Melissa Hathaway, went further. They described vulnerabilities including an attack on Wall Street and one intended to bring down the nation's electric power grid. Most were extrapolations of attacks already tried. Today, Ms. Hathaway is the primary author of White House cyberstrategy and has been traveling the country talking in vague terms about recent, increasingly bold attacks on the computer networks that keep the country running. Government officials will not discuss the details of a recent attack on the air transportation network, other than to say the attack never directly affected air traffic control systems. Still, the specter of an attack that could blind air traffic controllers and, perhaps, the military's aerospace defense networks haunts military and intelligence officials. (The saving grace of the air traffic control system, officials say, is that it is so old that it is not directly connected to the Internet.) Studies, with code names like Dark Angel, have focused on whether cellphone towers, emergency-service communications and hospital systems could be brought down, to sow chaos. But the theoretical has, at times, become real. ''We have seen Chinese network operations inside certain of our electricity grids,'' said Joel F. Brenner, who oversees counterintelligence operations for Dennis Blair, Mr. McConnell's successor as national intelligence director, speaking at the University of Texas at Austin this month. ''Do I worry about those grids, and about air traffic control systems, water supply systems, and so on? You bet I do.'' But the broader question -- one the administration so far declines to discuss -- is whether the best defense against cyberattack is the development of a robust capability to wage cyberwar. As Mr. Obama's team quickly discovered, the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies both concluded in Mr. Bush's last years in office that it would not be enough to simply build higher firewalls and better virus detectors or to restrict access to the federal government's own computers. ''The fortress model simply will not work for cyber,'' said one senior military officer who has been deeply engaged in the debate for several years. ''Someone will always get in.'' That thinking has led to a debate over whether lessons learned in the nuclear age -- from the days of ''mutually assured destruction'' -- apply to cyberwar. But in cyberwar, it is hard to know where to strike back, or even who the attacker might be. Others have argued for borrowing a page from Mr. Bush's pre-emption doctrine by going into foreign computers to destroy malicious software before it is unleashed into the world's digital bloodstream. But that could amount to an act of war, and many argue it is a losing game, because the United States is more dependent on a constantly running Internet system than many of its potential adversaries, and therefore could suffer more damage in a counterattack. In a report scheduled to be released Wednesday, the National Research Council will argue that although an offensive cybercapability is an important asset for the United States, the nation is lacking a clear strategy, and secrecy surrounding preparations has hindered national debate, according to several people familiar with the report. The advent of Internet attacks -- especially those suspected of being directed by nations, not hackers -- has given rise to a new term inside the Pentagon and the National Security Agency: ''hybrid warfare.'' It describes a conflict in which attacks through the Internet can be launched as a warning shot -- or to pave the way for a traditional attack. Early hints of this new kind of warfare emerged in the confrontation between Russia and Estonia in April 2007. Clandestine groups -- it was never determined if they had links to the Russian government -- commandeered computers around the globe and directed a fire hose of data at Estonia's banking system and its government Web sites. The computer screens of Estonians trying to do business with the government online were frozen, if they got anything at all. It was annoying, but by the standards of cyberwar, it was child's play. In August 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia, the cyberattacks grew more widespread. Georgians were denied online access to news, cash and air tickets. The Georgian government had to move its Internet activity to servers in Ukraine when its own servers locked up, but the attacks did no permanent damage. Every few months, it seems, some agency, research group or military contractor runs a war game to assess the United States' vulnerability. Senior intelligence officials were shocked to discover how easy it was to permanently disable a large power generator. That prompted further studies to determine if attackers could take down a series of generators, bringing whole parts of the country to a halt. Another war game that the Department of Homeland Security sponsored in March 2008, called Cyber Storm II, envisioned a far larger, coordinated attack against the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It studied a disruption of chemical plants, rail lines, oil and gas pipelines and private computer networks. That study and others like it concluded that when attacks go global, the potential economic repercussions increase exponentially. To prove the point, Mr. McConnell, then the director of national intelligence, spent much of last summer urging senior government officials to examine the Treasury Department's scramble to contain the effects of the collapse of Bear Stearns. Markets froze, he said, because ''what backs up that money is confidence -- an accounting system that is reconcilable.'' He began studies of what would happen if the system that clears market trades froze. ''We were halfway through the study,'' one senior intelligence official said last month, ''and the markets froze of their own accord. And we looked at each other and said, 'Our market collapse has just given every cyberwarrior out there a playbook.' '' Just before Mr. Obama was elected, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy research group in Washington, warned in a report that ''America's failure to protect cyberspace is one of the most urgent national security problems facing the new administration.'' What alarmed the panel was not the capabilities of individual hackers but of nations -- China and Russia among them -- that experts believe are putting huge resources into the development of cyberweapons. A research company called Team Cymru recently examined ''scans'' that came across the Internet seeking ways to get inside industrial control systems, and discovered more than 90 percent of them came from computers in China. Scanning alone does no damage, but it could be the prelude to an attack that scrambles databases or seeks to control computers. But Team Cymru ran into a brick wall as soon as it tried to trace who, exactly, was probing these industrial systems. It could not determine whether military organizations, intelligence agencies, terrorist groups, criminals or inventive teenagers were behind the efforts. The good news, some government officials argue, is that the Chinese are deterred from doing real damage: Because they hold more than a trillion dollars in United States government debt, they have little interest in freezing up a system they depend on for their own investments. Then again, some of the scans seemed to originate from 14 other countries, including Taiwan, Russia and, of course, the United States. Bikini Atoll for an Online Age Because ''cyberwar'' contains the word ''war,'' the Pentagon has argued that it should be the locus of American defensive and offensive strategy -- and it is creating the kind of infrastructure that was built around nuclear weapons in the 1940s and '50s. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates is considering proposals to create a Cyber Command -- initially as a new headquarters within the Strategic Command, which controls the American nuclear arsenal and assets in space. Right now, the responsibility for computer network security is part of Strategic Command, and military officials there estimate that over the past six months, the government has spent $100 million responding to probes and attacks on military systems. Air Force officials confirm that a large network of computers at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama was temporarily taken off-line within the past eight months when it was put at risk of widespread infection from computer viruses. But Mr. Gates has concluded that the military's cyberwarfare effort requires a sharper focus -- and thus a specific command. It would build the defenses for military computers and communications systems and -- the part the Pentagon is reluctant to discuss -- develop and deploy cyberweapons. In fact, that effort is already under way -- it is part of what the National Cyber Range is all about. The range is a replica of the Internet of the future, and it is being built to be attacked. Competing teams of contractors -- including BAE Systems, the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University and Sparta Inc. -- are vying to build the Pentagon a system it can use to simulate attacks. The National Security Agency already has a smaller version of a similar system, in Millersville, Md. In short, the Cyber Range is to the digital age what the Bikini Atoll -- the islands the Army vaporized in the 1950s to measure the power of the hydrogen bomb -- was to the nuclear age. But once the tests at Bikini Atoll demonstrated to the world the awesome destructive power of the bomb, it became evident to the United States and the Soviet Union -- and other nuclear powers -- that the risks of a nuclear exchange were simply too high. In the case of cyberattacks, where the results can vary from the annoying to the devastating, there are no such rules. The Deterrence Conundrum During the cold war, if a strategic missile had been fired at the United States, screens deep in a mountain in Colorado would have lighted up and American commanders would have some time to decide whether to launch a counterattack. Today, when Pentagon computers are subjected to a barrage, the origin is often a mystery. Absent certainty about the source, it is almost impossible to mount a counterattack. In the rare case where the preparations for an attack are detected in a foreign computer system, there is continuing debate about whether to embrace the concept of pre-emption, with all of its Bush-era connotations. The questions range from whether an online attack should be mounted on that system to, in an extreme case, blowing those computers up. Some officials argue that if the United States engaged in such pre-emption -- and demonstrated that it was watching the development of hostile cyberweapons -- it could begin to deter some attacks. Others believe it will only justify pre-emptive attacks on the United States. ''Russia and China have lots of nationalistic hackers,'' one senior military officer said. ''They seem very, very willing to take action on their own.'' Senior Pentagon and military officials also express deep concern that the laws and understanding of armed conflict have not kept current with the challenges of offensive cyberwarfare. Over the decades, a number of limits on action have been accepted -- if not always practiced. One is the prohibition against assassinating government leaders. Another is avoiding attacks aimed at civilians. Yet in the cyberworld, where the most vulnerable targets are civilian, there are no such rules or understandings. If a military base is attacked, would it be a proportional, legitimate response to bring down the attacker's power grid if that would also shut down its hospital systems, its air traffic control system or its banking system? ''We don't have that for cyber yet,'' one senior Defense Department official said, ''and that's a little bit dangerous.''

Your E-Health Records,"As part of the stimulus package, $20 billion will be pumped into the health care system to accelerate the use of electronic health records. The goal is both to improve the quality and lower the costs of care by replacing cumbersome paper records with electronic records that can be easily stored and swiftly transmitted.     The idea is sound, but it also raises important questions about how to ensure the privacy of patients. Fortunately, the legislation would impose sensible privacy protections despite attempts by business lobbyists to weaken the safeguards.    With paper records the opportunities for breaches are limited to over-the-shoulder glimpses or the occasional lost or stolen files. But when records are kept and transferred electronically, the potential for abuse can become as vast as the Internet.    Electronic health records that can be linked to individual patients are already protected by laws that apply primarily to hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, pharmacists, laboratories and insurance plans. The stimulus bill that has passed in the House, and a similar bill awaiting approval in the Senate, would strengthen the privacy requirements and apply them more directly to ''business associates'' of the providers, like billing and collection services or pharmacy benefit managers, that have access to sensitive data but are not readily held accountable for any misuse.    The potential for harm was spelled out by the American Civil Liberties Union in a recent letter to Congress. Employers who obtain medical records inappropriately might reject a job candidate who looks expensive to insure. Drug companies with access to pharmaceutical records might try to pressure patients to switch to their products. Data brokers might buy medical and pharmaceutical records and sell them to marketers. Unscrupulous employees with access to electronic records might snoop on the health of their colleagues or neighbors.   The bills pending in Congress would go a long way toward preventing such abuses. They would outlaw the sale of any personal health information without the patient's permission, mandate audit trails to help detect inappropriate access, and require that patients be notified whenever their records are lost or used for an unauthorized purpose. They would also beef up the penalties for noncompliance and allow state attorneys general to help enforce the rules -- a useful backup in case the federal government falls down on the job. The House version would also encourage the use of protective technologies, like encryption, to protect personal medical information that will be transmitted.    Health insurance plans and some disease management groups are complaining that the new requirements would impose administrative burdens that could actually impede the use of electronic records and interfere with coordination of care. They want to ease the marketing restrictions, notify patients only if security breaches are harmful, and keep the attorneys general out of the enforcement role.    It should be possible through implementing regulations to fine-tune the privacy requirements so that they do not disrupt patient care. Congress must make every effort to ensure that patients' privacy is protected. "
Agency Skeptical of Internet Privacy Policies,"The Federal Trade Commission had some sharp words for Internet companies Thursday, saying that they are not explaining to their users clearly enough what information they collect about them and how they use it for advertising.     For now, the commission is sticking to its view that the Internet industry can voluntarily regulate its own privacy practices.    But the tone of the report, and comments by several commission members and staff officials, indicated that if the industry does not move faster, the agency would increase regulation or call for Congress to legislate stricter online privacy rules.   ''People were worried that the commission would abandon its support for self-regulation,'' said Jules Polonetsky, the co-chairman of the Future of Privacy Forum, a trade group. ''The commission is saying you have one last chance before I come upstairs and take your toys away.''   Technically, the commission released an update to its principles for what it calls online behavioral advertising -- ads shown to the user based on past patterns of behavior. These are voluntary guidelines first issued at the end of 2007.    The new guidelines suggest that Web sites explain how they collect and use data in a ''clear, concise, consumer friendly, and prominent'' way. Few sites meet that standard right now, the commission found.    ''What we observe is that, with rare exception, it is not the rule for any Web sites to do those things,'' said Eileen Harrington, the acting director of the commission's bureau of consumer protection, in an interview Thursday. ''It is far more commonplace for them to  put the information in the midst of lengthy and hard-to-understand privacy policies.''   Ms. Harrington challenged Internet companies to explain what they are doing in a section other than its privacy policy.   The commission did not specify what sort of notice companies should give, but it noted that some have proposed methods that are more visible to the average user, like a link right on each advertisement that leads to an explanation of what data the advertiser collects and uses.   ''This is about advertising, so these people ought to be creative,'' she said.   ''We know advertisers can get their messages across when they want to. They darn better want to get this message across: 'This is what we are collecting and this is how we are using it.' ''    Two members of the commission, Pamela Jones Harbour, an independent, and Jon Leibowitz, a Democrat, issued statements saying that while they support the commission's action, they hope for further regulation and possibly legislation on the issue.   ''With this Congress, there is not going to be a lot of patience for Big Brother Internet advertising without privacy protections,'' Mr. Leibowitz said. ''They invite legislation if they don't do a good job at self-regulation.''    There are two Republicans on the commission and one vacancy. President Obama has not yet named a commission chairman.   Groups that want better online privacy were mixed in their reaction. Some praised the new, tougher standards for targeted ads. But others argued that the commission did not go far enough to regulate all the different ways that Internet companies monitor users.   ''These are baby steps for privacy at best,'' said Jeff Chester, the director of the Center for Digital Democracy.  "
Law Students Teach Scalia About Privacy and the Web,"''TEACHING moment.'' A nice, hopeful phrase describing lessons learned from real life that help illuminate an academic subject -- the opposite of ''book learning.''   This spring, the students of an elective course on Internet privacy at Fordham Law School experienced a number of fascinating ''teaching moments'' during an assignment meant to demonstrate how much personal information is floating around online.   The assignment from the class's professor, Joel R. Reidenberg, was, admittedly, a bit provocative: create a dossier about Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia from what can be found on the Internet.     Why Justice Scalia? Well, the class had been discussing his recent dismissive comments about Internet privacy concerns at a conference. His summation, as reported by The Associated Press: ''Every single datum about my life is private? That's silly.''    A gauntlet of sorts had been thrown down -- though Professor Reidenberg said in an interview that he would disagree with that interpretation. The assignment, he said, was ''not about embarrassing anyone, not about targeting Scalia in the sense of choosing him because of anything about his work on the court.'' (He was also quick to point out that the year before, the assignment focused on himself.)   Justice Scalia was a natural choice -- a highly public figure with good reason to guard his privacy. Good luck, for example, finding a direct phone number for his chambers.    Yet the class managed to create a dossier of 15 pages, Professor Reidenberg reported to a conference on privacy at Fordham, that included the justice's home address and home phone number, his wife's personal e-mail address and the TV shows and food he prefers.   How could there not be an aspect of poetic justice in creating the dossier: Still think the issue is ''silly,'' your honor? Teaching moments, after all, are not only for students.   The dossier was never intended to be made public (though, the professor points out, since the law protects only material collected to assess a job applicant, it could have been) and Justice Scalia was never supposed to know about the assignment, much the way many of us are blithely unaware about what can be discovered about ourselves online.   Professor Reidenberg's comments at the conference were picked up by a Web site, Above the Law, and the genie was out of the bottle, speeded on its way with the headline ''What Fordham Knows About Justice Scalia.''   Another teaching moment. Mr. Reidenberg was speaking about the loss of ''practical obscurity,'' that is, the idea that certain personal information may always have been publicly available -- down at the courthouse, say -- but in reality was very hard to discover and disseminate.    ''I was giving an academic paper in an academic conference, speaking about the loss of practical obscurity, and the example I use is plucked out of context and becomes a national story,'' he said.   When word leaked about the dossier, Mr. Reidenberg offered to show Justice Scalia what the class had collected, but he did not respond.   Privacy, and its breach, have been issues for millennia -- Justice Scalia made his remarks about Internet privacy at a conference organized by the Institute of American and Talmudic Law titled ''The Right to Privacy and Individual Liberties From Ancient Times to the Cyberspace Age.'' But technology is placing new stress on our laws, and the solutions are not always easy ones.    It is valuable, for example, to be able to learn who has recently been arrested for drunken driving, but today we live in a world where you can quickly get directions to and a picture of the home of every sex offender, or drunken driver, in a three-mile radius.   It is not only that personal information whisks around the globe, landing before anyone with an Internet connection, but also that there is so much of it.    ''In the individual case, it might be innocuous, say the fact that I like Coke and not Pepsi,'' said Daniel J. Solove, a law professor at George Washington University, whose blog, Concurring Opinions, has been alive with debate about the Fordham research project. ''When you put together pieces of information, it becomes different. When you have a record of everything you ever bought over the years, you can make inferences about your health, financial situation and interests.''   Chris Reid, a third-year law student at Fordham who took Mr. Reidenberg's class last year, said that while his peers had a more relaxed view of privacy on the Internet, ''our generation needs to be reminded.''    ''People are willing to give up a lot of privacy for a small benefit. They don't know the full cost.''    Justice Scalia declined an interview request through a spokeswoman but he did give a response about the episode to Above the Law.    ''I stand by my remark at the Institute of American and Talmudic Law conference that it is silly to think that every single datum about my life is private. I was referring, of course, to whether every single datum about my life deserves privacy protection in law.   ''It is not a rare phenomenon that what is legal may also be quite irresponsible. That appears in the First Amendment context all the time. What can be said often should not be said. Prof. Reidenberg's exercise is an example of perfectly legal, abominably poor judgment. Since he was not teaching a course in judgment, I presume he felt no responsibility to display any.''   A teaching moment, but not necessarily a learned one. "
Facebook to Offer New Features to Allow Users to Control Privacy of Information,"its population of more than 200 million users -- is also part of its Achilles' heel. As more people join and connect with more people they know, the chances grow that one's embarrassing photographs from a night of carousing might be seen by the wrong person.   To help remedy this, the company  is testing new controls that will allow members to specify which groups or individuals are able to see each text update, photo or video they post on the site. For example, the controls would make it easy for a user to remind all the family members on Facebook about a surprise birthday party, while excluding the birthday girl.     ''Our overall philosophy is that people should be as open or as closed as they want to be,'' said Chris Kelly, chief privacy officer for the company, in a conference call with reporters Wednesday to discuss the changes.    For now the new features are available only to a limited number  of users, but  the company said it planned to provide them eventually to everyone on the site.   The changes are part of Facebook's effort to simplify its privacy settings, which had ballooned to more than six pages and 40 different options. The company said that fewer than a quarter of its users regularly adjusted privacy settings, so it planned to condense them into a single, easy-to-navigate page.   ''When tools are simple, people are more likely to use them,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''If there are too many options, users  are not fully appreciating what they are sharing with whom.''   Recent changes at Facebook -- including a redesign that focused attention on so-called status messages and allowing users to claim custom Web addresses -- have led to speculation that the company is responding to the popularity of Twitter, which has become something of a real-time broadcasting service.    In another example, Facebook is giving members over the age of 18 the option of sharing updates and other personal information with everyone on the Internet, much like Twitter.    When asked if Facebook was trying to keep up with Twitter, Brandee Barker, Facebook's director of communications, said the new settings were about encouraging more connections between people. ''Sharing has always been at the core of our product,'' she said. ''By recommending more open defaults, more people will be able to connect on the site.''    The changes reflect the struggle for users' time and attention that start-ups like Facebook and Twitter engage in every day, said Sarah Milstein, co-author of ''The Twitter Book,'' a guide for companies that want to use Twitter.    ''Part of what made Twitter successful is its simplicity,'' Ms. Milstein said. ''There's also been an indication that public messages can be more valuable.''    Ms. Milstein added that for Facebook, a company that is still figuring out how to generate profits from its users, encouraging them to share more information publicly could eventually open up new sources of revenue.    Although Facebook said it was still determining whether status updates that users chose to make public would appear in results from search engines like Google, the company acknowledged that it was testing a search engine that would be able to scan through such material. ''There could be a way to make money off of that public data,'' Ms. Milstein said.   The new controls will come as something of a relief to many Facebook users who are struggling to work out how best to share things on the site, said Charlene Li, founder of the digital strategy firm Altimeter Group.   ''I have a wide mix of friends on Facebook and have never felt comfortable sharing everything I do with all of them,'' Ms. Li said in an e-mail exchange. ''So I'm looking forward to having a 'girlfriend' feed where I can dish with my close girlfriends, but also use Facebook to broadcast to everyone, even outside of Facebook.'' "
"Online Ads Follow Web Users, And Get Much More Personal","For all the concern and uproar over online privacy, marketers and data companies have always known much more about consumers' offline lives, like income, credit score, home ownership, even what car they drive and whether they have a hunting license. Recently, some of these companies have started connecting this mountain of information to consumers' browsers.   The result is a sea change in the way consumers encounter the Web. Not only will people see customized advertising, they will see different versions of Web sites from other consumers and even receive different discount offers while shopping -- all based on information from their offline history. Two women in adjoining offices could go to the same cosmetic site, but one might see a $300 Missoni perfume, the other the house-brand lipstick on sale for $2.    The technology that makes the connection is nothing new -- it is a tiny piece of code called a cookie that is placed on a hard drive. But the information it holds is. And it is all done invisibly.    ''Now, you're traveling the Internet with a cookie that indicates you're this type of consumer: age group X, income level, urban versus rural, presence of children in the household,'' said Trey Barrett, a product leader at Acxiom, one of the companies offering this linking to marketers.   Advertisers and marketers say this specificity is useful, taking out the guesswork involved in online-only profiling, and showing products to the people most likely to be interested. Retailers including Gap and Victoria's Secret are using this tactic.    But consumer advocates say such unseen tracking is troubling. On the old Internet, nobody knew you were a dog. On the new targeted Internet, they now know what kind of dog you are, your favorite leash color, the last time you had fleas and the date you were neutered.   ''The industry's love affair with persistent cookies has made it virtually impossible for users to go online without being tracked and profiled,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, in an e-mail message.   While Congress has been holding hearings on online privacy lately, the sessions have focused on online behavioral targeting. The industry has argued that no government intervention is needed, an argument that the Federal Trade Commission has so far accepted.   Consumers can avoid cookie-based tracking by deleting cookies from their computers or setting their browsers not to accept cookies. But few do, and privacy advocates say it is easy for companies to add cookies without users noticing.   For decades, data companies like Experian and Acxiom have compiled reams of information on every American: Acxiom estimates it has 1,500 pieces of data on every American, based on information from warranty cards, bridal and birth registries, magazine subscriptions, public records and even dog registrations with the American Kennel Club.   Patrick Williams, the publisher of the personal finance magazine Worth, recently asked Acxiom to find the names and addresses of 10,000 Americans from each of 11 cities who had houses worth more than $1 million, net worth of over $2 million, lived within a few miles of other rich people and subscribed to business publications.    ''They are the scariest data research company around -- they know far too much,'' said Mr. Williams, who said he was very happy with the amount of information it gave him.   Companies like Acxiom and a competitor, Datran Media,  make the connection between online and offline data when a person registers on a Web site or clicks through on an  e-mail message from a marketer.   Datran's cookies include 50 to 100 pieces of information. Both companies say cookie data is anonymous and generalized. Datran and Acxiom then sell advertising on Web sites like NBC.com, Facebook and Yahoo to companies that use their data.   For marketers, all this data is a boon. Beltone New England, a hearing-aid company, asked Datran to find people online who were 65 and over, owned a house, were head of a household, made more than $35,000 a year and lived in New England so it could show them ads. Datran also tested the same ads with a wider group of people.    ''What was surprising was we found the majority of responders turned out to be women 35 to 40 who had elderly parents at home,'' said Perry Ebel, Beltone's director of marketing and business development. He said he was changing his offline marketing to include that group.    By using real-world data online, marketers can customize messages even further -- showing different products to people with different shopping habits, whether it is in ads, an e-mail message or in semipersonalized Web pages.    Rodale, which publishes books along with magazines like Men's Health and Prevention, uses Acxiom data to help determine which promotional e-mails to send to which customers. Offers aimed at women might be accompanied by an e-mail message offering a Father's Day subscription to Men's Health for him and a free book on losing belly fat for her. Young men might get another offer -- a book on sex positions. Some  marketers are using offline data more subtly -- for example, showing a budget shopper a discount offer and a regular shopper a full-price section.    ''The people who buy less frequently and are most price-conscious may get a better deal than someone who buys more frequently, who would buy anyway,'' said Christopher S. Marriott, global managing director of Acxiom Digital, a division of Acxiom.    Of course, shoppers would have little reason to think their experience or their ads are being personalized based on their home value or Volvo ownership.   ''It is a little Big Brother-ish,'' said Betsy Coggswell, 49, a social worker in Fullerton, Calif., who shops online regularly. Still, she said, she wasn't shocked. ''Every time you put out information about yourself -- people have got to understand -- it's going to be collected by somebody.''   Some online companies avoid matching online and offline profiles. In 2000, DoubleClick abandoned plans to connect online and offline data after a huge outcry. Google, which later acquired DoubleClick, has been conducting studies that connect the two areas, but it  does not currently collect or serve ads based on such personal information without user permission, Sandra Heikkinen, a Google spokeswoman, said.   While Acxiom, Datran and some of their partners address their use of tracking in their privacy policies, such policies have become worthless, Mr. Rotenberg said. ''Real transparency means that the user gets access to the information, not to a policy about the information,'' he said.   Paul M. Schwartz, a law professor and privacy expert at the law school of the University of California, Berkeley, said the unwitting participation by consumers makes online marketing different from offline.   ''Interactive media really gets into this creepy Orwellian thing, where it's a record of our thoughts on the way to decision-making,'' he said. ''We're like the data-input clerks now for the industry.'' "
Fresh Views At Agency Overseeing Online Ads,"Most of the online world is based on a simple, if unarticulated, agreement: consumers browse Web sites  free, and in return, they give up data --  like their gender  or income level -- which the sites use to aim their advertisements.   The new head of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission, David C. Vladeck, says it is time for that to change. In an interview,  Mr. Vladeck outlined plans that could upset the online advertising ecosystem. Privacy policies have become useless, the commission's standards for the cases it reviews are too narrow, and some online tracking is ''Orwellian,'' Mr. Vladeck said.     After eight years of what privacy advocates and the industry saw as a relatively pro-business commission, Mr. Vladeck,  has made a splash. In June, the commission settled a case with Sears that was a warning shot to companies that thought their privacy policies protected them. In just over six weeks on the job, he has asked Congress for a bigger budget and for a streamlined way to create regulations. And he said he would hire technologists to help analyze online marketers' tracking.   ''These are pretty aggressive moves for an agency of a new administration,'' said Charles  Kennedy, who handles privacy cases at Morrison & Foerster.    But some executives say they are wary of too much intervention. ''We have to be very, very careful not to take steps that will upset'' the Internet economy, said Stuart P. Ingis, a partner at the law firm Venable who is counsel to an ad industry consortium.    Mr. Vladeck's first moves have been to pick  apart industry groups' proposed self-regulatory principles and to meet with companies to discuss online ad guidelines.   ''The frameworks that we've been using historically for privacy are no longer sufficient,'' Mr. Vladeck said.    Though the privacy issues are new to Mr. Vladeck, he appears to have studied quickly -- he didn't  refer to  notes during an interview. A professor at Georgetown Law  for seven years, he also spent 26 years as a litigator with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, a public-interest law firm. ''There is a sense of urgency around here,'' he said. ''Consumers, I don't think are sufficiently protected under the current regime.''   He said his broad mission was to redefine how the commission looked at online privacy. Predecessors at the agency had different approaches to regulating online behavior, including whether companies were causing harm to consumers, and instructing companies to write privacy policies, Mr. Vladeck said.   The Sears case suggested that Mr. Vladeck had adopted a new approach. Sears had offered customers $10 to download software onto their computers, saying it would track their browsing. The commission said that the software also collected information like prescription records and bank statements. Sears settled with the commission in June.    It wasn't a case that caused economic harm, though. Rather than taking money from consumers, Sears was paying them for the tracking. ''Under the harm framework, we couldn't have brought that case,'' Mr. Vladeck said. (Though he hadn't officially started at the commission, and the case was under way before he joined, he was consulting for it when the settlement was announced.) Now, Mr. Vladeck indicated, the commission would begin considering not just whether companies caused monetary harm, but whether they violated consumers' dignity.   ''There's a huge dignity interest wrapped up in having somebody looking at your financial records when they have no business doing that,'' he said.    The Sears case also signaled a departure from what the commission's presumed position that as long as marketers wrote detailed privacy policies, they were protected. Sears had included information about tracking in its user license agreement, but that wasn't good enough anymore, Mr. Vladeck said.   ''I don't believe that most consumers either read them, or if they read them, really understand it,'' he said.      Mr. Vladeck has signaled that he will make changes, but he has not specified what they will be, and he said he did not  necessarily support new rules.   ''We're not committing ourselves to imposing regulation,'' he said. ''What we would like is to figure out useful tools and a more comprehensive way of looking at privacy protections that may obviate the need for rules.''   In February, before Mr. Vladeck joined the commission, it issued a report on what it wanted to see from online advertising companies. Industry groups scrambled to respond with their own report, issued in July, outlining how they would regulate themselves. Their views are somewhat in line with Mr. Vladeck's, but they differ in significant areas.  For instance, Mr. Vladeck said he would consider requiring sites collecting personal data to get consumers' assent whenever they visit the site (an ''opt-in'').   But marketers say such a tactic would be disastrous. ''It's impossible to communicate the value proposition to a consumer at the point of an advertisement,'' said Matt Wise,  chief executive of Q Interactive, a Chicago online marketing firm. Mandatory opt-in ''would be a tremendous setback in innovation,'' he said.    The changes Mr. Vladeck is considering could mean a different online world, where sites couldn't depend on targeted ads to make money. But could a site refuse to allow access to people who wouldn't hand over data?   Mr. Vladeck said that the commission would have to consider whether that meant businesses were treating consumers unfairly, but over all,  he said he was not troubled by the problems this might pose for marketers.    ''Let people vote with their feet,'' he said. ''''If the marketers are right, and the consumers like behavioral advertising, then it should be no big deal.   ''The message is, you have to be more transparent about what it is you're doing.'' "
Protecting Privacy Online,"To the Editor:   You make a good point about the need for privacy safeguards for government Web sites (''The Government and the Web,'' editorial, Aug. 25). But the devil is truly in the details.    Cookie management techniques that you describe are simply not effective. Advertising networks use ''opt out'' cookies, which treat a deleted cookie as permission to track. And Java-based cookies are essentially invisible to users. Either way, deleting cookies in the browser software is mostly pointless.   Warning notices and opting-out for access to government Web sites are also not helpful. Instead of agencies' improving their privacy practices, people seeking public information online will be told to go elsewhere.   Still, the privacy problem with government Web sites may be less about government profiling and more about commercial exploitation. Companies, such as Google, want to use persistent cookies on government Web sites so that they can tie citizen access to government data to their own Web-based services.   It's the commercial use of the data that has the vendors leaning on the government to relax the privacy rules. According to one document obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center under the Freedom of Information Act, Google actually obtained a waiver of all privacy regulations so that it could track users visiting certain government Web sites.   Plugging that new loophole would be a good way to begin to establish confidence in Web-based government services. Marc Rotenberg   Washington, Aug. 26, 2009   The writer is president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. "
When 2+2 Equals a Privacy Question,"TIME to revisit the always compelling -- and often disconcerting -- debate over digital privacy. So, what might your movie picks and your medical records have in common?   How about a potentially false sense of control over who can see your user history?   While Netflix and some health care concerns say they have been able to offer study data to researchers stripped of specific personal details like your name, phone number and e-mail address, in some cases researchers may be able to re-identify you by correlating anonymous information with the digital trail that you've left on blogs, chat rooms and Twitter.    Of course, you may be fine with that. On the other hand, you may not want complete strangers rummaging around in your history of movie selections or medical needs.    For example, contestants in Netflix's competition to improve its recommendation software received a training data set containing the movie preferences of more than 480,000 customers who had, as they say in the trade, been ''de-identified.'' But as part of a privacy experiment, a pair of computer scientists at the University of Texas at Austin decided to see if it was possible to re-identify those unnamed movie fans.   By comparing the film preferences of some anonymous Netflix customers with personal profiles on imdb.com, the Internet movie database, the researchers said they easily re-identified some people because they had posted their e-mail addresses or other distinguishing information online.    Vitaly Shmatikov, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin and a co-author of the ''de-anonymization'' study, says the researchers were able to analyze users' public postings and connect that to their Netflix preferences -- including how a person may have rated films with controversial themes. Those are choices a person may or may not want to make public, Mr. Shmatikov said.    Steve Swasey, a Netflix spokesman, disputed the study's conclusions, saying the customers were not re-identifiable because Netflix had altered the data set before sending it to contestants.   ''There is no way with certainty that anyone could link a Netflix member with the data Netflix has disclosed by linking it with any publicly available data,'' he said. ''The anonymity of the information is comparable to the strictest federal standards for anonymizing personal health information.''   Nevertheless, the Texas researchers say they were indeed able to positively identify Netflix customers, and some privacy advocates say their study raises questions about whether newly strengthened laws governing the security of electronic health records -- which contain information on diagnoses and treatments entered by health care providers -- may offer incomplete privacy protection. Leaked movie preferences might embarrass or stereotype you, they said. But information extracted from medical records and then linked back to you, they said, has the potential to cause social, professional and financial harm.   ''Movie records can be sensitive in some cases; it could be embarrassing for someone to find out I like romantic comedies,'' Mr. Shmatikov, the computer scientist, said in a recent phone interview.  ''But definitely for health records, this is a huge issue.''    And you don't need records containing a person's name and address to figure out to whom the records belong, he said, ''As our research shows, pretty much any information that distinguishes one person from another can be used to re-identify records.''   The idea of an entirely paperless medical system holds the promise of more efficient and cost-effective care. And, with the incentive of stimulus package money, many companies are rushing to sell clinical information systems to streamline services like patient scheduling, sample tracking, and billing at hospitals and clinics.    In some cases, the same companies that sell data management systems to hospitals and physicians also store that information and then repackage it to make money on other services.    The clinical information systems market in the United States has sales of $8 billion to $10 billion annually, and about 5 percent of that comes from data and analysis, according to estimates by George Hill, an analyst at Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank.    But by 2020, when a vast majority of American health providers are expected to have electronic health systems, the data mining component alone could generate sales of up to $5 billion, Mr. Hill said. Demand for the data is likely to be robust. Policy makers and hospitals will want to dig into it to analyze physician practices and glean information about patient health trends.    Big players like the Cerner Corporation, which maintains electronic health systems for 8,000 clients, including large hospitals and retail clinics, and smaller players like Practice Fusion, which offers its Web-based health record systems free to health care providers, say they make use of patient data collected from their clients.   A spokeswoman for Cerner, whose Web site promotes its ''data mining of our vast warehouse of electronic health records,'' said the company shares de-identified patient data with researchers or drug companies looking for patients to participate in clinical trials. The patient records are ''double scrubbed,'' she said, explaining that the company removes personal data like names and addresses before it runs a search using a numbered code for each patient.    Other sensitive information, like mental health records, might be removed before the patient data is sent out, she said.   The Web site of Practice Fusion, meanwhile, quotes Ryan Howard, the chief executive, as saying that the company subsidizes its free record-keeping systems by selling de-identified data to insurance groups, clinical researchers and pharmaceutical companies. In an interview, however, Mr. Howard said Practice Fusion had not yet started selling patient information but that it intended to do so.   NEW regulations require notifying patients if their personally identifiable medical information gets loose, and they prohibit selling protected health records. But privacy advocates said electronic health records remain vulnerable because no federal law now forbids the sale of de-identified health care data.    In 1997, for example, a researcher identified the medical records of William Weld, then the governor of Massachusetts, by correlating birthdays, ZIP codes and gender in voter registration rolls and information published by the state's government insurance commission.   There are no current federal laws against re-identification, said Dr. Deborah Peel, a psychiatrist who is a director of Patient Privacy Rights, a nonprofit watchdog group in Austin, Tex.   ''Once personal health data gets out there, it's like the Paris Hilton sex tape,'' Dr. Peel said. ''It is going to be out there forever.''  "
Groups Far Apart on Online Privacy Oversight,"  IF online privacy was once an obscure policy subject, it has come front and center. That much was apparent at the standing-room-only roundtable on privacy and technology that the Federal Trade Commission held here on Monday.   The commission had brought in academics, consumer advocates and executives from Google, Microsoft and Wal-Mart to debate what needs to change to address privacy issues online.   It was not just a theoretical question. The commission has been examining whether online privacy should be regulated. The debate has grown louder as technology companies are tracking and profiling people in new ways, Congress is showing an interest in the subject, and companies are trying to avoid government intervention.    ''The stakes are so big here,'' said Berin Szoka, director of the Center for Internet Freedom at the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a research organization that favors deregulation. New regulations, he said, would ''make a real difference.'' Although no major policy decisions were made, the forum showed a heightened awareness of online privacy issues.    But the discussion also indicated just how far apart the groups were from reaching a consensus. Panelists even debated basic premises, like  how aware consumers were of what tracking was taking place online.   ''Generally speaking, they know very, very little about what goes on online, under the screen, under the hood. The kinds of things they don't know would surprise many people around here,'' said Joseph Turow, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.   Lorrie Faith Cranor, an associate professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon, said that not only did consumers not understand behavioral advertising, but they also ''are confused about which part of a Web page is advertising.''   But others, particularly from the industry, said well-informed consumers had plenty of options. Linda A. Woolley, executive vice president for government affairs at the Direct Marketing Association, an industry trade group, said consumers could easily erase cookies or reset privacy settings on their browser.  ''If you're of a mind to do private browsing, and doing everything anonymously, the tools are out there,'' she said.   But others say the onus should not be on end users.  ''Putting the substantial burden on consumers is not the right way to go about it,'' said Melissa Ngo, the publisher of the blog Privacy Lives.   Questions from the commission's staff members focused on consumers' perceptions: Do they understand privacy policies? Are they willing to give up information in exchange for free online services and news? What kind of notices might inform consumers about what was happening online, and how could industry or government get consumers to understand  these notices?    At Google, giving consumers access to some information has not led to a revolution, said Alan Davidson, the company's director of United States public policy and government affairs.  This year,  Google began running online advertisements based on consumers' online behavior patterns. But the company has also allowed consumers to see and edit the ad categories that they had been grouped in.  Mr. Davidson said that the Google pages with that information had pulled in tens of thousands of visitors weekly. (That is a low number, given Google's huge audience.)   ''We had the assumption that people who were interested in privacy and were going to visit the site would all be opting out,'' he  said, but that was not the case.    For every one person who opts out, four people change the categories they have fallen into, and 10 people do nothing.  ''To simply say that people aren't informed, and if you inform them they want to get rid of this stuff, is probably too simplistic a view,'' he said.  ''Many consumers do understand there is a bargain here.''    But Mr. Turow argued that Mr. Davidson was presenting  its privacy pages as too innocuous.   ''It appears incredibly benign,'' he said of the categorization that Google was doing.  ''It almost makes some people who worry about privacy look foolish, because it says, 'You like bicycles.' ''   ''What is not shown in this kind of thing, and possibly because Google doesn't do this sort of thing -- maybe because they don't implement it yet -- are the various kinds of psychographic, demographic activities that go on behind the screens,'' he said.   A similar divide occurred during other panels, with companies generally arguing that the targeting made for more useful ads, and privacy advocates saying that such measures went too far. Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum, said that although individual companies usually allow people to decline targeted ads, the patchwork of policies was overwhelming.  ''How on earth is a consumer supposed to find out about all of them?'' she asked.    Industry groups had  scrambled to get ahead of some  questions raised at the roundtable.   On Monday, Yahooformally announced that it would offer pages in its privacy section that showed consumers  what assumptions the company had made about them for advertising purposes. Consumers can then edit those assumptions, or choose to decline ads that target them. ''It gives consumers an unparalleled view of the conclusions that we've drawn or the guesses that we've made about their interests,'' Anne Toth, Yahoo's vice president for policy and head of privacy, said in an interview.   Yahoo is  trying out  icons and text in ads that explain that the ad is behaviorally targeted. The icons and text were created by the Future of Privacy Forum, which is testing results, hoping other companies will adopt them.    Last week, the Interactive Advertising Bureau started an ad campaign to inform the public about online privacy  from the companies' perspective.   ''The industry had clearly lagged behind for many years,'' said the group's chief executive, Randall Rothenberg. ''While this is a response to the F.T.C.'s concerns about education, it also precedes the F.T.C.'s concerns.''   Resembling a 1950s B-movie poster, one ad reads: ''Advertising is creepy.'' The ads are supposed to be arresting,  said Trevor Kaufman, the chief executive of Schematic, a unit of WPP, which created the campaign. Those who click on the ad see a screen with more information about privacy, and a link to a Web site.      ''We have been pretty consistent in saying we believe that for a fast-moving area like Internet technology, self-regulation, we have always felt, is for us the best way to go,'' Ms. Toth said. ''Legislation is very slow to move. Once you have a law in place, it doesn't always keep up with technology.''  "
Tracked for Ads? Many Americans Say No Thanks,"ABOUT two-thirds of Americans object to online tracking by advertisers -- and that number rises once they learn the different ways marketers are following their online movements, according to a new survey from professors at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California, Berkeley.   The professors say they believe the study, scheduled for release on Wednesday, is the first independent, nationally representative telephone survey on behavioral advertising.    The topic may be technical, but it has become a hot political issue. Privacy advocates are telling Congress and the Federal Trade Commission that tracking of online activities by Web sites and advertisers has gone too far, and the lawmakers seem to be listening. Representative Rick Boucher, Democrat of Virginia, wrote in an article for The Hill last week that he planned to introduce privacy legislation. And David Vladeck, head of consumer protection for the F.T.C., has signaled that he will examine data privacy issues closely.   Marketers  are arguing that advertising supports free online content. Major advertising trade groups proposed in Julysome measures that they hoped would fend off regulation, like a clear notice to consumers  when they were  being tracked.   The data in this area, however, has been largely limited to company-financed research or Internet-based research, which survey experts say they believe is not representative of all Americans. So the study -- among the first independent surveys to examine this issue -- has attracted widespread interest.   ''This research is going to ignite an intense debate on both sides of the Atlantic on what the appropriate policy should be,'' said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the privacy group Center for Digital Democracy, which did not work on the study.    The study's authors hired a survey company to conduct interviews with 1,000 adult Internet users. The interview, which lasted about 20 minutes, included questions like ''Please tell me whether or not you want the Web sites you visit to give you discounts that are tailored to your interests.'' The results were later adjusted to reflect Census Bureau patterns in categories like sex, age, population density and telephone usage.    Tailored ads in general did not appeal to 66 percent of respondents. Then the respondents were told about different ways companies tailor ads: by following what someone does on the company's  site, on other sites and in offline places like stores.    The respondents' aversion to tailored ads increased once they learned about targeting methods. In addition to the original 66 percent that said tailored ads were ''not O.K.,'' an additional 7 percent said such ads were not O.K. when they were tracked on the site. An additional 18 percent said it was not O.K. when they were tracked via other Web sites, and an additional 20 percent said it was not O.K. when they were tracked offline.    The survey company also asked about customized discounts and customized news. Fifty-one percent of respondents said that tailored discounts were O.K., and 58 percent said that customized news was fine.   On the advertising question, there was not a big difference between age groups. Marketers often use teenagers' behavior on Facebook as anecdotal evidence that they do not mind handing over information. But 55 percent of respondents from 18 to 24 objected to tailored advertising.   ''We sometimes think that the younger adults in the United States don't care about this stuff, and I would suggest that's an exaggeration,'' said Joseph Turow, lead author of the study and a professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. His co-authors are professors at Berkeley's law school and at the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.   The survey also asked nine true-or-false questions about privacy laws  to see how knowledgeable Americans were about protection, including ''If a Web site has a privacy policy, it means that the site cannot share information about you with other companies, unless you give the Web site your permission.'' (The correct answer is ''false.'') On only one question, regarding sweepstakes, was answered correctly by more than half of respondents.    Finally, the survey sought opinions on laws regarding tracking, asking if there should be a law that gave people the right to know everything a Web site knew about them. Sixty-nine percent of respondents said yes. Respondents also overwhelmingly supported a hypothetical law that required Web sites and advertising companies to delete all information about an individual upon request; 92 percent endorsed it.   ''I don't think that behavioral targeting is something that we should eliminate, but I do think that we're at a cusp of a new era, and the kinds of information that companies share and have today is nothing like we'll see 10 years from now,'' Professor  Turow said. He said he would like ''a regime in which people feel they have control over the data that marketers collect about them. The most important thing is to bring the public into the picture, which is not going on right now.''   Stuart P. Ingis, a partner at the law firm Venable who represents the industry trade groups' self-regulation coalition, said that the industry was taking steps to explain to consumers how behavioral targeting worked.   ''The more people understand the practices and how the data is actually being used, that's when the concerns disappear,'' he said.  Just because many Americans are not in favor of something does not mean it should be banned, he said, citing negative feelings about taxes.    But Mr. Chester, whose group is part of a privacy coalition calling for Congressional action, said the survey would be helpful. ''This research gives the F.T.C. and Congress a political green light to go ahead and enact effective, but reasonable, rules and policies,'' he said. "
Big Web Attack on Twitter Is Third Assault This Year,"An online attack Friday morning on Twitter was the result of the simplest of security breaches: someone got the password to enter the master directory of Twitter's Internet addresses and then redirected users to an alternate site instead.   No user information appears to have been stolen in the attack. But the security breach -- the third major one at Twitter this year --  underscores the continuing weakness of the company's systems as its micro-blogging service is becoming more important to business and even global politics.   The incident also highlights a basic vulnerability in the way life is lived as it becomes increasingly digital: With so much vital information stored on the Web, people are only as safe as their passwords.   During the assault, which security analysts said began about 1 a.m. and lasted roughly an hour, hackers tinkered with Twitter's domain name servers, which are hosted by a Manchester, N.H., company called Dyn. When Web surfers tried to reach Twitter's pages, they were sent instead to a site for the ''Iranian Cyber Army,'' which claimed responsibility  for the attack.    The domain names were eventually fixed and redirected back to the correct servers at about 2 a.m., but because of  time the reset took, Twitter's Web site was not fully functional again until an hour later, according to Rod Rasmussen, president of Internet Identity, an Internet security company, who watched the attacks unfold in real time through a new technology his company is  building.   Twitter, which is based in San Francisco, declined to discuss details of the attack, and it was not clear  how its  security was compromised.    But Dan Kaminsky, director of penetration testing with the security firm IOActive, said that ''in terms of this sort'' of domain name server attack, ''this is easily one of the most common hacks.'' He said that a recent report by Verizon Communications found that 61 percent of Internet security breaches happen through simple password failures.   Security specialists say it will be extremely difficult to determine who was behind the attack. There was some indication  that the attack came from within the United States, but authorities are still investigating.    Beth Jones, a senior threat researcher at the Internet security firm Sophos, said the attack did not look very sophisticated and probably was not the effort of a Web terrorist or other professional. ''It could have been any number of people doing it,'' she said.    Ms. Jones said the incident may have been ''hacktivism,'' an attack with  a social or political motivation. ''The point could purely be just to prove the site is insecure,'' she said.    Although the attack did not appear malicious, it easily could have been, Ms. Jones said.   ''Instead of throwing up a banner to cover the site, what if it had been an exact replica of the home page?'' she said. ''If this attack had been a phishing page instead, who knows how many millions of credentials they could have gotten?''   The attack was another black eye for Twitter, which had two major security breaches this summer.    In July, the technology blog TechCrunch published internal Twitter documents that had been stolen by an unidentified hacker who apparently figured out an employee's e-mail password.   In August, unidentified attackers bombarded several social networking sites, including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, with millions of junk e-mail messages in an attempt to block the Web pages of a 34-year-old economics professor who was writing about a skirmish between Russia and the republic of Georgia. The other sites withstood the assault, one of the most common types of Internet attacks, but Twitter struggled with its service for days.   Roel Schouwenberg, a senior antivirus researcher at Kaspersky Lab, an Internet security company in Woburn, Mass., said the latest incident was an embarrassment to Twitter. ''Even if it was the fault of the hosting company, Twitter has a track record this year of having weak passwords and being compromised,'' he said.   In September, Twitter raised  $100 million from investors, adding  $55 million it had raised.  Despite all that new money, ''Twitter still doesn't seem to invest all that much in security,'' Mr. Schouwenberg said.   In a blog post Friday afternoon, Biz Stone, a co-founder of Twitter, confirmed that the hijacking occurred. ''The motive for this attack appears to have been focused on defacing our site, not aimed at users,'' he said. ''We don't believe any accounts were compromised.''    Mr. Stone and other company officials declined requests for interviews.   Twitter's vulnerability appears to have increased as it has grown in popularity. ''As soon as you become high profile, you are a much more interesting target to people,''  Mr. Schouwenberg said.   In November Twitter.com had more than 19 million unique visitors, an increase of 500 percent from Novemer 2008, according to Nielsen Mobile.   The company's  failures have not had a major impact on users, even businesses who are using it to communicate with customers or conduct transactions. From its very beginning, Twitter has experienced short failures, although they have become less frequent over the last year.   Tony Hsieh, chief executive of the shoe retailer Zappos.com and an avid user of Twitter on company matters, said Friday's breach  ''didn't concern me. I didn't even know about it.''   Richard Binhammer an executive at  Dell, which has generated $6.5 million in sales through Twitter, said that Twitter conversations tend to be sporadic anyway.   ''It's not like you're on it all the time, depending on it for everything,'' said Mr. Binhammer, who is active on the computer maker's Twitter accounts.  ''So when all of a sudden they have an outage, I'll pick up later, just like everybody else.''    Other companies said that they were watching Twitter's performance closely to make sure they could depend on it to meet their customer service needs.   Andy Dunn, chief executive of Bonobos, an e-commerce company, said he hoped to someday use Twitter as his primary way of communication with customers and others, replacing e-mail.   But the service would need to be more reliable to do so. ''We're not there yet,'' he said.   Laura Fitton, founder and chief executive of Oneforty, a start-up that aggregates listings of third-party Twitter services, is willing to be patient. ''Twitter's been around for three years and been dealt some pretty heavy blows,'' she said. ''And they're still standing. Each time, they still come out on top.'' "
Cadets Trade The Trenches For Firewalls,"CORRECTION APPENDED WEST POINT, N.Y. -- The Army forces were under attack. Communications were down, and the chain of command was broken. Pacing a makeshift bunker whose entrance was camouflaged with netting, the young man in battle fatigues barked at his comrades: ''They are flooding the e-mail server. Block it. I'll take the heat for it.'' These are the war games at West Point, at least last month, when a team of cadets spent four days struggling around the clock to establish a computer network and keep it operating while hackers from the National Security Agency in Maryland tried to infiltrate it with methods that an enemy might use. The N.S.A. made the cadets' task more difficult by planting viruses on some of the equipment, just as real-world hackers have done on millions of computers around the world. The competition was a final exam of sorts for a senior elective class. The cadets, who were computer science and information technology majors, competed against teams from the Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard and Merchant Marine as well as the Naval Postgraduate School and the Air Force Institute of Technology. Each team was judged on how well it subdued the threats from the N.S.A.  The cyberwar games at West Point are just one example of a heightened awareness across the military that it must treat the threat of a computer attack as seriously as it does an attack carried out by a bomber or combat brigade. There is hardly an American military unit or headquarters that has not been ordered to analyze the risk of cyberattacks to its mission -- and to train to counter them. If the hackers were to succeed, they could change information on the network and cripple Internet communications. In the desert outside Las Vegas, in a series of inconspicuous trailers, some of the most highly motivated hackers in the United States spend their days and nights probing the military's vast computer networks for weaknesses to exploit. These hackers -- many of whom got their start as teenagers devoted to computer screens in their basements -- have access to the latest in attack software. Some of it was developed by cryptologists at the N.S.A., the nation's largest intelligence agency, where most of the government's talent for breaking and making computer codes resides. The hackers have an official name -- the 57th Information Aggressor Squadron -- and a real home, Nellis Air Force Base. The Army last year created its own destination for computer experts, the Network Warfare Battalion, where many of the cadets in the cyberwar games hope to be assigned. But even so, the ranks are still small. The Defense Department today graduates only 80 students a year from its cyberwar schools, causing Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates to complain that the Pentagon is ''desperately short of people who have capabilities in this area in all the services, and we have to address it.'' Under current Pentagon budget proposals, the number of students cycled through the schools will be quadrupled in the next two years. Part of the Pentagon's effort to increase the military's capabilities are the annual cyberwar games played at the nation's military academies, including West Point, where young cadets in combat boots and buzz cuts talk megabytes instead of megatons on a campus dotted with statues of generals, historic armaments and old stone buildings. While the Pentagon has embraced the need for offensive cyberwarfare, there were no offensive maneuvers in the games last month, said Col. Joe Adams, who teaches Information Assurance and stood at the head of the classroom during the April exercise. Cadet Joshua Ewing said he and his fellow Blue Team members ''learn all the techniques that a hacker would do, and we try to beat a hacker.'' These strategies are not just theoretical. Most of these cadets will soon be sent to Afghanistan to carry out such work, Cadet Ewing said. When the military deploys in a combat zone or during a domestic emergency, establishing a secure Internet connection is an early priority. To keep things humming, the military's experts must fend off the ordinary chaos of the Internet as well as attacks devised to disable the communications system, like flooding e-mail servers with so many junk messages that they collapse. Underscoring how seriously the cadets were taking the April games, the sign above the darkened entranceway in Thayer Hall read ''Information Warfare Live Fire Range'' and the area was draped with camouflage netting. One group had to retrieve crucial information from a partly erased hard drive. One common method of hiding text, said Cadet Sean Storey, is to embed it in digital photographs; he had managed to find secret documents hidden this way. He was seeking a password needed to read encrypted e-mail he had located on the hard drive. Other cadets worked in tandem, as if plugging a leaky dam, to keep the entire system working as the N.S.A. hackers attacked the engine that runs a crucial database as well as the e-mail server. They shouted out various Internet addresses to inspect -- and usually block -- after getting clearance from referees. And there was that awkward moment when the cadet in charge, Salvatore Messina, had to act without clearance because the attack was so severe he couldn't even send an e-mail message. The cadets in this room do get their share of ribbing. But one cadet, Derek Taylor, said today's soldiers recognize that technological expertise can be as vital as brute force in saving lives. West Point takes the competition seriously. The cadets who helped install and secure the operating system spent a week setting it up. The dean gives a pep talk; professors bring food. Brian McCord, part of the team that installed the operating system, said he was chosen because his senior project was deeply reliant on Linux. The West Point team used this open-source operating system, freely available on the Internet, instead of relying on proprietary products from big-name companies like Microsoft or Sun Microsystems. ''It seems weird for the Army with its large contracts to be using Linux, but it's very cheap and very customizable,'' Cadet McCord said. It is also much easier to secure because ''you can tweak it for everything you need'' and there are not as many known ways to attack it, he said. West Point emerged victorious in the games last month. That means the academy, which has won five of the last nine competitions, can keep the Director's Cup trophy, which is displayed near a German Enigma encoding machine from World War II. Cracking the Enigma code helped the Allies win the war, and the machine is a stark reminder of the pivotal role of technology in warfare. Cyberwar: Computers, indispensable in peace, are becoming ever more important in political conflicts and open warfare. This series focuses on the growing use of computer power as a weapon. Correction: May 13, 2009, Wednesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about military training to counter computer attacks misstated part of the name of one institution that fielded a team in a competition to establish and protect a computer network against cyberattacks. It is the Naval Postgraduate School, not the Naval Postgraduate Academy. "
Hackers Exploit an Evolving Web,"The world's savviest hackers are on to the ''real-time Web'' and using it to devilish effect. The real-time Web is the fire hose of information coming from services like Twitter. The latest generation of Trojans -- nasty little programs that hacking gangs use to burrow onto your computer -- sends a Twitter-like stream of updates about everything you do back to their controllers, many of whom, researchers say, are in Eastern Europe.     Trojans once just accumulated secret diaries of your Web surfing and periodically sent the results to the hacker.   By going real time, hackers can get around some of the roadblocks that companies have put in their way. Most significant, they are now undeterred by systems that create temporary passwords, such as RSA's SecurID system, which involves a small gadget that displays a six-digit number that changes every minute based on a complex formula.   If your computer is infected, the Trojan zaps your temporary password back to the waiting hacker, who immediately uses it to log onto your account. Sometimes the hacker logs on from his own computer, probably using tricks to hide its location. Other times, the Trojan allows the hacker to control your computer, opening a browser session that you can't see.   ''What everybody thought was a very secure identification method, these guys found a low-tech means to get around it,'' said Joe Stewart, the director of malware research for SecureWorks, a software company. ''They don't break the encryption; they just log in at the same time you do.''  "
Building an Online Bulwark to Fend Off Identity Fraud,"A clotheshorse racked up thousands of dollars in mystery charges on a friend's credit card. Phantoms emptied your uncle's bank account. Someone took out a car loan in your colleague's name and stuck her with the bill.   Identity fraud has been on the rise, as criminal cunning may be mixing with desperation during the downturn. Schemes seem to multiply daily, as scammers often half a world away dream up new ways to steal data to enrich themselves. According to Javelin Strategy and Research, 9.9 million Americans were victims of identity theft in 2008, up from 8.1 million in 2007.   With all kinds of private information residing in all kinds of places, vigilance can be difficult. Using caution when surfing the Internet and keeping antivirus software up to date are vital steps, experts say, but they are not enough. And most tools for fighting identity fraud -- credit-monitoring services, fraud alerts and credit freezes -- are reactive, not proactive, and they primarily address abuse of financial accounts, not other types of identity fraud.    But a new breed of products is tackling the trickier matter of preventing identity theft. New approaches include scouring the Internet in search of signs that criminals have your information, so you can move to block them. Others focus on keeping your data away from criminals in the first place, locking it down while you bank, shop or do other personal tasks online. Here are some ways to keep your information yours.   ASSESSING RISK The Internet is awash in personal data, which means yours may never be found. Several services look for signs of sticky fingers, to know when data reaches the hands of criminals so people can act quickly.    With the help of partners like the United States Postal Service, Discover Card and companies that perform background checks, LifeLock monitors change-of-address filings and applications for credit cards and jobs made in the names of its customers, so it can alert them. TrustedID, a LifeLock competitor, recently introduced a service that analyzes both public and proprietary data to assess a person's risk of identity theft -- for example, the risk would increase if a person's Social Security number was found to be associated with a different address -- and recommends actions to lower your risk score.   LifeLock and CardCops, among others, scour the Internet and hacker chat rooms and warn customers if their data is spotted. LifeLock, for one, also tries to infiltrate hacker communities.    Perhaps the most interesting new arrival in this space is StolenIDsearch.com, a site operated by TrustedID, which uses a database created by Colin Holder, a 30-year veteran of Scotland Yard, that contains stolen records gathered from longtime, trusted informants.    The database holds about 138 million records tied to an estimated 54 million people, about 98 percent of whom live in the United States, and searching it is free. ''It shows you who the bad guys are looking for: the rich Americans,'' said Scott Mitic, TrustedID's chief.    If any personal information -- e-mail address and password, credit card number, Social Security number, bank account login details -- is there, the site will describe, generically, what it has. It costs $15 to see the records, which Mr. Holder says covers administrative costs and helps ensure that only people entitled to the information receive it. (He also provides the data to banks and law enforcement agencies.)    SIDESTEPPING MALWARE Other products focus on outmaneuvering malicious programs that infiltrate PCs. Such malware has mushroomed recently, and antivirus companies have struggled to catch every new attack. SafeCentral ($40 for up to three computers; Windows only), a product from the security software company Authentium, protects users even if there's malware on the computer. It includes a stripped-down and secure browser to use when banking, trading stocks, viewing health information or shopping online.    When a user visits such a site, SafeCentral asks if the user wants to proceed securely. If the answer is yes, a background resembling armor plating appears. In this safe room of sorts, certain Windows features regularly abused by attackers have been disabled.    Computer programming interfaces known as A.P.I.'s, which game makers can use to turn keyboards into controllers, for example, are turned off because ''keylogger'' programs use them to capture information. SafeCentral also turns screenshots of Web pages blank to defeat these programs. Also off are A.P.I.'s that programmers use for browser plug-ins. This stops malicious plug-ins that monitor encrypted Web sessions -- the ones where the URL changes from ''http'' to ''https'' -- in case credit card numbers are transmitted.    And because so-called phishing scams use fake Web sites  to collect username and password information, SafeCentral takes an extra step to verify the authenticity of the sites it visits.    GIVE OUT NOTHING Another alternative is to avoid sharing information online in the first place. Kemesa, a software company, has created a shopping-safety product called Shop Shield that starts with a familiar browser-based tool for managing passwords and auto-filling Web forms -- which helps defend against keyloggers (which can record every keystroke made on a keyboard). In addition, Shop Shield users can give online merchants anonymous personal data, like single-use credit card numbers and specialized e-mail addresses.    Of course, you have to trust Kemesa with your personal  information. ''They become a target. They're very tempting now,'' Mr. Vamosi of Javelin said.    Kemesa says it has created a ''digital fortress.'' To start, the product (which uses an add-on for the Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers and a Web site), puts an encrypted token on the computer, which makes it extremely difficult for a remote attacker to gain access to personal records. This also means the user must authorize each computer to run the program.    At Kemesa, customer information is not just encrypted, it's broken up into tiny pieces that are then stored in different databases on different networks, making reassembly by an attacker grueling. It also monitors for intrusions, regularly tests its defenses, keeps its physical location in lockdown and otherwise sticks to Defense Department security standards.   Shop Shield offers three pricing plans: a scaled-back service that's free if payments to merchants are tied to a checking account; one that charges $2 each time you use a credit card and small fees for other features; and an unlimited, full-service plan for $10 a month or $99 a year. Kemesa also profits from interchange fees that credit card companies collect on purchases.   Shop Shield is ''a phenomenal concept,'' said Jay Foley, co-founder of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. He brought up the case of theft involving a DSW Shoe Warehouse database in 2005, in which hackers obtained 1.4 million credit card numbers and the names on those accounts. ''Imagine if with DSW, all the data that they had was from Shop Shield: one-time-use credit card numbers, no home addresses, no phone numbers.''   The chief executive of Kemesa, Steve Bachenheimer, would agree. ''Thieves can't steal what isn't there,'' he said. "
Computer Worm Called Conficker,"Computer Worm Called Conficker   The Conficker worm is scheduled to activate on April 1, and the unanswered question is: Will it prove to be the world's biggest April Fool's joke or is it the information age equivalent of Herman Kahn's visionary 1962 treatise about nuclear war, ''Thinking About the Unthinkable''?    Conficker is a program that is spread by exploiting several weaknesses in Microsoft's Windows operating system. Various versions of the software have spread widely around the globe since October, mostly outside the United States because there are more computers overseas running unpatched, pirated Windows. (The program does not infect Macintosh or Linux-based computers.)   An estimated 12 million or more machines have been infected. However, many have also been disinfected, so a precise census is difficult.   Speculation about Conficker's purpose ranges from the benign -- an April Fool's Day prank -- to far darker notions. One likely possibility is that the program will be used in the ''rent a computer crook'' business, something that has been tried previously by the computer underground. Just as Amazon.com offers computing time on its network for rent, the Conficker team might rent access to its ''network'' for nefarious purposes like spamming.   Or perhaps the Conficker botnet's masters have something more Machiavellian in mind. One researcher, Stefan Savage, a computer scientist at the University of California, San Diego, has suggested the idea of a ''Dark Google.'' What if Conficker is intended to give the computer underworld the ability to search for data on all the infected computers around the globe and then sell the answers? Malware already does this on a focused basis using a variety of schemes that are referred to as ''spear phishing,'' in a reference to the widespread use of social engineering tricks on the Net.   But to do something like that on a huge scale? That would be a dragnet -- and a genuine horror story. JOHN MARKOFF   COMMENTSounds like people better back up all their important files ASAP and then be prepared to reformat their computers. In reality, everyone should already be doing that on a regular basis. Have an external hard drive, or burn DVDs, or both! Splashy, March 20 "
VAST SPY SYSTEM LOOTS COMPUTERS IN 103 COUNTRIES,"A vast electronic spying operation has infiltrated computers and has stolen documents from hundreds of government and private offices around the world, including those of the Dalai Lama, Canadian researchers have concluded.   In a report to be issued this weekend, the researchers said that the system was being controlled from computers based almost exclusively in China, but that they could not say conclusively that the Chinese government was involved.    The researchers, who are based at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto, had been asked by the office of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader whom China regularly denounces, to examine its computers for signs of malicious software, or malware.    Their sleuthing opened a window into a broader operation that, in less than two years, has infiltrated at least 1,295 computers in 103 countries, including many belonging to embassies, foreign ministries and other government offices, as well as the Dalai Lama's Tibetan exile centers in India, Brussels, London and New York.     The researchers, who have a record of detecting computer espionage, said they believed that in addition to the spying on the Dalai Lama, the system, which they called GhostNet, was focused on the governments of South Asian and Southeast Asian countries.    Intelligence analysts say many governments, including those of China, Russia and the United States, and other parties use sophisticated computer programs to covertly gather information.    The newly reported spying operation is by far the largest to come to light in terms of countries affected.    This is also believed to be the first time researchers have been able to expose the workings of a computer system used in an intrusion of this magnitude.    Still going strong, the operation continues to invade and monitor more than a dozen new computers a week, the researchers said in their report, ''Tracking 'GhostNet': Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network.'' They said they had found no evidence that United States government offices had been infiltrated, although a NATO computer was monitored by the spies for half a day and computers of the Indian Embassy in Washington were infiltrated.   The malware is remarkable both for its sweep -- in computer jargon, it has not been merely ''phishing'' for random consumers' information, but ''whaling'' for particular important targets -- and for its Big Brother-style capacities. It can, for example, turn on the camera and audio-recording functions of an infected computer, enabling monitors to see and hear what goes on in a room. The investigators say they do not know if this facet has been employed.    The researchers were able to monitor the commands given to infected computers and to see the names of documents retrieved by the spies, but in most cases the contents of the stolen files have not been determined. Working with the Tibetans, however, the researchers found that specific correspondence had been stolen and that the intruders had gained control of the electronic mail server computers of the Dalai Lama's organization.    The electronic spy game has had at least some real-world impact, they said. For example, they said, after an e-mail invitation was sent by the Dalai Lama's office to a foreign diplomat, the Chinese government made a call to the diplomat discouraging a visit. And a  woman working for a group making Internet contacts between Tibetan exiles and Chinese citizens was stopped by Chinese intelligence officers on her way back to Tibet, shown transcripts of her  online conversations and warned to stop her political activities.    The Toronto researchers said they had notified international law enforcement agencies of the spying operation, which in their view exposed basic shortcomings in the legal structure of cyberspace. The F.B.I. declined to comment on the operation.    Although the Canadian researchers said that most of the computers behind the spying were in China, they cautioned against concluding that  China's government was involved. The spying could be a nonstate, for-profit operation, for example, or one run by private citizens in China known as ''patriotic hackers.''    ''We're a bit more careful about it, knowing the nuance of what happens in the subterranean realms,'' said Ronald J. Deibert, a member of the research group and an associate professor of political science at Munk. ''This could well be the C.I.A. or the Russians. It's a murky realm that we're lifting the lid on.''    A spokesman for the Chinese Consulate in New York dismissed the idea that China was involved. ''These are old stories and they are nonsense,'' the spokesman, Wenqi Gao, said. ''The Chinese government is opposed to and strictly forbids any cybercrime.''    The Toronto researchers, who allowed a reporter for The New York Times to review the spies' digital tracks, are publishing their findings in Information Warfare Monitor, an online publication associated with the Munk Center.    At the same time, two computer researchers at Cambridge University in Britain who worked on the part of the investigation related to the Tibetans, are releasing an independent report. They do fault China, and they warned that other hackers could adopt the tactics used in the malware operation.    ''What Chinese spooks did in 2008, Russian crooks will do in 2010 and even low-budget criminals from less developed countries will follow in due course,'' the Cambridge researchers, Shishir Nagaraja and Ross Anderson, wrote in their report, ''The Snooping Dragon: Social Malware Surveillance of the Tibetan Movement.''   In any case, it was suspicions of Chinese interference that led to the discovery of the spy operation. Last summer, the office of the Dalai Lama invited two specialists to India to audit computers used by the Dalai Lama's organization. The specialists, Greg Walton, the editor of Information Warfare Monitor, and Mr. Nagaraja, a network security expert, found that the computers had indeed been infected and that intruders had stolen files from personal computers serving several Tibetan exile groups.    Back in Toronto, Mr. Walton shared data with colleagues at the Munk Center's computer lab.    One of them was Nart Villeneuve, 34, a graduate student and self-taught ''white hat'' hacker with dazzling technical skills. Last year, Mr. Villeneuve linked the Chinese version of the Skype communications service to a Chinese government operation that was systematically eavesdropping on users' instant-messaging sessions.    Early this month, Mr. Villeneuve noticed an odd string of 22 characters embedded in files created by the malicious software and searched for it with Google. It led him to a group of computers on Hainan Island, off China, and to a Web site that would prove to be critically important.    In a puzzling security lapse, the Web page that Mr. Villeneuve found was not protected by a password, while much of the rest of the system uses encryption.    Mr. Villeneuve and his colleagues figured out how the operation worked by commanding it to infect a system in their  computer lab in Toronto. On  March 12, the spies took their own bait. Mr. Villeneuve watched a brief series of commands flicker on his computer screen as someone -- presumably in China -- rummaged through the files. Finding nothing of interest, the intruder soon disappeared.    Through trial and error, the researchers learned to use the system's Chinese-language ''dashboard'' -- a control panel reachable with a standard Web browser -- by which one could manipulate the more than 1,200 computers worldwide that had by then been infected.    Infection happens two ways. In one method, a user's clicking on a document attached to an e-mail message lets the system covertly install software deep in the target operating system. Alternatively, a user clicks on a Web link in an e-mail message and is taken directly to a ''poisoned'' Web site.    The researchers said they avoided breaking any laws during three weeks of monitoring and extensively experimenting with the system's unprotected software control panel. They provided, among other information, a log of compromised computers dating to May 22, 2007.      They found that three of the four control servers were in different provinces in China -- Hainan, Guangdong and Sichuan -- while the fourth was discovered to be at a Web-hosting company based in Southern California.     Beyond that, said Rafal A. Rohozinski, one of the investigators, ''attribution is difficult because there is no agreed upon international legal framework for being able to pursue investigations down to their logical conclusion, which is highly local.''

Five More Accused in Credit Card Fraud Investigation,"The five men operated thousands of miles from Manhattan, under aliases like ''the Viver,'' ''Inexwor'' and ''DoZ.'' And with their true identities obscured on the Web, Manhattan prosecutors said, these men were able to play intimate roles in a cybertheft that resulted in more than 95,000 stolen credit card numbers and $4 million worth of fraudulent transactions.    The men, all from Eastern Europe, were the latest suspects to be identified by Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, in a 17-defendant, 173-count enterprise corruption indictment dating to November 2007.    Mr. Morgenthau said at a news conference on Monday that the men were involved in a vast conspiracy known as the Western Express Cybercrime Group, which trafficked in stolen credit card information through the Internet and used it for things like forging credit cards and selling goods on eBay. The defendants often hid their identities by using digital currencies like e-gold and Webmoney, Mr. Morgenthau said.   ''The amazing thing is these guys in Eastern Europe can take advantage of people here in New York,'' he said.   Each of the  men -- Viatcheslav Vasilyev, Vladimir Kramarenko, Egor Shevelev, Dzimitry Burak and Oleg Kovelin -- was charged with enterprise corruption, punishable by up to 25 years in prison. They all face various lesser charges as well.   Mr. Vasilyev, 33, and Mr. Kramarenko, 31, who were both arrested last year at their homes in Prague, have been extradited to Manhattan, prosecutors said. They were scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday in State Supreme Court.   Frederica L. Miller, a lawyer for Mr. Vasilyev, said her client owned a legitimate Web design studio in Prague and planned to plead not guilty. ''He had absolutely no intent to commit fraud, steal property, and he had no need to launder any money,'' she said.   James Roth, who represents Mr. Kramarenko, said he believed the enterprise corruption charge would not hold up. ''We're going to vigorously contest the charges,'' he said.   Mr. Shevelev, 23, who was arrested in Greece last year, was still awaiting extradition, prosecutors said.   Mr. Burak, 26, and Mr. Kovelin, 28, had not yet been arrested, prosecutors said. Mr. Burak is a citizen of Belarus, according to the authorities, and his last known address was in Ukraine. Mr. Kovelin is a citizen of Moldova,  the authorities said.   A sixth defendant remained unidentified and at large, prosecutors said. Of the 14 people who had already been arrested under the indictment, five have pleaded guilty, prosecutors said.   The investigation leading to the indictments was a four-year joint operation between the Manhattan district attorney's office and the Secret Service.   In addition to the 17 people, a company in Manhattan, Western Express International Inc., also was indicted, accused of helping to move the money obtained through illegal credit card frauds.   Prosecutors said that Mr. Vasilyev and Mr. Kramarenko collaborated on an elaborate eBay scheme in which they would recruit people to advertise items, like cameras and other electronics. When someone would purchase an item, the prosecutors said, the two men would pocket the buyer's payment (and give a cut to their recruit), then use a stolen credit card number to purchase the item from a retail store and send it to the buyer.   Mr. Burak and Mr. Shevelev both sold stolen credit card information via the Internet, according to the authorities. Prosecutors said that Mr. Burak ran a Web site, Dumpsmarket, as a networking center for trafficking stolen personal information.   Mr. Kovelin, prosecutors said, was a hacker who tapped into people's online financial accounts and sent fraudulent e-mail messages to try to induce people to disclose their personal information. "
Online Attack Silences Twitter for Much of Day,"Twitter, the popular microblogging site, was out of service much of the day Thursday as it worked to defend itself against a  Web attack, but service appeared to have been restored by late evening.    Many of Twitter's 45 million legitimate visitors were unable to use the service for hours. Analysts characterized the disruption as a denial-of-service attack, in which hackers overwhelm a Web site by sending it a deluge of junk requests, and one suggested the attack might have originated in Russia or Georgia.    Facebook and Google fended off similar attacks on Thursday.    Most computer security analysts did not cite a specific source of the attack on Twitter.    But Bill Woodcock, research director of the Packet Clearing House, a nonprofit technical organization that tracks Internet traffic, said the attack was an extension of the conflict between Russia and Georgia.   It was not clear who initiated the attack, Mr. Woodcock said, but it was likely that ''one side put up propaganda, the other side figured this out and is attacking them.'' He said he found evidence that the attacks had originated from the Abkhazia region, a territory on the Black Sea disputed between Russia and Georgia.    Mr. Woodcock said the disruptions did not appear to have been caused by a botnet, or network of thousands of malware-infected personal computers.    Rather, he said, at about 10:30 a.m. E.S.T., millions of people worldwide received spam e-mail messages containing links to Twitter and other sites. When recipients clicked on the links, those sites were overwhelmed with requests to access their servers. ''It's a vast increase in traffic that creates the denial of service,'' he said.    Although YouTube and LiveJournal.com were also affected, Mr. Woodcock said, ''Twitter was definitely hit the hardest.'' YouTube said it had not noticed any problems with its service.    In a blog posting late Thursday morning, Biz Stone, a founder of Twitter, addressed the disruption, saying, ''We are defending against this attack now and will continue to update our status blog as we continue to defend and later investigate.''    Twitter was still working to restore service to all its users late on Thursday.    ''It's unusual to see an attack on a site lasting that long,'' Stefan Tanase, a malware researcher at the  technology security firm Kaspersky Lab, said. ''Generally there are procedures in place in case of such an attack, but unfortunately Twitter has a long history of security-related issues, and this really shows that they are not very mature in this area yet.''   Facebook also experienced a failure, but it was not clear whether the disturbance was related to the attack on Twitter.   ''Earlier this morning, Facebook encountered network issues related to an apparent distributed denial-of-service attack that resulted in degraded service for some users,'' the company said in a statement.    ''No user data was at risk, and we have restored full access to the site for most users,'' the company said. ''We're continuing to monitor the situation to ensure that users have the fast and reliable experience they've come to expect from Facebook.''   Disruptions like the one at Twitter are increasingly rare, said Graham Cluley, an analyst with the Internet security firm Sophos. ''Most of the really big Web sites are pretty well protected against these things,'' Mr. Cluley said.   ''Maybe Twitter, which has shown astronomical growth and has been phenomenally successful, hasn't had the time to mature enough to prepare,'' he said.   Google said on Thursday afternoon that its ''systems prevented substantive impact to our services.''   As recently as a year ago, service interruptions on Twitter were common enough that the graphic of a whale being carried by a flock of birds -- used to signal that service was down -- was nicknamed Fail Whale by users.   But Twitter has done much better in recent months, said Peter Alguacil, an analyst with Pingdom, a service that monitors the downtime of Web sites, including Twitter. ''This is by far the biggest problem they've had all 2009,'' he said. ''You'll have to go back over a year to find anything similar.''   Concern over the service disruption underscores the role Twitter has come to play in everyday communications. Businesses and individuals use the service to communicate using 140-character messages, known to users as tweets.    It also played a role as an unfiltered source of information in political protests after the recent Iranian elections.   ''Big companies are reliant on Twitter for marketing and consumer outreach,'' Mr. Cluley said. ''People feel a very real pang when a site like this goes down.'' "
Gates Faults U.S. on Data Privacy and Immigration,"In a far-ranging speech on Friday, Bill Gates criticized the American government's policy on immigration and data privacy, predicted giant leaps in technology in the near future and explained why he had to shut down his Facebook page.    ''Over the next decade, the entire way we interact'' with computers will change, Mr. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, told hundreds of government officials and information technology executives in New Delhi. Mr. Gates spoke of cellphones that would recognize people around them or be used to test for diseases, computers equipped with voice recognition and an Internet that was used for much more than Web pages.     While the recession has been a ''big deal,'' it has not slowed innovation, he said, in part because countries like India and companies like Microsoft are investing in education and research for a new generation of computer scientists.    Microsoft is angling to work on India's national identity card project, Mr. Gates said, and he will be meeting with Nandan Nilekani, the minister in charge. Like Mr. Gates, Mr. Nilekani stopped running the technology company he helped to start, Infosys, after expanding it into one of the biggest players in the business. He is now tasked with providing identity cards for India's 1.2 billion citizens starting in 2011. Right now in India, many records like births, deaths, immunizations and driving violations are kept on paper in local offices.    Mr. Gates was also critical of the United States government's unwillingness to adopt a national identity card, or allow some businesses, like health care, to centralize data-keeping on individuals.    ''It has always come back to the idea that 'The computer knows too much about you,' '' he said.    The United States ''got off to a bad start'' when it comes to using computers to keep data about its citizens, he said.  Doctors are not allowed to share records about an individual patient, and virtual doctor visits are banned, he said, which ''wastes a lot of money.'' The United States ''had better come up with a better model'' for health care, he said.    He was also critical of  Congress's stance on immigration, and said he would like to see immigration exceptions for ''smart people.'' Canadian laws are more favorable, he said, because they allow immigrants to work if they are offered a high-paying  job. Microsoft has created ''a lot of jobs in Canada for that reason,'' he said.    Asked whether he ever ''unplugs,'' abandoning e-mail messages, computers and his cellphone entirely, Mr. Gates laughed and said ''I'm not a 24-hour technology person.'' He said he read a lot ''and sometimes not on a screen.'' He added that he was not big on text messaging. ''All these tools of technology let us waste our time if we're not careful,'' he said.    Mr. Gates said the buzzwords ''social networking'' applied to something that had been around for a long time  --  a way to communicate with numerous people at the same time.   He acknowledged that he once had a Facebook page, but every day ''ten thousand people tried to be my friend.'' He said he spent too much time trying to decide ''Do I know them? Don't I know them?'' Ultimately, he said, ''I had to give it up.''  "
Germany Looks at Ways to Protect Online Journalism,"As Angela Merkel begins her second term as chancellor of Germany, her government is promoting a novel way to help embattled newspaper and magazine publishers manage the transition to a digital future.   The new governing coalition, led by Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats and including the Free Democratic Party, has pledged to create a new kind of copyright to protect online journalism. The goal is to level the playing field with Internet companies like Google, which German publishers accuse of exploiting their content to build lucrative businesses without sharing the rewards.   ''The Internet cannot be a copyright-free zone,'' the coalition says in a document setting out its policies.    Supporters of the proposal include Hubert Burda Media, a magazine publisher, and Axel Springer, owner of the newspapers Bild and Die Welt, who say it could be employed to help build new online business models. Analysts say it might allow them to try to claim royalties for the use of their content by Google or other online ''aggregators'' of news, for example.   But the plan is raising hackles on the Internet, where opponents say an extension of copyright law runs counter to the spirit of openness that characterizes the Web. The government, they say, has succumbed to lobbying by big publishing interests that are fighting a rear-guard action against technological changes.   The proposal ''has no value for our society,'' said Markus Beckedahl, a blogger based in Berlin and advocate of an unfettered Internet. ''It only has value for publishers who see a threat from the democratization of the media.   ''This debate is happening only because German publishers have failed to build successful business models on the Internet,'' he said.   State intervention in the media is a sensitive topic in Germany because of memories of the Nazis' control of the press during the Third Reich. Direct financial subsidies, which keep some newspapers alive in France and other European countries, would be out of the question, German publishers say.   Amid concerns about privacy and access to information, the new government has rejected one copyright-enforcement approach embraced in France and Britain: cutting off the Internet access of persistent pirates of online music and movies. Ms. Merkel's coalition instead calls for greater cooperation between rights holders and Internet service providers to try to solve the piracy problem.    But her government has endorsed a more aggressive approach to the challenges facing the news media. As in other countries, meager revenue from newspaper Web sites shows no sign of compensating for losses from falling ad sales and declining readership of print editions.   ''Freedom of information is important,'' said Burkhard Schaffeld, corporate counsel for the German Newspaper Publishers Association. ''But quality journalism costs money. There is no fundamental right to information for free on the Internet.''   The government's proposal, championed by Culture Minister Bernd Neumann, would give publishers a so-called neighboring right, something that music labels and movie houses already enjoy.   Details of how the proposal would work have not been spelled out, but publishing executives say one possibility would be to require a license for any commercial use of published material online. That might include Web sites that post articles from other sources, assuming they sell advertising.    A new agency, modeled on the music and book industries' royalty collection societies, could be created to gather and distribute the fees, publishing executives add.   Private, noncommercial use of news articles would remain unrestricted under the proposals publishers are discussing.   Opponents of the plans say the distinction between commercial and private use would be difficult to define, making enforcement of the plan a challenge. Many bloggers, for example, sell advertising and have commercial ambitions, while others blog chiefly for their own gratification, even if their comments are available for all the world to read. Would they have to pay for borrowing from online newspapers content?   Even Google, a highly commercial company that generates the vast majority of its revenue from advertising, does not sell ads on its European Google News sites, which collect blurbs from news articles and provide links to the sites from which they originated. Google did not reply to a request for comment.   The company has also faced objections to its news service from publishers elsewhere in Europe. Newspapers in Belgium, for instance, have been involved in a long legal battle to win damages from the company, after suing to get it to remove links to their content on Google News.   Publishers say it is not clear when legislation to implement the German government's proposal might be introduced. Publishers are still negotiating with journalists' unions on a plan to present to the government, and not all journalists are in favor of the idea.   ''Copyright must not be misused as a lever to protect outdated distribution methods and to secure new business and licensing models,'' a group of prominent journalists wrote in an ''Internet manifesto'' that appeared this summer, after publishers proposed the new copyright.    Publishers say they understand that the Internet is different, but that they are tired of watching others make money from their content online. ''This is simply one part of the media's effort to survive in a new kind of economy,'' said Stefan Soder, a lawyer for Hubert Burda Media, a magazine publisher based in Munich. ''Obviously everyone wants access to free and unlimited information, but if everyone has that, then there is no way to pay for the production of it.'' "
Tracking Cyberspies Through the Web Wilderness,"For old-fashioned detectives, the problem was always acquiring information. For the cybersleuth, hunting evidence in the data tangle of the Internet, the problem is different.    ''The holy grail is how can you distinguish between information which is garbage and information which is valuable?'' said Rafal Rohozinski, a University of Cambridge-trained social scientist  involved in computer security issues.    Beginning eight years ago he co-founded two groups, Information Warfare Monitor and Citizen Lab, which  both have headquarters at the University of Toronto, with Ronald Deibert, a University of Toronto political scientist. The groups pursue that grail and strive to put investigative tools normally reserved for law enforcement agencies and computer security investigators at the service of groups that do not have such resources.   ''We thought that civil society groups lacked an intelligence capacity,'' Dr. Deibert said.    They have had some important successes. Last year Nart Villeneuve, 34, an international relations researcher who works for the two groups, found that a Chinese version of Skype software was being used for eavesdropping by one of China's major wireless carriers, probably on behalf of Chinese government law enforcement agencies.   This year, he helped uncover a spy system, which he and his fellow researchers dubbed Ghostnet, which looked like a  Chinese-government-run spying operation on mostly South Asian government-owned computers  around the world.   Both discoveries were the result of a new genre of detective work, and they illustrate the strengths and  the limits of detective work in cyberspace.    The Ghostnet case began when  Greg Walton, the editor of Infowar Monitor and a member of the research team, was invited to audit the Dalai Lama's office network in Dharamsala, India. Under constant attack -- possibly from Chinese-government-sponsored computer hackers -- the exiles had turned to the Canadian researchers to help combat the digital spies that had been planted in their communications system over several years.   Both at the Dalai Lama's private office and at the headquarters of the exiled Tibetan government, Mr. Walton used a powerful software program known as Wireshark to capture the Internet traffic  to and from the exile groups' computers.   Wireshark is an open-source software program that is freely available to computer security investigators. It is distinguished by its ease of use and by its ability to sort out and decode hundreds of common Internet protocols  that are used for different types of data communications. It is known as a sniffer, and such software programs are essential for the sleuths who track cybercriminals and spies on the Internet.    Wireshark makes it possible to watch an unencrypted Internet chat session while it is taking place, or in the case of Mr. Walton's research in India, to watch as Internet attackers copied files from the Dalai Lama's network.    In almost every case, when the Ghostnet system administrators took over a remote computer they would install a clandestine Chinese-designed software program called GhOst RAT  --  for Remote Administration Terminal. GhOst RAT permits the control of a distant computer via the Internet, to the extent of being able to turn on audio and video recording features and capture the resulting files. The operators of the system  --  whoever they were  --  in addition to stealing digital files and e-mail messages, could transform office PCs into remote listening posts.    The spying  was of immediate concern to the Tibetans, because the documents that were being stolen were related to negotiating positions the Dalai Lama's political representatives were planning to take in negotiations the group was engaged in.   After returning to Canada, Mr. Walton shared his captured data with Mr. Villeneuve and the two  used a second tool to analyze the information. They uploaded the data into a visualization program that had been provided to the group by Palantir Technologies, a software company that has developed a program that allows investigators to ''fuse'' large data sets to look for correlations and connections that may otherwise go unnoticed.    The company was founded several years ago by a group of technologists who had pioneered fraud detection techniques at Paypal, the Silicon Valley online payment company. Palantir has developed a pattern recognition tool that is used both by intelligence agencies and financial services companies, and the Citizen Lab researchers have modified it by adding capabilities that are specific to Internet data.    Mr. Villeneuve was using this software  to view these data files  in a basement at the University of Toronto  when he noticed a seemingly innocuous but puzzling string of 22 characters reappearing in different files. On a hunch, he entered the string into Google's search engine and was instantly directed to similar files stored on a vast computerized surveillance system located on Hainan Island off the coast of China. The Tibetan files were being copied to these computers.    But the researchers were not able to determine with certainty who controlled the system. The system could have been created by so-called patriotic hackers, independent computer activists in China whose actions are closely aligned with, but independent from, the Chinese government. Or it could have been created and run by Internet spies  in a third country.    Indeed, the discovery raised as many questions as it answered. Why was the powerful eavesdropping system not password-protected, a weakness that made it easy for Mr. Villeneuve to determine how the system worked? And why among the more than 1,200 compromised government computers representing 103 countries, were there no United States government systems? These questions remain.   Cyberforensics presents immense technical challenges that are complicated by the fact that the Internet effortlessly spans both local and national government boundaries. It is possible for a criminal, for example, to conceal his or her activities by connecting to a target computer through a string of innocent computers, each connected to the Internet on different continents, making law enforcement investigations time consuming or even impossible.   The most vexing issue facing both law enforcement and other cyberspace investigators is this  question of  ''attribution.'' The famous New Yorker magazine cartoon in which a dog sits at a computer keyboard and points out to a companion,  ''on the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog,'' is no joke for cyberdetectives.   To deal with the  challenge, the Toronto researchers are pursuing what they describe as a fusion methodology, in which they look at Internet data in the context of real world events.   ''We had a really good hunch that in order to understand what was going on in cyberspace we needed to collect two completely different sets of data,'' Mr. Rohozinski said. ''On one hand we needed technical data generated from Internet log files. The other component is trying to understand what is going on in cyberspace by interviewing people, and by understanding how institutions work.''    Veteran cybersecurity investigators agree that the best data detectives need to go beyond the Internet. They may even need to wear out some shoe leather.    ''We can't become myopic about our tools,'' said Kent Anderson, a security investigator who is a member of security management committee of the Information Systems Audit and Control Association. ''I continually bump up against good technologists who know how to use tools, but who don't understand how their tools fit into the bigger picture of the investigation.'' "
PENTAGON PLANS NEW ARM TO WAGE COMPUTER WARS,"The Pentagon plans to create a new military command for cyberspace, administration officials said Thursday, stepping up preparations by the armed forces to conduct both offensive and defensive computer warfare.   The military command would complement a civilian effort to be announced by President Obama on Friday that would overhaul the way the United States safeguards its computer networks.   Mr. Obama, officials said, will announce the creation of a White House office -- reporting to both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council -- that will coordinate a multibillion-dollar effort to restrict access to government computers and protect systems that run the stock exchanges, clear global banking transactions and manage the air traffic control system.    White House officials say Mr. Obama has not yet been formally presented with the Pentagon plan. They said he would not discuss it Friday when he announced the creation of a White House office responsible for coordinating private-sector and government defenses against the thousands of cyberattacks mounted against the United States -- largely by hackers but sometimes by foreign governments -- every day.    But he is expected to sign a classified order in coming weeks that will create the military cybercommand, officials said. It is a recognition that the United States already has a growing number of computer weapons in its arsenal and must prepare strategies for their use -- as a deterrent or alongside conventional weapons  -- in a wide variety of possible future conflicts.    The White House office will be run by a ''cyberczar,'' but because the position will not have direct access to the president, some experts said it was not high-level enough to end a series of bureaucratic wars that have broken out as billions of dollars have suddenly been allocated to protect against the computer threats.    The main dispute has been over whether the Pentagon or the National Security Agency should take the lead in preparing for and fighting cyberbattles. Under one proposal still being debated, parts of the N.S.A. would be integrated into the military command so they could operate jointly.    Officials said that in addition to the unclassified strategy paper to be released by Mr. Obama on Friday, a classified set of presidential directives is expected to lay out the military's new responsibilities and how it coordinates its mission with that of the N.S.A., where most of the expertise on digital warfare resides today.   The decision to create a cybercommand is a major step beyond the actions taken by the Bush administration, which authorized several computer-based attacks but never resolved the question of how the government would prepare for a new era of warfare fought over digital networks.    It is still unclear whether the military's new command or the N.S.A. -- or both -- will actually conduct this new kind of offensive cyberoperations.    The White House has never said whether Mr. Obama embraces the idea that the United States should use cyberweapons, and the public announcement on Friday is expected to focus solely on defensive steps and the government's acknowledgment that it needs to be better organized to face the threat from foes attacking military, government and commercial online systems.    Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has pushed for the Pentagon to become better organized to address the security threat.    Initially at least, the new command would focus on organizing the various components and capabilities now scattered across the four armed services.    Officials declined to describe potential offensive operations, but said they now viewed cyberspace as comparable to more traditional battlefields.    ''We are not comfortable discussing the question of offensive cyberoperations, but we consider cyberspace a war-fighting domain,'' said Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman. ''We need to be able to operate within that domain just like on any battlefield, which includes protecting our freedom of movement and preserving our capability to perform in that environment.''    Although Pentagon civilian officials and military officers said the new command was expected to initially be a subordinate headquarters under the military's Strategic Command, which controls nuclear operations as well as cyberdefenses, it could eventually become an independent command.   ''No decision has been made,'' said Lt. Col. Eric Butterbaugh, a Pentagon spokesman. ''Just as the White House has completed its 60-day review of cyberspace policy, likewise, we are looking at how the department can best organize itself to fill our role in implementing the administration's cyberpolicy.''   The creation of the cyberczar's office inside the White House appears to be part of a significant expansion of the role of the national security apparatus there. A separate group overseeing domestic security, created by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks, now resides within the National Security Council. A senior White House official responsible for countering the proliferation of nuclear and unconventional weapons has been given broader authority. Now, cybersecurity will also rank as one of the key threats that Mr. Obama is seeking to coordinate from the White House.    The strategy review Mr. Obama will discuss on Friday was completed weeks ago, but delayed because of continuing arguments over the authority of the White House office, and the budgets for the entire effort.    It was kept separate from the military debate over whether the Pentagon or the N.S.A. is best equipped to engage in offensive operations. Part of that debate hinges on the question of how much control should be given to American spy agencies, since they are prohibited from acting on American soil.   ''It's the domestic spying problem writ large,'' one senior intelligence official said recently. ''These attacks start in other countries, but they know no borders. So how do you fight them if you can't act both inside and outside the United States?''  "
Malicious Software Is Revised,"The riddle of a malicious software program that has spread throughout the Internet deepened Thursday as security researchers examined a new version of the software that they said made it more difficult to eradicate the program.    The program, known as Conficker, targets versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system and has now been distributed in four versions, computer security specialists said.   Several of the groups monitoring the program said the most recent version, which began to appear Tuesday, appeared to be targeted at improving a peer-to-peer communications system between computers that are infected and hardening the system by making infected machines more resistant to anti-virus software.    Several researchers also said there might be a connection between the authors of Conficker and of another program known as Waladec, a malware program that has been used to distribute fraudulent advertisements through e-mail spam. They also noted that the Conficker authors have switched strategies and are using the program's peer-to-peer mechanism to update the system. Originally, they had appeared to plan to download instructions to Conficker by generating new Internet addresses that infected machines could download instructions from.    An earlier version of the program had been set to begin contacting servers on April 1, raising widespread concern about the authors' intent. Now, however, the system for programming Conficker uses a peer-to-peer mechanism that can be initiated from any one of millions of infected systems.   The consensus within the computer security industry is that although there are now some indications that Conficker's authors are intent on building a giant spam system, there is no hard evidence.   ''This is just Step 5 in a thousand-step chess match,'' said Vincent Weafer, vice president of the security response division at Symantec. "
Hackers Latch On to Excitement Surrounding Latest Potter Film,"Some Internet bad guys are exploiting interest in the new Harry Potter movie to further their devious plot to make mischief online.    Their target is people who can be enticed to watch an illegal copy of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' on the Web. PC Tools, a security company bought by Symantec last year, described the attack Thursday on its ThreatFire blog. The company says the bad guys are populating sites like Digg.com and Blogspot and sending spam e-mail with enticements to ''Watch 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' online free'' and links to a bogus film site. They are also flooding the comment sections of these sites with various Harry Potter keywords, to try to trick search engines into displaying their site in search results.   Click on the bogus film site, PC Tools reports, and the victim's computer is visited by a rotating selection of malware, including the koobface worm.   ''This is headline malware,'' said Mike Greene, vice president for product strategy at PC Tools. ''When Michael Jackson passed away we saw a surge around that. Whenever you see a headline, you can be pretty confident you will find some hot malware.''    COMMENTSocial Darwinism is dead. Technological Darwinism is very much alive.

Hacker Pleads Guilty in Vast Theft of Card Numbers,"BOSTON (Reuters) -- A 28-year-old computer hacker pleaded guilty to some of the largest identity-theft crimes on record Friday and left a federal judge struggling with how to compensate his millions of victims.    Court papers filed last month had already shown Albert Gonzalez of Miami would plead guilty to federal charges in Massachusetts and New York that he helped lead a worldwide ring that stole more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers from major retail chains, including TJX, the parent of T. J. Maxx and Marshalls.   He faces similar charges in New Jersey.   In his first public appearance since the plea deal was filed, Mr. Gonzalez appeared much humbler than he did in the same courtroom a year ago after his arrest in the New York case. In the interim he trimmed off most of his long hair. He spent Friday's hearing seated at a side table wearing tan prison clothes and giving only short answers as Judge Patti B. Saris reviewed the 20 charges to which he pleaded guilty.   Mr. Gonzalez faces up to 25 years in prison as part of a plea deal, which would be among the stiffest prosecutors could recall for such a crime. Judge Saris set a sentencing date in December, but first intends to review how authorities might compensate his victims, including the retailers, banks that issued payment cards and millions of individuals.   Authorities confiscated cash, computers, a condominium and a handgun from Mr. Gonzalez, together worth more than $1.6 million, but his lawyers and prosecutors agreed those assets would be modest compared with  the damages he caused his victims.   ''I have a sinking sensation that the number of victims may exceed the available recovery,'' Judge Saris said in court.   Mr. Gonzalez was quickly led away in handcuffs after the hearing and will be held at a federal facility in Rhode Island. His lawyer, Rene Palomino, said afterward that Mr. Gonzalez was ''extremely remorseful for what he's done.''   Asked about his client's modest demeanor, Mr. Palomino said: ''Once you make the decision he made, you get a lot off your chest. Taking responsibility for your action is the first step to putting it behind you.''  "
Missing Photos on the BlackBerry,"Missing Photos    On the BlackBerry   Q.The text comes over fine, but some of my Outlook contact pictures won't copy over to my BlackBerry when I synchronize it with my PC. Any ideas as to why some photos sync up and some don't?   A. The Outlook contact photos that refuse to synchronize with the BlackBerry might be too large (more than 32 kilobytes) for the smartphone to handle -- or in an unsupported file format. If this seems to be the case, try resaving the problem photos as JPEG files at a resolution of 96 dots per inch, with a screen size of 90 pixels by 90 pixels.    Before you resize and resave a bunch of files at once, try this procedure on just one contact photo first to see if it fixes the problem. Import the new photo back into the Outlook contact and synchronize the BlackBerry with the PC to make sure the image shows up on the phone before you do the rest.   Tuning Up   A Second-Hand PC   Q. This Windows computer I inherited is agonizingly slow. It sounds like an air-conditioner running constantly (as though a program is running which uses all the power), and can take several minutes to go from page to page. How can I speed it up?   A. If the computer has outdated security software -- or none at all -- try installing some and running it to remove any  malicious software that could be hogging the computer's resources. Plenty of commercial suites are available, but you can also find free basic protection with programs like AVG Free Antivirus (free.avg.com), Avast Antivirus Home Edition (avast.com), Spybot Search & Destroy (safer-networking.org) and Microsoft's own free Windows Defender (microsoft.com/defender).   Once you have removed any hidden or malicious software from the PC, take a stroll through its Programs menu and uninstall any applications you do not use to free up some space on the hard drive. If a program doesn't have its own uninstaller program listed with it in the Programs menu, use the Add/Remove Programs control panel; Microsoft has a tutorial at tinyurl.com/m38dod.   While you are in the Programs menus, check the Startup folder for shortcuts to applications that fire themselves up when you start Windows. Remove the shortcuts to programs you don't use -- or don't want to start automatically. A more thorough (but more technical) way to control which programs start up with Windows is to use the System Configuration Utility; a detailed tutorial for it can be found at netsquirrel.com/msconfig.   Basic maintenance tasks like running the built-in Disk Cleanup and Disk Defragmenter tools can also help speed up your PC. You can find instructions at tinyurl.com/llby4p.   If the PC is still sluggish, it may need more memory. You can see how much memory is already installed by going to the Start menu to Control Panel, double-clicking on the System icon and clicking the General tab; the amount of random access memory (RAM) is listed. Memory dealers like Crucial (crucial.com) or Kingston (kingston.com) can guide you through buying the appropriate chips.

"Google to Offer Ads Based on Interests, With Privacy Rights","Google will begin showing ads on Wednesday to people based on their previous online activities in a form of advertising known as behavioral targeting, which has been embraced by most of its competitors but has drawn criticism from privacy advocates and some members of Congress.   Perhaps to forestall objections to its approach, Google said it planned to offer new ways for users to protect their privacy. Most notably, Google will be the first major company to give users the ability to see and edit the information that it has compiled about their interests for the purposes of behavioral targeting. Like rivals such as Yahoo, it also will give users the choice to opt out from what it calls ''interest-based advertising.''     Privacy advocates praised Google's decision to give users access to their profiles.    Given Google's position as the No. 1 seller of online ads, its approach is likely to put pressure on other companies to follow suit. Online advertising industry groups said it might help quell calls for government regulation.    But the privacy advocates also said Google needed to do more to notify people that they were being tracked.    ''We think more needs to be done on how to educate people and tell them how to opt out,'' said Ari Schwartz, chief operating officer of the Center for Democracy and Technology.    Google's foray into behavioral targeting may represent the most visible result so far of the company's integration of DoubleClick, an advertising technology company that it acquired a year ago. Google bought DoubleClick, which is used by advertisers and publishers to manage their ad campaigns, to extend its advertising empire into display ads, which it sees as the next best hope to reignite its growth.    Google will use a cookie, a small piece of text that resides inside a Web browser, to track users as they visit one of the hundreds of thousands of sites that show ads through its AdSense program. Google will assign those users to categories based on the content of the pages they visit. For example, a user may be pegged as a potential car buyer, sports enthusiast or expectant mother.    Google will then use that information to show people ads that are relevant to their interests, regardless of what sites they are visiting. An expectant mother may see an ad about baby products not only on a parenting site but also, for example, on a sports or fashion site that uses AdSense or on YouTube, which is owned by Google.    The program will first be tested with a few dozen advertisers but Google plans to expand it.    Google said the approach could help advertisers  reach their audiences more easily and publishers to earn more from their sites. Users will also see ads that are more relevant to their interests, the company said.    Google said that it planned to segment users along 20 categories and nearly 600 subcategories, and would not create categories for certain ''sensitive'' interests, including race, religion, sexual orientation or certain types of financial or health concerns. It does not plan to associate the cookie of users with search data or with information from other Google services, like Gmail.    Google won't notify users that it has begun to show them ads based on their behavior, but users who click on the ''Ads By Google'' link, which appears on thousands of Web pages, will be taken to a site where the technique is explained. There, they will also be able to tap into what Google calls the Ads Preferences Manager, to see and edit the ad categories that have been associated with their browser.    ''We had to find some way to open the box,'' said Nicole Wong, Google's deputy general counsel. ''Users don't know how many entities pick up data. They don't know what happens with it. And they don't know why Cole Haan shows me a given ad. And even if they did know, they can't control it.''   Mr. Schwartz said that Google's approach showed that claims by some advertising companies that giving users access to their profiles would be too onerous were not true.    Google's entry into behavioral targeting could complicate the company's relationship with Web publishers that use its advertising services. Many publishers are reluctant to hand over information about their users to Google if the company will in turn use it to help advertisers reach those users when they visit other sites. Most advertising networks already do this, but Google's broad reach makes publishers particularly nervous.   At the same time, if the behavioral targeting system lets publishers get higher-priced ads, they may find it too hard to resist.    ''This further extends the schizophrenic nature of the relationship between Google and publishers,'' said Rob Norman, chief executive of GroupM Interaction, a unit of ad giant WPP.    Google is allowing publishers  to opt out of the  program.  "
Google's Big Plan for Books,"While the Internet has transformed much of the information world, books have been a laggard. Google may change that. It has already scanned millions of out-of-print books, and it has reached an agreement with writers and publishers -- which still requires judicial approval -- to make them widely available.     Google's book service raises monopoly and privacy concerns. It also holds great promise for increasing access to knowledge. Much of the information in the world's books is not widely available. When Google began scanning out-of-print books held by major libraries its goal was to create an enormous database that Internet users could access from local libraries or homes.    Google fumbled, however, by scanning copyrighted works without the rights holders' permission. Writers and publishers sued, and the parties have now reached a settlement. A federal court in New York has scheduled a hearing this fall on the settlement, which could be hotly contested.   Google's effort could create new interest in millions of out-of-print books, which would be made available at no cost at public libraries. That means that a student at a community college or a freelance writer could access the same books as a Harvard professor.    At a time when publishing's economic model is threatened, there is also an important financial upside for authors and publishers. Google would charge users for accessing copyrighted books from their own computers and sell online ads, and it would give writers and publishers 63 percent of the revenue. The settlement would create a books rights registry to distribute payments.    Google's access to most books would not be exclusive since Microsoft or Joe's Online Library could cut their own deal with authors and publishers and scan books as well. However, it is likely that as a result of the settlement, Google would be the only company with the right to ''orphaned'' works, books whose rights owners have not been located.   If that were to happen, Google could use monopoly power to price these books exorbitantly. The court reviewing the settlement and the Department of Justice should make sure adequate protections are built in.   The proposed settlement also raises privacy concerns. Google could collect data on what books people read and create a dossier of their political views and other information. Google should generally do a better job of showing how it will respect privacy, and this venture is no exception.  "
City Errantly Releases Private Data Gathered in 'Apps' Contest,"On Tuesday, New York City rolled out the next phase of its NYC BigApps competition, an initiative that will supply local programmers and developers with a stockpile of raw municipal data sets to build applications for the Web and mobile phones.   But in what appears to have been an accidental data breach, the city provided, as part of one data set, private information from representatives of women's groups. A data file containing information on 1,100 such groups that had registered with the city's Commission on Women's Issues included fields for each participant's ''secret question'' and answer. (Participants had been asked for the question and answer to log in to the Women's Resource Network, a Web site organized by the commission.)     In a statement on Wednesday, the city's Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications acknowledged the lapse and said it had taken steps to rectify the situation. Nicholas T. Sbordone, a spokesman for the department, said in a statement: ''With an unprecedented amount of open city data comes an added level of responsibility to safeguard personal information, a charge the city -- and NYC BigApps administrators -- takes most seriously. We immediately addressed the issues with the two columns of data out of more than 170 data sets across 30 city agencies and commissions, and reviewed all other information to ensure no similar instances.''   Officials added that the city had immediately removed the data set from its site after learning about the breach and that there was no indication that anyone had tried to use the private information to log in to the Women's Resource Network.   Some people whose data was provided as part of the breach expressed dismay when contacted about the matter.    ''That's not too good,'' said Sheryl H. Fields, who learned that the maiden name of her deceased mother, Valerie Holland, was part of the data set released by the city. ''When you give a secret question, you don't expect it to get published.''    Ms. Fields had provided the information in her former position as president of the Brooklyn chapter of the International Association of Administrative Professionals. ''I'm not the contact person for them anymore,'' she added.   Although Ms. Fields's mother died three years ago, Ms. Fields said, ''It's private information.''   Another person whose data was released was Leah Shamalov, director of communications and special events for the Russian American Foundation. Ms. Shamalov's secret data  was the name of her dog, Smokey.    ''I'm not really that concerned,'' Ms. Shamalov said. ''It wasn't something like a top-secret Web site. If you came back and told me my credit card company had released my information, I would be more concerned.''   Ms. Shamalov added: ''Smokey died years ago. He was the only pet my family ever had.''    Angeline Martyn, the communications director for Americans for Unfpa, a group that supports women's rights and the United Nations Population Fund, learned that her secret question -- her boss's least-favorite color -- was no longer so secret.    ''I came up with that one because I knew everyone in the office would know the answer,'' Ms. Martyn said, adding, ''I'm glad the city has caught the error.'' "
Swiss Say Google's Street View Is Too Revealing,"Swiss officials said Friday that they had sued Google to try to require it to tighten privacy safeguards on its Street View online service. It is  the latest of a series of European objections to the company's handling of personal information.    The Swiss data protection authority said it had filed a complaint with the Federal Administrative Court after Google balked at its demand for additional measures to make obscure the images of people who appear in Street View, particularly in areas around hospitals, schools and prisons.   Street View provides ground-level panoramas of streets across the United States, Europe and other regions, searchable via Google's mapping service. Google compiles the scenes with camera-equipped cars.   Google already blurs the faces and license plates that appear in Street View. Users of the service can also request that certain images, like  their homes, be removed or blurred.   Google said it had met with the data protection commissioner, Hanspeter Thur, before the introduction of the Swiss version of Street View and received  ''the green light to launch the product'' in August. After the authorities raised objections, Google said it had offered other protective measures, but said the commissioner rejected them as inadequate.   ''We are disappointed that Herr Thur has changed his position on Street View after launch, and that he has not considered our proposals for further improvements to the product,'' Google said in a statement. ''We will vigorously defend Street View in court and we're committed to continue bringing the benefits of this product to Swiss users.''   The authority said it had never explicitly endorsed Google's safeguards. It also said the lawsuit followed complaints from more than 100 people.   Switzerland is one of several European countries, including Britain, Germany and Greece, in which Street View has prompted privacy objections. In Germany, the company has agreed to remove even the raw images it stores, not just the published pictures, of people who object to their inclusion.   In another privacy-related matter, Google and other search engines have reduced the period of time they store Web search data, under pressure from the European Commission.   Under Swiss law, which is known for its tradition of discretion, individuals have considerable control over the use of their images, the privacy agency maintains. "
Privacy in a Wired World,"To the Editor:   Re ''That Climate Change E-Mail'' (editorial, Dec. 6):    Equally important to the controversy over climate change prompted by e-mail messages that questioned the scientific validity of global warming are the security and privacy issues that challenge a society becoming dependent on text messages, tweets, Facebook and e-mail messages.    We rely on a reasonable level of privacy in our communication, yet in addition to security breaches, confidentiality is undermined by the agreements we sign with service providers, the information we share with e-commerce sites, our community of correspondents who forward our messages and the fact that our ideas are permanently recorded in a global ''cyberblog'' and may be open to future debate even if we change our thinking.   Mitigating the consequences of privacy and security exposure requires educated citizens who are aware of the downside of a connected society and who understand the technologies that dictate our times. One place to start is in the classroom at all levels of education.   Daniel Farkas Pleasantville, N.Y., Dec. 6, 2009   The writer is chairman of the information technology department at the Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems of Pace University.

F.B.I. AND STATES VASTLY EXPANDING DATABASES OF DNA,"Law enforcement officials are vastly expanding their collection of DNA to include millions more people who have been arrested or detained but not yet convicted. The move, intended to help solve more crimes, is raising concerns about the privacy of petty offenders and people who are presumed innocent. Until now, the federal government genetically tracked only convicts. But starting this month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation will join 15 states that collect DNA samples from those awaiting trial and will collect DNA from detained immigrants -- the vanguard of a growing class of genetic registrants. The F.B.I., with a DNA database of 6.7 million profiles, expects to accelerate its growth rate from 80,000 new entries a year to 1.2 million by 2012 -- a 15-fold increase. F.B.I. officials say they expect DNA processing backlogs -- which now stand at more than 500,000 cases -- to increase.  Law enforcement officials say that expanding the DNA databanks to include legally innocent people will help solve more violent crimes. They point out that DNA has helped convict thousands of criminals and has exonerated more than 200 wrongfully convicted people. But criminal justice experts cite Fourth Amendment privacy concerns and worry that the nation is becoming a genetic surveillance society. ''DNA databases were built initially to deal with violent sexual crimes and homicides -- a very limited number of crimes,'' said Harry Levine, a professor of sociology at City University of New York who studies policing trends. ''Over time more and more crimes of decreasing severity have been added to the database. Cops and prosecutors like it because it gives everybody more information and creates a new suspect pool.'' Courts have generally upheld laws authorizing compulsory collection of DNA from convicts and ex-convicts under supervised release, on the grounds that criminal acts diminish privacy rights. DNA extraction upon arrest potentially erodes that argument, a recent Congressional study found. ''Courts have not fully considered legal implications of recent extensions of DNA-collection to people whom the government has arrested but not tried or convicted,'' the report said. Minors are required to provide DNA samples in 35 states upon conviction, and in some states upon arrest. Three juvenile suspects in November filed the only current constitutional challenge against taking DNA at the time of arrest. The judge temporarily stopped DNA collection from the three youths, and the case is continuing. Sixteen states now take DNA from some who have been found guilty of misdemeanors. As more police agencies take DNA for a greater variety of lesser and suspected crimes, civil rights advocates say the government's power is becoming too broadly applied. ''What we object to -- and what the Constitution prohibits -- is the indiscriminate taking of DNA for things like writing an insufficient funds check, shoplifting, drug convictions,'' said Michael Risher, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. This year, California began taking DNA upon arrest and expects to nearly double the growth rate of its database, to 390,000 profiles a year from 200,000. One of those was Brian Roberts, 29, who was awaiting trial for methamphetamine possession. Inside the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles last month, Mr. Roberts let a sheriff's deputy swab the inside of his cheek. Mr. Roberts's DNA will be translated into a numerical sequence at the F.B.I.'s DNA database, the largest in the world. The system will search for matches between Mr. Roberts's DNA and other profiles every Monday, from now into the indeterminate future -- until one day, perhaps decades hence, Mr. Roberts might leave a drop of blood or semen at some crime scene. Law enforcement officials say that DNA extraction upon arrest is no different than fingerprinting at routine bookings and that states purge profiles after people are cleared of suspicion. In practice, defense lawyers say this is a laborious process that often involves a court order. (The F.B.I. says it has never received a request to purge a profile from its database.) When DNA is taken in error, expunging a profile can be just as difficult. In Pennsylvania, Ellyn Sapper, a Philadelphia public defender, has spent weeks trying to expunge the profile taken erroneously of a 14-year-old boy guilty of assault and bicycle theft. ''I'm going to have to get a judge's order to make sure that all references to his DNA are gone,'' she said. The police say that the potential hazards of genetic surveillance are worth it because it solves crimes and because DNA is more accurate than other physical evidence. ''I've watched women go from mug-book to mug-book looking for the man who raped her,'' said Mitch Morrissey, the Denver district attorney and an advocate for more expansive DNA sampling. ''It saves women's lives.'' Mr. Morrissey pointed to Britain, which has fewer privacy protections than the United States and has been taking DNA upon arrest for years. It has a population of 61 million -- and 4.5 million DNA profiles. ''About 8 percent of the people commit about 70 percent of your crimes, so if you can get the majority of that community, you don't have to do more than that,'' he said. In the United States, 8 percent of the population would be roughly 24 million people. Britain may provide a window into America's genetic surveillance future: As of March 2008, 857,000 people in the British database, or about one-fifth, have no current criminal record. In December, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Britain violated international law by collecting DNA profiles from innocent people, including children as young as 10. Critics are also disturbed by the demographics of DNA databases. Again Britain is instructive. According to a House of Commons report, 27 percent of black people and 42 percent of black males are genetically registered, compared with 6 percent of white people. As in Britain, expanding genetic sampling in the United States could exacerbate racial disparities in the criminal justice system, according to Hank Greely, a Stanford University Law School professor who studies the intersection of genetics, policing and race. Mr. Greely estimated that African-Americans, who are about 12 percent of the national population, make up 40 percent of the DNA profiles in the federal database, reflective of their prison population. He also expects Latinos, who are about 13 percent of the population and committed 40 percent of last year's federal offenses -- nearly half of them immigration crimes -- to dominate DNA databases. Enforcement officials contend that DNA is blind to race. Federal profiles include little more information than the DNA sequence and the referring police agency. Subjects' names are usually kept by investigators. Rock Harmon, a former prosecutor for Alameda County, Calif., and an adviser to crime laboratories, said DNA demographics reflected the criminal population. Even if an innocent man's DNA was included in a genetic database, he said, it would come to nothing without a crime scene sample to match it. ''If you haven't done anything wrong, you have nothing to fear,'' he said. "
F.B.I. Indicts Dozens in Online Bank Fraud,"In what it is calling Operation Phish Phry, the F.B.I. began arresting 53 people on Wednesday on charges of conducting a vast financial fraud based on phishing -- the act of tricking Internet users into revealing their passwords and other information.    The arrests were in Southern California, Nevada and North Carolina, while the authorities in Egypt sought to arrest 47 people whom the F.B.I. said were co-conspirators.    An 86-page indictment, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles, accuses the defendants of tricking people into giving up their bank account information. The F.B.I. said that this was the largest number of defendants ever charged in a cybercrime case, and that they had stolen at least $2 million from 2007 to last month.   The scams victimized people with accounts at Bank of America and Wells Fargo, two of the nation's largest banks. The online component of the fraud was perpetrated in Egypt, Keith B. Bolcar, the acting chief of the F.B.I.'s Los Angeles bureau, said.  The defendants there sent mass e-mail messages that appeared to be authentic communication from the banks, the F.B.I. said.    The people who clicked on those e-mail messages were sent to fake Web sites made to look identical to the real banking sites, where they were asked to enter personal information like their bank account numbers, passwords, Social Security numbers and drivers' license numbers.   The co-conspirators in the United States took over from there, transferring funds into their own accounts and remitting some money back to their accomplices in Egypt, according to the indictment.   ''It was very well done, it was very organized and everybody got paid,'' Mr. Bolcar said.   The F.B.I. said the mastermind of the operation in the United States was Kenneth Joseph Lucas, 25, who had help from John Clarke, a friend, and Nichole Merzi, Mr. Lucas's former girlfriend. A public defender for Mr. Lucas did not immediately return a call seeking comment.   According to the indictment, the trio would ask other conspirators, some down on their luck, to open accounts and then withdraw money that had been transferred from victims' accounts. They would then send some money to participants in Egypt.    The investigation began in early 2007, when the banks alerted the F.B.I. to the fraud. Tara Burke, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, would not comment specifically on this case but said the bank ''monitors for fraudulent sites and works to shut them down as quickly as possible.''   Each of the 53 defendants named in the indictment is charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Some defendants face other charges.   The case highlights the pernicious problem of phishing, in which online scammers send e-mail messages and build Web sites that look authentic, then make off with sensitive information. Early this week, more than 10,000 addresses and passwords for customer accounts on Hotmail, one of Microsoft's Web-based e-mail services, appeared online, apparently after being stolen via phishing.    In what appeared to be a separate incident, a list of more than 20,000 addresses and passwords for accounts on Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo and AOL were posted to a Web site. The Internet companies said they were working with affected customers to help them recover their accounts.   Chet Wisniewski, senior security adviser at Sophos, a Web security firm, doubted the arrests would have an effect on the number of online banking scams. ''I would imagine there are many different groups doing similar things,'' he said. ''You squash one bug and another one emerges. If there's an opportunity to make money, someone will be there to collect the bill.'' "
Plugging In $40 Computers,"Plugging In    $40 Computers   What would you do with a $40 Linux computer the size of a plug adapter?   The Marvell Technology Group is counting on an army of computer engineers and hackers to answer that question. It has created a ''plug computer,'' below. It's a tiny plastic box that you plug into an electrical outlet. There's no display. But there is an Ethernet jack to connect to a home network and a U.S.B. socket for attaching a hard drive, camera or other device. Inside is a 1.2-gigahertz Marvell chip, called an application processor, running a version of the Linux operating system.    All this can be yours for $99 today and probably for under $40 in two years.   ''There's not much in there,'' said Sehat Sutardja, Marvell's chief executive and co-founder. It's just a few chips and the sort of power supply used to charge a cellphone battery. Because this computer uses chips designed for cellphones, it uses far less power than larger computers.   Marvell  is  a major player in semiconductors, with annual sales of more than $2 billion. It makes more than half the microprocessors that control hard-disk drives and is also a supplier of chips that go into cellphones.   Mr. Sutardja envisions an explosion of innovation spawned by the combination of open-source software and powerful chips that are becoming available at very low cost.   The first plausible use for the plug computer is to attach one of these gizmos to a U.S.B. hard drive. Voila, you've got a network server. CloudEngines, a start-up, has in fact built a $99 plug computer called Pogoplug that will let you share the files on your hard drive, not only in your home but also anywhere on the Internet.   Another application might be to connect a security camera to the Internet, adding enough intelligence to help analyze images to distinguish between a stray dog and a cat burglar.   ''The uses of an application processor are endless,'' Mr. Sutardja said. ''It is up to smart people to imagine what it can do.'' SAUL HANSELLCOMMENT:  The plug computer could be used as an excellent energy-saving file server. Right now I keep running my home desktop for the same purpose. It could easily replace that I guess. -- Mahmudul Hasan, May 22 "
"After Outcry, China Delays Requirement for Web-Filtering Software","Facing strong resistance at home and abroad, China on Tuesday delayed enforcement of a new rule requiring manufacturers to install Internet filtering software on all new computers.   The delay by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology was announced through Xinhua, the official news agency, one day before the July 1 deadline for the software to be installed on all computers sold in China.    The software, called Green Dam-Youth Escort, has caused a torrent of protests from both Chinese computer users and global computer makers, including many in the United States, since the government order became public in early June.     The Obama administration has officially warned China that the requirement could violate free-trade agreements, and sent trade officials to Beijing recently to press the government to rescind the decision. In Beijing on Tuesday, a United States Embassy spokesman said Washington welcomed the announcement.    China has said the software is designed to filter out pornography and violence to protect minors, but many experts say it can also block any other content that the authorities deem subversive.    The ministry said the mandatory installation would be delayed for an indefinite period to give computer producers more time to put the order into effect.   As a practical matter, the abrupt postponement bows to reality because most of China's computer retailers have large stocks of machines, manufactured months before the decree was announced, that have yet to be sold. Many global computer makers have declined to say how they would comply with the requirement, apparently hoping that the government would delay or reverse its decision under international pressure.   The filtering software has been the object of furious online debate since the requirement to install it was disclosed. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which licensed the technology from two Chinese developers, says the software automatically blocks Web surfers from seeing ''unhealthy Internet content.'' Updated lists of banned content are automatically downloaded onto users' computers from the developers' servers.   But the software's current list of banned words, posted online by Chinese hackers, is laced with political topics. Businesses have complained that the software is so poorly designed that it opens computers not just to government snooping, but also to hacker attacks by vandals and criminals.    On Friday, the leaders of 22 international business organizations delivered a letter to Prime Minister Wen Jiabao arguing that Green Dam flouted China's professed goal of building an information-based society, and that it threatened security, privacy and free speech. A day earlier, the European Union protested that the software was clearly designed to limit free speech.    Global computer makers have contended that they are being forced to install untested software for purposes that they may regard as objectionable.    In Washington, the Business Software Alliance, a group representing software makers worldwide, said Tuesday that it was encouraged by the government's delay and hoped for ''a thorough examination of the related technology issues.''   Green Dam works only on computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. So far, no version has been released for Linux and Apple's Macintosh systems. Nor would the software be required in Hong Kong or Macao, said one expert familiar with the government's requirement.    The Chinese government has said little about the requirement. Zhang Chenmin, the founder of one Green Dam developer, Jinhui Computer System Engineering, has frequently described the software order as voluntary and innocuous, but he did not respond Tuesday to telephone calls and text messages seeking comment.    It appeared that many computer makers had yet to comply with the directive, not only in the hope that the government would alter its plans, but also because the order gave them scant time to test Green Dam with their machines.    Some did comply. Acer, a Taiwan manufacturer that assembles many of its products in China, has said that it will install Green Dam on its machines. A spokesman for Lenovo, China's best-selling computer brand, did not respond to a question about its Green Dam policies, although some Beijing vendors said the software had been installed on some Lenovo models.    Hewlett-Packard -- the No. 2 computer brand in China, according to IDC, a market-intelligence company -- has been silent on its plans, as has Dell, the third-best-selling brand. According to the Web site Rconversation, which has published leaked documents regarding Green Dam, Sony has packaged a Green Dam software CD with some of its computers, along with a warning that it is not responsible for any problems the program may cause.    Major Beijing computer retailers said most computers being sold lacked the software. One of China's biggest electronics chains, Suning, insisted Tuesday that the order applied only to computers made after July 1, not to those manufactured before that date but sold later at retail.    ''Suning is an outlet, so we're also playing the role of monitor'' to ensure that the computers have the required software, said a company spokesman, Min Juanqing. ''If the computer doesn't meet the requirement, we won't purchase it.''    Several other vendors said Tuesday that their existing stocks of computers were manufactured in April or May, and that computers with Green Dam were unlikely to reach their shelves for several weeks.    One vendor, identifying himself only as Mr. Wu, said some buyers saw little but trouble in the government's order. ''Some of our clients are concerned about the security of the software,'' he said. ''I myself haven't tried it yet, but we've been paying attention to it. I personally don't want to install this software, but the government has asked us to install it for our kids' good.    ''But we can help you uninstall it if you want,'' he said. ''It could be easy to erase it completely from your computer.'' "
"Gawker's Blogs, for a Time, Are Silenced by Hackers","It would be the old-media equivalent of every delivery truck in a newspaper's fleet breaking down at the same time.    On Sunday and Monday, the popular Web sites run by Gawker Media went off the grid after an apparent attack by hackers.    As such, devoted readers of the company's flagship site, Gawker.com, which chronicles Manhattan-centric media machinations, may have missed such tidbits of gossip as Ryan O'Neal accidentally hitting on his daughter Tatum at Farrah Fawcett's funeral and the Twitter habits of Sarah Palin's hairdresser.    ''We're having it investigated right now,'' Thomas Plunkett, the chief technology officer at Gawker Media, said Tuesday. Gawker's sites were working Tuesday, but as Mr. Plunkett was speaking he said the company's servers remained under a so-called denial-of-service attack.    The attack was aimed at Consumerist.com, Mr. Plunkett said, but the rest of the Gawker universe was collateral damage. Gawker sold Consumerist to Consumers Union, the nonprofit group that publishes Consumer Reports magazine, late last year, but Gawker still hosts the site.   In a memo to the company's staff Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Plunkett wrote, ''we have implemented several changes including isolating consumerist.com traffic, and adding several filters to deal with this specific type of attack. I expect everything will remain normal moving forward.''   But here, there seemed to be some disagreement. A spokesman for Consumers Union suggested it was unclear that Consumerist was indeed the target.   ''All we know as of now is the entire Gawker network had a service interruption,'' said Ken N. Weine, the spokesman for Consumers Union. ''The only thing that's clear is Consumerist has passionate readers who, like us, are happy the site is back up, fighting for consumers.''   Gawker's sites went down at 10:20 a.m. Sunday, and were back online by 6 p.m. Sunday, only to go down again around 7:30 Monday morning. The sites were troubled most of Monday, before resuming normal operations about 9 p.m., Mr. Plunkett said. Gawker's other sites include Jezebel, Deadspin and Gizmodo.   On Monday, the blogs' writers were in the difficult position of explaining to readers why the sites were down. In a post Monday afternoon, a Gawker blogger wrote, ''it always seems pretty pointless to put up a post on a website to say that that site's down. But to state the obvious: all Gawker media sites are having really bad server problems today. It's not just you.''   Anna Holmes, the editor of Jezebel, a site aimed at women and focused on matters of sex and popular culture, said that she told writers, who typically work from home, to ease up on Monday.   ''In a perverse way, I think it gave writers a much-needed break. There wasn't a lot of hair-pulling going on,'' she said.   Mr. Plunkett's investigators, and the staff at Datagram, a company in New York that provides space for the Gawker servers, will probably never know who led the attack, and whether Gawker was a specific target.   ''I assume it was done on purpose,'' Ms. Holmes said. ''As to why, we can only guess.'' "
Twitter For Sopranos and a Bat For a Violinist,"Is there anything Twitter can't do (when it isn't shut down by the cyberattacks of malicious hackers)? The popular online network connects you to your friends, feeds you the latest news -- and now it's about to help create a new opera. The Independent reported that the Royal Opera House of London is planning to produce a work called ''The Twitter Opera,'' in which the libretto will be composed of short messages sent by the public to the opera house's @youropera Twitter feed.   The music will be a mixture of familiar opera music and original compositions by Helen Porter, and the finished work will be performed Sept. 4 through 6. A cast has not yet been announced, but if you're a soprano who can handle a lyric like ''I can't stand you  --  no, stronger./You are a horse. And now escape is what I long for,'' the Royal Opera may have need for you. ... In other crazy classical music news (a phrase we don't often get to type), The Associated Press reported that Glenn Donnellan, above, a violinist for the National Symphony Orchestra, performed the national anthem at a Major League Baseball game on Saturday night using an electric violin that he made from a regulation bat. Mr. Donnellan, who performed before a game between the Washington Nationals and Arizona Diamondbacks in Washington, said he used a Derek Jeter-model bat purchased at a sporting goods store. ''I went to the Sports Authority with my fiddle one day after work, held it up to the bat and it looked about right,'' Mr. Donnellan said, according to The A.P. "
The High Security Risk Attached to Obama's Belt,"Why can't the most powerful person in the world keep his BlackBerry?   President-elect Barack Obama, who will take the oath of office next week, has repeatedly acknowledged a strong attachment to his Verizon BlackBerry 8830 World Edition smartphone, a k a  the BarackBerry. But in an interview last week, Mr. Obama lamented that the Secret Service and his lawyers appeared to be winning the battle to deny him this electronic link to friends, family and news of the larger world.   ''I'm still clinging to my BlackBerry,'' he said. ''I don't know that I'll win.''    No doubt millions of e-mail-addicted thumb jockeys can sympathize. But there are several compelling reasons to separate Mr. Obama from his beloved device.   The first is security. Research in Motion, the Canadian company that makes the BlackBerry, boasts that its devices and network were designed from the bottom up to protect the data that passes through them.    When companies (or the White House) install R.I.M. servers on their internal e-mail networks, their employees' BlackBerry messages are heavily encrypted before they are sent to one of R.I.M.'s network operations centers and passed on to other devices or networks.    This means that if someone were to intercept a message, it would be virtually impossible to unscramble the contents, R.I.M. says.    The F.B.I. feels comfortable enough with the technology to give BlackBerrys to its employees,  although it does not allow agents to transmit classified information over them. The National Security Agency, which is responsible for evaluating device security, said last week that nobody was available to discuss whether it had approved the use of BlackBerrys to send classified military information.   But Mr. Obama would be an extraordinarily juicy target for hackers, spies and other snoops who could try to exploit any kind of error made in configuring the device or the White House BlackBerry server to read Mr. Obama's e-mail.    Bruce Schneier, an expert on encryption and security, does not believe that the security systems at R.I.M.  --  or at any other company -- are completely safe, because of the inherent limitations of the humans who design and use them. ''If the BlackBerry was completely secure, it would be the first time in the history of mankind,'' Mr. Schneier said.   Then there's the question of whether Mr. Obama's BlackBerry could give away his location -- perhaps to people trying to harm him. Every mobile phone continuously contacts the nearby towers in its wireless network when it is turned on, so that calls and data can be routed to the phone.    It is technically possible that someone with access to a cellphone company's systems could use those contacts to roughly track Mr. Obama's movements, although this would not be easy.   Of course presidents, with their large entourages, do not move about with much secrecy anyway. The biggest security vulnerability of the BlackBerry -- and of any technology, for that matter -- may be the people who use and administer it.   Mr. Obama is unlikely to leave his BlackBerry in a taxi or choose ''Michelle'' as his password. (And even if he lost the device, it could be remotely shut down and erased.)  But with so much interest in the president-elect and his communications, privacy invaders would be poised to capitalize on any security slip.    The president-elect's next set of BlackBerry naysayers are the pesky lawyers, who worry that Mr. Obama's impromptu thumb-tapped conversations could become subject to legal battles.   Lawmakers, historians and open government groups routinely request all presidential communications under federal laws like the Freedom of Information Act. Under the 1978 Presidential Records Act, administrations are required to turn over their communications to public archivists, who make them public starting five years after the end of a president's final term.   The Bush administration made a novel effort to avoid disclosure  by using Republic National Committee e-mail accounts for some of its communications, which a judge in Washington recently called an ''apparently flagrant violation of the Presidential Records Act.''   Since Richard Nixon and his infamous tapes, all presidents have argued for their right to withhold some governmental communication under the mantle of executive privilege, and have resisted disclosure of their personal and political correspondence.    But these privacy claims can be hotly disputed, and judges may decide them on a message-by-message basis.    ''In this day of inevitable investigations, any time you have written documentation of what the president is saying on any particular subject, then in that investigation, these records may be requested and could be obtained,'' said Elizabeth A. McNamara, a lawyer at Davis Wright Tremaine in New York. ''Then you've got the president in the thick of it.''   All this bodes rather poorly for the president-elect's continued relationship with his BlackBerry, but perhaps that is not so bad. After all, do we really want the leader of the free world taking time off from the problems of climate change and economic collapse to manage his spam, or play a quick  game of  BrickBreaker?   Then there is the  fashion concern. Mr. Obama is known to sport his BlackBerry in a holster on his belt, which to many is the sartorial equivalent of wearing socks with sandals.  Ridding the president of the phone could avoid legitimizing that look.   The BlackBerry no doubt endears Mr. Obama to one element of his core constituency: hard-working, tech-obsessed professionals whose fingers are painfully cramped from trying to type on small keys. In a sense, then, the BlackBerry is no different from the accessories that other presidents used to help them relate to their political base, like Ronald Reagan's cowboy hats and jeans.   But those fashion statements seem less risky than a BlackBerry; it's harder to hack pants. "
Keeping That New PC Clean and Pure,"School starts soon, and many people are getting spanking-new computers. Ah, the joy of a new and more powerful toy -- and a clean slate.   A new PC, whether you know it or not, may well have freed you from many malicious programs that steal credit card numbers and other valuable information or otherwise obstruct your safe and private use of the Internet. Now is the time -- while you're getting everything set up just the way you like it -- to take some steps to keep your new machine clean and free of malware. Here is what you need to do before you do anything else.   CHECK YOUR FIREWALL SETTINGS  Do this before you even connect your computer to the Internet. Firewalls prevent certain unwanted traffic from reaching your computer, including worms that spread through network connections. New laptops and desktops with Windows Vista (and, come Oct. 22, the next version of the operating system, Windows 7) and netbooks using Windows XP SP2 or higher have a firewall that is built in and turned on by default. You can make sure all is well by going to the Windows Security Center,  clicking Start, then Control Panel,  then Security Center and Windows Firewall.    Mac users can check and adjust their firewall settings by clicking on the Apple icon and going to System Preferences and clicking on Security and then Firewall.  At a minimum, choose ''allow only essential services.''  A better option is to select ''set access for specific services and applications'' and play gatekeeper, allowing programs to connect as you need them, said Rich Mogull, founder of the security consultant firm Securosis.   UPDATE YOUR SOFTWARE    Even though you have a new machine, chances are that security fixes have been issued since the manufacturer loaded the software, so you will want to download those as soon as you get online.   Your new PC may prompt you to check for updates from Microsoft, but, if not, open Windows Update by clicking the Start  button, then All Programs  and then Windows Update.  On the left pane, click ''check for updates.'' (For more information about Windows Security, see  microsoft.com/protect.)   To help you keep Microsoft products up to date, Windows will prompt owners of new machines to sign up for automatic updates. You will see a screen asking if you want to  ''Help protect Windows automatically.'' Choose the first option,  ''Use recommended settings,'' so you get everything and don't have to worry about it again.     Barring an urgent problem, updates come out on the second Tuesday of the  month. To schedule exactly what time your updates are installed -- say at 3 a.m., when you are asleep -- open Windows Update and select Change Settings and make your choices. This is also a good time to turn on the Internet Explorer Phishing Filter, which can help keep you from turning over personal information to the wrong people.   For Mac users, your computer will automatically check for updates once a week. If you are a paranoid person, have it check more frequently by clicking Software Update in the System Preferences  panel and then choose Daily.    ADD SECURITY SOFTWARE  Firewalls won't help fend off viruses or Trojan horses that can come through e-mail messages, Web sites and pop-up ads. Given the frightening number of malicious programs that aim for Windows PCs, owners of these machines really need to use some security software. There are several free antivirus programs,   like  AVG 8.5 Free, Avast Antivirus and the forthcoming Microsoft Security Essentials, so even penniless students  have no excuse to go without. Note that Vista comes with Windows Defender, which blocks spyware and pop-up ads, and that program can be downloaded free by Windows XP SP2 machines.   Since a lot of malicious programs now come through Web sites, you will also want to use one of the many  free tools available to help you avoid malicious sites. Microsoft's newest browser, Internet Explorer 8, will warn you if you try to visit sites it deems unsafe, deceptive or carriers of a common Web attack type called ''cross-site scripting'' attacks. Other browsers, including Chrome, Firefox and Safari, also warn users about potentially unsafe sites, using a blacklist kept by Google. There is also McAfee's SiteAdvisor, a free add-on for the Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers (the latter works on both Windows and Mac), that shows site reputation information within search results pages, including warnings about potentially dangerous sites.   There are  few malicious programs that aim for Macs, so an antivirus program isn't essential at this point. That said, some Mac experts think that the days of peace and security for Macs may be waning. There have a been a few Trojan horses recently, and some Web attacks don't care which operating system you use. If you frequent file-sharing sites, or your employer requires it, buy  a Mac antivirus program.   SORT OUT THE APPLICATIONS New Windows PCs typically come loaded with all kinds of third-party programs, many of which you will never use.   ''In a lot of cases, that's extra software that might have vulnerabilities'' that hackers could exploit, says Chad Dougherty, a vulnerability analyst at the CERT Program at the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute.    To avoid problems, eliminate the programs you don't need by clicking the Start button and choosing Control Panel and then Programs to see a list of what is on your machine. Select unwanted programs and then hit the Uninstall button at the top of the program list.   Then sign up for automatic updates from the makers of any software you intend to keep -- or that you later install yourself, for that matter. To help you make sure you have checked out everything, download Secunia PSI, a free tool that will help you make sure that all the programs on your PC get security patches.   Speaking of that, always be careful about which  software you install from the Internet, whether you have a PC or a Mac.  These programs can contain vulnerabilities, and pirated programs and random add-ons may be outright malicious. "
Digital Pirates Winning Battle With Major Hollywood Studios,"On the day last July when ''The Dark Knight'' arrived in theaters, Warner Brothers was ready with an ambitious antipiracy campaign that involved months of planning and steps to monitor each physical copy of the film.    The campaign failed miserably. By the end of the year, illegal copies of the Batman movie had been downloaded more than seven million times around the world, according to the media measurement firm BigChampagne, turning it into a visible symbol of Hollywood's helplessness against the growing problem of online video piracy.    The culprits, in this case, are the anonymous pirates who put the film online and enabled millions of Internet users to view it. Because of widely available broadband access and a new wave of streaming sites, it has become surprisingly easy to watch pirated video online  -- a troubling development for entertainment executives and copyright lawyers.     Hollywood may at last be having its Napster moment -- struggling against the video version of the digital looting that capsized the music business. Media companies say that piracy  --  some prefer to call it ''digital theft'' to emphasize the criminal nature of the act  --  is an increasingly mainstream pursuit. At the same time, DVD sales, a huge source of revenue for film studios, are sagging. In 2008, DVD shipments dropped to their lowest levels in five years. Executives worry that the economic downturn will persuade more users to watch stolen shows and movies.    ''Young people, in particular, conclude that if it's so easy, it can't be wrong,'' said Richard Cotton, the general counsel for NBC Universal.   People have swapped illegal copies of songs, television shows and movies on the Internet for years. The slow download process, often using a peer-to-peer technology called BitTorrent, required patience and a modicum of sophistication by users. Now, users do not even have to download. Using a search engine, anyone can find free copies of movies, still in theaters, in a matter of minutes. Classic TV, like every ''Seinfeld'' episode ever produced, is also free for the streaming. Some of these digital copies are derived from bootlegs, while others are replicas of the advance review videos that studios send out before a release.   TorrentFreak.com, a Web site based in Germany that tracks which shows are most  downloaded, estimates that each episode of ''Heroes,'' a series on NBC, is downloaded five million times, representing a substantial loss for the network. (On TV, ''Heroes'' averages 10 million American viewers each week).    A wave of streaming sites, which allow people to start watching video immediately without transferring a full copy of the movie or show to their hard drive, are making it easier than ever to watch free Hollywood content online. Many of these sites are located in countries with lackluster piracy enforcement efforts, like China, and are hard to monitor, so media companies do not have a clear sense of how much content is being stolen.   But many industry experts  say the practice is becoming much more prevalent. ''Streaming has gotten efficient and cheap enough and it gives users more control than downloads do. This is where piracy is headed,'' said James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''Consumers are under the impression that everything they want to watch should be easily streamable.''    Some of the first fights over video piracy on the Internet involved YouTube, the Google-owned Web site that introduced many people to streaming. Some legal disputes between YouTube and copyright owners remain, most notably a $1 billion lawsuit filed by Viacom, but the landscape ''has improved markedly,'' Mr. Cotton said. YouTube uses filters and digital flags to weed out illegal content.    But if media companies are winning the battle against illegal video clips, they are losing the battle over illicit copies of full-length TV episodes and films. The Motion Picture Association of America says that illegal downloads and streams are now responsible for about 40 percent of the revenue the industry loses annually as a result of piracy.    ''It is becoming, among some demographics, a very mainstream behavior,'' said Eric Garland, the chief executive of BigChampagne.    The files are surprisingly easy to find,  partly because of efforts by people like Mohy Mir, the 23-year-old founder of the Toronto based video streaming site SuperNova Tube. The site, run by Mr. Mir and one other employee, allows anyone to post a video clip of any length. As the site has grown more popular, SuperNova Tube has become a repository for copyrighted content. On a recent day, the new movies ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop'' and ''Taken'' could easily be found on the site by following links from other sites, called ''link farms,'' which guide users to secret stashes of copyrighted content spread around the Web.    Mr. Mir says he did not know these files were there and that his company promptly responds to any request from major rights- holders. He also says that piracy is actually his largest problem  --  advertisers flee when they are alerted to infringing material  --  and that he is constantly removing files at the request of Hollywood studios.    His reluctance is seemingly belied by his site's name, which is based on  the popular SuperNova BitTorrent hub, and its slogan: ''We Work with uploaders, not against them.''    The piracy problem, however, does seem to weigh on him. He removed a copy of the movie ''Twilight'' from his site after a reporter  pointed it out to him recently. ''I think about getting sued every day. If that happens it will definitely take us out of business,'' he said.   Mr. Mir has reason for concern. In December, the motion picture association sued three Web sites that it said were facilitating copyright infringement by identifying and indexing links to pirated material around the Web.   John Malcolm, the association's director of worldwide antipiracy operations, said that although the group does not sue individuals for watching pirated videos, other lawsuits against Web sites are forthcoming, and he acknowledged that the challenge is stiff.    ''There are a lot of very technologically sophisticated people out there who are very good at this and very good at hiding,'' Mr. Malcolm said. ''We have limited resources to bring to the fight.''    With so much pirated material online, Hollywood is turning to technological solutions. Perhaps most important, media companies are learning from the music industry's mistakes and trying to avert broader adoption of piracy techniques. The No. 1 lesson: provide the video on the platform that users want it.   Mark Ishikawa, BayTSP's founder and chief executive, sees a correlation between the availability of content through traditional legal channels and their popularity on pirate networks.    ''When DVD releases are postponed, demand always goes up, because people don't have an authorized channel to buy,'' he said.    Partly in response to the piracy problem, a cornucopia of video Web sites now feature the latest episodes of virtually every broadcast TV show. Movie studios are experimenting with video-on-demand releases and other ways to offer films on demand. Legal alternatives, the companies hope, will stifle the stealing. The music industry, by comparison, waited years to provide legal options for online listeners.   ''That's how you start to marginalize piracy  --  not just by using the stick, but by using the carrot,'' Mr. Garland said.  "
The Rush to Stake a Claim Online,"''Cybersquatting,'' the practice of maliciously snapping up a Web site with someone else's trademark in its domain name, is illegal in the United States. It is also an easy way to make money; a cybersquatter can impersonate the trademark's owner, sell ad space to the victim's competitors, or extort a payment in return for turning over the Web site.    A recent report from MarkMonitor, a company that sells domain names to large companies and protects them from online misuse of their brands, suggests the practice is increasingly popular in the United States -- despite laws that allow trademark holders to sue. Over 2008, MarkMonitor tracked an 18 percent rise in incidence of cybersquatting, which it calculated by examining every new domain name created, checking for a trademark in the URL, and then seeing whether the trademark's owner also owned the Web site.   Fred Felman, left, MarkMonitor's chief marketing officer, said that companies take elaborate steps to counter cybersquatters, including buying up tens of thousands of related domain names. ''Most of our customers' portfolios are made up of 10 percent URLs they use or intend to use, and 90 percent defensive domains,'' he said. ALEX MINDLIN  "
Piracy Puts Film Online One Month Before Open,"In a case of piracy that some analysts called unprecedented, untold thousands of people watched a version of ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' online Wednesday, a full month before its scheduled theater release.    The film's distributor, 20th Century Fox, said it did not know how the unfinished copy of the comic book adaptation was leaked onto the Internet. The copy was missing many special effects and included temporary sound and music. Nonetheless, it circulated widely online beginning late Tuesday, even prompting some viewers to publish reviews, favorable and unfavorable, of the hotly anticipated film. ''Wolverine'' stars Hugh Jackman in the title role and is set to open on May 1.    The troubling leak  --  which some people initially dismissed as an April Fool's Day prank  -- occurred at a time when media companies are working harder than ever to curtail digital piracy of content. Illicit recordings of films usually appear on the Internet shortly after their theater debuts, but leaks before the premiere dates are rare. Hollywood studios spend millions of dollars to track every step of the film production process to avoid such potentially costly leaks.     Eric Garland, the chief executive of the file-sharing monitoring firm BigChampagne, called the widespread downloading of ''Wolverine'' a ''one-of-a-kind case.'' ''We've never seen a high-profile film  --  a film of this budget, a tentpole movie with this box office potential  --  leak in any form this early,'' he said.    The studio, a unit of the News Corporation, spent the day demanding that copies of the film be removed from the largely anonymous swath of Web sites that swap movie files. But the copies propagated at such a swift rate that the digital cops could not keep up. BigChampagne estimated  the digital film copy had been downloaded in the low hundreds of thousands of times in its first 24 hours on the Internet.    The studio said the F.B.I. and the Motion Picture Association of America were both investigating the film's premature distribution.    ''The source of the initial leak and any subsequent postings will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,'' the company said, adding  ''the courts have handed down significant criminal sentences for such acts in the past.''    Media companies use watermarks and other technological strategies to identify the sources of leaks.    ''Wolverine'' is not the first film to receive an unintended preview on the Internet. Another superhero film, 2003's ''Hulk,'' showed up as a download about two weeks before its release. But the major studios hoped they had learned enough since then to keep it from happening again.    Mr. Garland said the existence of the illicit file could theoretically depress the box-office receipts for the film, but he emphasized that the online viewers would be only a tiny percentage of the total audience. The ''other fear is bad word of mouth,'' he said. As twisted as it may seem, ''you would rather have a very high-quality version of the film leak than a premature working version of the film leak, because it's not your best work.''    In the case of ''Wolverine,'' some of the computer-generated scenes were missing and other parts were unedited. The studio noted that some fan Web sites condemned the leak. But other Internet users downloaded the file and weighed in with reviews.    ''This is bad bad news for Fox,'' a movie blog called In GOB We Trust said on Wednesday, asserting that negative comments about the film would reduce its box-office prospects. But the blog reviewed the film anyway, saying that the creators decided to ''dumb it down and essentially make a cartoon.'' "
Google and the Big Music Labels Are Betting on Free Downloads in China,"Can global music companies make money by giving away songs in China, where piracy is rampant?   They certainly hope so. Last Monday, the world's biggest record labels, including EMI, the Warner Music Group and Vivendi's Universal Music, said they would seek to profit here by working with Google and offering free downloads of music to anyone inside China.   Google, which has no plans to offer the service elsewhere, hopes to build traffic and win new advertisers by allowing the Chinese to search for free music on its site.    Record labels say that instead of earning money from each download, they will share advertising revenue with Google's partner in the deal, a Chinese company called Top100.cn.   The partnership, analysts say, could help determine the future of how valuable content is distributed in China, which has already overtaken the United States as the world's biggest Internet market.   Until now, China has been a hotbed of online piracy and free downloads of music, film and even television shows.   According to the International Federation of Phonographic Industries, which represents the global record makers, 99 percent of the music downloaded in China violates copyrights.   Lawsuits by major music labels and promises by the Chinese government to crack down on Internet piracy have failed to deter the practices.   But now, the music industry says that, at least in China, it can live with giving away music.   ''The level of online advertising in China is quite mature, so we're willing to try this out,'' said Sandy Monteiro, a senior vice president at the Universal Music Group.   The deal creates a powerful tandem -- the world's biggest online search and advertising engine, paired with powerhouses from the music industry --aiming  to take on China's leading search engine, Baidu, whose Web traffic has grown partly because of its links to free, unlicensed music.   Global record labels have sued Baidu, trying to force the company to stop linking to unlicensed sites. But Baidu, which declined to be interviewed for this article, has said it is simply a search engine and does not engage in piracy.   With its popular searches, Baidu has managed to keep far ahead of Google in China, with a search market share approaching 65 percent.   But analysts say Google could be significantly aided by the new music partnership.   ''It's a smart move for Google,'' said Ma Xiushan, deputy director general of the China Intellectual Property Society in Beijing. ''Google has realized the point: they have to open the access for downloading so that they can compete with Chinese competitors and attract more users.''   Google executives say they acted because a music search function was one of the few elements they did not have in China.   According to government figures, about 84 percent of China's nearly 300 million Internet users download music over the Web, and most of it is used for cellphone ring tones.   Google hopes that by offering free, high-quality music -- giving consumers fewer worries about viruses or damaged tracks -- it can cut into Baidu's lead.   For the music industry, which believes it has lost hundreds of millions of dollars to online piracy, the deal promises to deliver a steady stream of revenue and could also put pressure on Baidu and other Chinese Internet companies to distribute legitimate tracks or risk being locked out of future deals.   Not everyone believes it will work.   ''Google's move is just burning money to compete with Baidu's dominance,'' said Guo Chunlong, founder of yobo.com, a music and entertainment Web site. ''Sharing ad revenues with music companies  --  this business model is not sustainable. How many page views could generate the money both Google and the music companies expect?''   Music executives dispute that. But they say the China deal is not a model for the rest of the world. They say different regions call for different approaches -- some that charge for downloads, some that stream music for a single subscription price and some that are supported by advertising.   In China, they decided an advertising-supported model was best.   ''China was a curious place,'' said Mr. Monteiro at Universal Music. ''It was the one market we couldn't crack. And then Google approached us about this model.''   Erik Zhang, one of the founders of Top100.cn, said advertising-supported free downloads were just the first of several stages in the proposed deal.   The partners say they could broaden offerings to include paid V.I.P. memberships, free concert tickets or backstage passes and other benefits.   But one thing is clear: Google and its partners want to limit this experiment to China.   For instance, the site -- which will eventually offer about 1.1 million tracks -- is in Chinese, and only Internet addresses based in China can download free music. Could China's clever pirates download this music free and then swap it or sell it in other parts of the world, possibly undermining the system?   Last week, for example, a user downloaded a music track in China and easily shipped it to a friend in London.   Music producers said customers might try this, but they are trying to put up legal and technical hurdles to such ploys.   ''We'll definitely need to watch it,'' Mr. Monteiro, of  Universal Music, said. "
Plan to Curb Internet Piracy Advances in France,"French lawmakers are poised to approve a law to create the world's first surveillance system for Internet piracy, one that would force Internet service providers in some cases to disconnect customers accused of making illegal downloads.   The proposal, called the ''Creation et Internet'' and known informally as the ''three strikes'' directive, has won preliminary votes by the Parliament and is expected to be approved in both houses Thursday. It has support from the governing party of President Nicolas Sarkozy.   The law empowers music and film industry associations to hire companies to analyze the downloads of individual users to detect piracy, and to report violations to a new agency overseeing copyright protection. The agency would be authorized to trace the illegal downloads back to individuals using the downloading computer's unique identification number, known as its Internet Protocol, or IP, address, which the Internet service providers have on record.    For a first violation, the agency would send a warning by e-mail.   If a user made another illegal download within three months,  a second warning would be sent by certified mail. If a third infraction occurred within a year, the service provider would be required to sever service.   Piracy costs the film and music industry in France at least 1 billion euros, or $1.3 billion, a year in lost sales, according to industry figures.   ''This law is definitely overdue and it's only a fair and proportionate response to a major problem,'' said Marc Guez, the managing director of the French Society of Phonographic Producers, which represents recording companies. ''Our members are losing more than 500 million euros a year in sales.''   While piracy surveillance systems have been discussed in a number of countries, the French plan goes farther than the measures under consideration elsewhere. On April 1, a law in Sweden called the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive took effect, allowing industry groups to more easily prosecute copyright piracy.   In the United States, a Congressional committee this week began studying the issue. In a hearing Monday before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, Steven Soderbergh, the film director, cited the French initiative in asking lawmakers to deputize the American film industry to pursue copyright pirates.   In France, the law has attracted prominent  support from the French music and film establishment, including Johnny Hallyday, the French rock star, and Denis Olivennes, the former chief executive of the FNAC retail chain.   The International Federation of Phonographic Industry, a group based in London that represents the global music industry, said that 95 percent of all songs downloaded on the Internet last year -- including those in France -- were illegal downloads. Globally, illegal music downloads cost  $12.8 billion in sales, according to the group.   While supporters and opponents both predicted that the proposal would become law, some lawyers and Internet advocates said the measure would face a tougher road before the French Constitutional Council, which can invalidate laws that it determines do not conform with the Constitution.   One of several controversial aspects of the proposal places the onus of proving innocence on those accused, who would only be able to protest their innocence after they were disconnected from the Internet.   ''It is always hard to predict how the Constitutional Council may rule, but this new law does not protect the fundamental right to defend oneself,'' said Cedric Manara, a law professor at the Edhec Business School in Nice.   Winston Maxwell, a media lawyer at Hogan & Hartson in Paris, said the legal challenges might delay the measure's effective date.   ''But I doubt the Constitutional Council will decide a French citizen has the right to make illegal downloads,'' Maxwell said.   Nonetheless, Internet advocates call the French proposal legally unsound on the ground that there are inadequate the provisions for challenging an action, and because it gives industry groups the power to police the Internet. Others question whether the law would unfairly penalize those whose wireless broadband accounts are misused by others. The French law tries to anticipate this by making it a civil infraction for citizens to fail to ''secure'' their broadband accounts by using approved filtering technology.   That burden, theoretically, would fall on public Wi-Fi hot spots.   Nicolas D'Arcy, a spokesman for France's ISP Association, the Association des Fournisseurs d'Acces et de Services Internet, said Internet providers were hoping the law would not take effect.   Internet service providers, Mr. D'Arcy said, do not want to become the enforcement arm of French justice and do not trust the law to insulate them from suits brought by customers whose service has been cut off.   ''There are so many things wrong with this,'' Mr. D'Arcy said.   Other critics say the law will not stop illegal downloads.   Jeremie Zimmermann, director of La Quadrature du Net, an Internet advocacy group based in Paris, said some computer users would turn to encrypted downloads and other methods to avoid detection. On Wednesday, a Swedish company, the Pirate Bay, began a service called Ipredator, which lets users use its virtual private network to make anonymous downloads for 5 euros a month.   ''The French law will only drive people further underground,'' Mr. Zimmermann said. ''It will make the situation worse.''   Michel Thiolliere, the French Senate sponsor of the legislation, said the system would probably survive legal review by the council and help preserve the rights of French artists, musicians and actors.   ''The mechanism is reasonable and a graduated response designed to bring Internet users to a new world where the rights of creators must be respected,'' he said. "
France Rejects Plan to Curb Internet Piracy,"In what the French government denounced as a ''sad comedy,'' lawmakers on Thursday rejected President Nicolas Sarkozy's plan to bolster the movie and music industries by cutting off the Internet connections of persistent copyright pirates.   The surprise outcome delayed, but may not kill, the most far-reaching initiative by any government in the battle against unauthorized file-sharing. It is also a major embarrassment for Mr. Sarkozy, who has rallied sufficient legislative support for other measures popular with French media companies, like phasing out advertising on public television.    Until Thursday afternoon, the anti-piracy plan appeared on track for passage in the National Assembly, after having been approved by the other house of Parliament, the Senate. A committee of members of both chambers had worked out differences this week.   But the measure, while supported by many members of the French cultural establishment, had always been unpopular with ordinary voters. File-sharing is widespread in France, where legitimate online services like Apple's iTunes music store have never caught on to the extent that they have in the United States.   Rather than stick their political necks out, many members of the 577-member National Assembly, even those in Sarkozy's  party, decided to skip the vote. With only a handful of hard-core supporters in the room, apparently confident of passage, the measure was put to a vote by a show of hands.   At the last minute, several members of the opposition Socialist Party rushed in to vote against the plan, according to Christine Albanel, the culture minister, in what she called a ''cynical maneuver by the opposition.'' The bill was rejected, 21-15.   Jeremie Zimmermann, director of La Quadrature du Net, an Internet advocacy group in Paris, described the outcome as ''a huge political blow'' for Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Albanel. ''It's a victory for the citizens and the civil liberties over the corporate interests,'' Mr. Zimmermann added.   While film studios and record companies blame piracy for billions of euros in lost sales, critics said Mr. Sarkozy's plan would violate Internet users' rights and might have been unworkable.   Under the proposal, the music and movie industries would be allowed to analyze the downloads of individual Internet users to look for unauthorized sharing of movies and music, and to report violations to a newly created, government-run agency. The agency would send warning letters to violators; after the third letter, the Internet service provider would be required to sever service.   Patrick Bloche, a Socialist member of the National Assembly who has led opposition to the Sarkozy proposal, said the plan was ''politically dead.''   ''This effort to intimidate 18 million French Internet users, the vote today showed, will not succeed,'' he said.   Under France's parliamentary system, it is unusual for a government initiative to be voted down. According to the newspaper Le Figaro, it was the first time that a bill worked out in a joint committee of Parliament had been rejected.   But French lawmakers have sometimes entertained maverick approaches on media-related issues. Three years ago, members of the National Assembly discussed, but then rejected, a proposal for a ''global license'' for anyone to download unlimited amounts of music in return for a modest annual fee.   Sarkozy's anti-piracy plan could still be revived, at least in its broad outlines. Ms. Albanel said in a statement that she was ''determined to fight for its adoption by the two chambers when the bill is debated anew, by the end of the month.''   The progress of the bill was being followed closely outside France because other governments, under pressure from the entertainment industry, have also been considering more aggressive laws against piracy. In South Korea, for example, the government this month introduced a measure that would allow it to shut down online message boards that had repeatedly ignored warnings to remove pirated content.   Britain, meanwhile, has been pushing Internet providers and content companies to come up with a solution on their own, without requiring legislation -- so far, to no avail. In New Zealand, the government recently suspended a law requiring Internet service providers to cut off copyright pirates because the I.S.P.'s and content owners could not agree on how to enforce it.   ''The 'three strikes' policy is a highly politically charged and sensitive issue that triggers extreme reactions on both sides of the debate,'' said Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Forrester Research. The vote in Paris ''illustrates the risks associated with business issues being subject to political concerns.''   While many Socialists have long opposed the idea of cutting off Internet users, Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Albanel also apparently failed to persuade some party lawmakers to come into line.   Herve Rony, director general of S.N.E.P., a trade group for French record companies, said he thought a revived proposal, removing the requirement for payment to continue during the cutoff period, could win support from lawmakers.   ''Of course, we are very disappointed,'' he said. ''But it is probably just a political maneuver. It will take some weeks more, and that's a problem -- the more we wait, the more the people download.'' "
"File-Sharing Site Violated Copyright, Court Says","A court in Sweden on Friday convicted four men linked to the notorious Internet file-sharing service The Pirate Bay of violating copyright law, handing the music and movie industries a high-profile victory in their campaign to curb online piracy.   The court found that the men  --  the three founders, Frederik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm Warg and Peter Sunde, as well as Carl Lundstrom, who provided financing  --  had aided copyright infringement by operating the site, which provides links to thousands of songs, films, video games and other material, and helps users download them.    They were each sentenced to a year in prison and were also ordered to pay 30 million kronor, or about $3.6 million, in damages to leading entertainment companies.   The case has drawn a huge amount of attention among Internet users and media companies alike because of the size of The Pirate Bay  -- it is estimated to have more than 20 million users  -- and the defiant stance of its operators. The trial this winter took place amid a carnival atmosphere in Stockholm, with bands playing outside the courtroom and bloggers Twittering away.   John Kennedy, chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, one of the groups that had supported the case against The Pirate Bay, said the decision ''sent a strong message about the importance of copyright.''   ''We are not triumphant,'' he said. ''But we are satisfied that the court has clearly said that what they were doing was wrong.''   In the near term, however, the decision may have little effect on the day-to-day operations of The Pirate Bay, as the defendants have vowed to continue running the service as they appeal the ruling.   Kennedy said music and movie industry groups planned to file additional litigation to try to get The Pirate Bay shut down. He said that while he expected the defendants in the case to ''hand over the baton'' to others, that might now be more difficult.    ''There will be less people willing to step up to the plate,'' he said.   Over the last decade, media companies have won a series of court victories around the world against file-sharing services like Napster --  before it reinvented itself as a legal site  --  Kazaa and Grokster.    But unauthorized copying of remains a big problem for record business, in particular, with the music industry federation estimating that 95 percent of music downloads involve pirated work.    Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Forrester Research, said the decision Friday would not result in a ''meaningful'' decrease in piracy. Internet users are turning to new ways to share music, including streaming and messaging services, which are harder for copyright owners and enforcement officials to detect than downloads.   But he said the ruling was ''good p.r.'' for the music and movie industries.   ''There's a lot of value out of it, even though its value is not going to be a meaningful reduction in file sharing,'' he said. ''They have to be seen to be doing something, in the same way that customs fights drug trafficking  --  as a deterrent.''   Mr. Mulligan said the decision could encourage more music listeners to turn to a growing number of services that provide ''free'' digital music legally, as part of a broadband subscription or with the support of advertising, for example.   ''The best way to fight free is with free,'' he said.   The decision could also help alter perceptions of Sweden as a haven for piracy. A new law that took effect this month makes it easier for copyright owners to pursue illegal downloaders through the courts. Figures from Netnod, which operates Internet exchanges in Sweden, show that the volume of Internet traffic plunged as the law took effect  --  suggesting, analysts said, that some file-sharers may have been deterred.   The Pirate Bay could not immediately be reached for comment on the decision Friday.   On the site, a notice was posted calling the decision a ''crazy verdict.''   ''But as in all good movies, the heroes lose in the beginning but have an epic victory in the end anyhow,'' it said. ''That's the only thing Hollywood ever taught us.''   The Pirate Bay is one of the largest so-called Bit Torrent trackers, which facilitate downloads of large digital files by enlisting the help of other computers.   The defendants had maintained that they were innocent because they did not actually host any of the copyrighted material on their own servers.   As the media industries battle pirates in court, they have also been lobbying for tougher legislation against unauthorized file-sharing --  but with more limited success.   In France, the National Assembly last week rejected a government proposal to cut off the Internet connections of persistent copyright pirates, in a surprise vote. President Nicolas Sarkozy has said the government will reintroduce the measure at the end of the month.  "
Lockheed Won't Fight Pentagon On Jet Plan,"Lockheed Martin will accept the Pentagon's plans to phase out the F-22 fighter jet and will not lobby Congress to build more of the expensive planes, a top executive said on Tuesday.    Bruce L. Tanner, the company's chief financial officer, told stock analysts that the company had received ''a full hearing'' from Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and top Air Force officials, and ''we'll accept those decisions.''    Mr. Tanner made the comments in discussing the company's first-quarter results. Net income fell nearly 9 percent, to $666 million, or $1.68 a share,  compared with $730 million, or $1.75 a share, in the period a year earlier, the company said.   Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest military contractor, said growing pension costs had cut into its profit. But it still beat analysts' consensus forecast of $1.64 a share. Sales rose 4 percent, to $10.4 billion, just below the analyst forecast of $10.5 billion.   Legislators from Georgia, Connecticut and other states with major suppliers are still likely to push for more planes, saying they are concerned about job losses.   Mr. Tanner said that under previous contracts, F-22s would be assembled at Lockheed Martin's plant in Marietta, Ga., until 2012. He added that most of the workers there would be able to shift to expanding production lines for other planes.   Mr. Tanner also disputed a report in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that said computer hackers had downloaded ''sizable amounts'' of data on a program to build another fighter plane, the F-35, from the computer systems of two or three of the contractors.   Lockheed Martin is also the prime contractor for that plane. Mr. Tanner said that the company thought the article ''was incorrect in its representation of successful cyberattacks on the F-35 program.''   ''I've not heard of that, and to our knowledge there's never been any classified information breach,'' he told the analysts.   When asked about cyberattacks on the F-35 program, Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said, ''I'm not aware of any specific concerns.'' "
"Music Piracy Suit Against N.Y. Family Is Settled for $7,000","After battling a suburban family for four years over music downloads, the recording industry has agreed to accept $7,000 to settle a federal music piracy lawsuit.   If approved by a judge, the settlement would end a four-year fight between record companies and the family of Patricia Santangelo, 46, a mother of five, who lives in Wappingers Falls, N.Y.     She was accused of illegally downloading and distributing music, but she says she could not have downloaded anything because she did not know how.   She was one of thousands of people sued in the Recording Industry Association of America's antipiracy campaign, and she refused to settle. Instead, she took her case to national news outlets and became a heroine to supporters of online freedom. An Internet campaign raised about $15,000 for her defense.   The industry eventually dropped its suit against the mother. But it filed a new one against two of her children, Michelle and Robert, ages 20 and 16 at the time.    The new lawsuit said the children had downloaded and distributed more than 1,000 songs, including ''MMMBop'' by Hanson and ''Beat It'' by Michael Jackson.   It said that Michelle had admitted piracy in a deposition and that Robert had been implicated by a family friend. They denied wrongdoing.   Under the terms of the settlement, filed in court in White Plains late Friday, the Santangelos will pay $7,000.   They paid half the amount April 20 and are to make six payments of $583.33 by October.   ''We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the Santangelos,'' Cara Duckworth, a spokeswoman for the R.I.A.A., said in an e-mailed statement. Asked how much had been spent to win the $7,000 settlement, and whether it was a victory, she said, ''We don't break out costs per case, and it's not a question of it being 'worth it' or a 'victory.' ''   She said the lawsuit had succeeded in showing that breaking the law has consequences and in steering music fans toward legal online services ''that fairly compensate musicians and labels.''   Jordan Glass, a lawyer for the family, said the Santangelos had never admitted wrongdoing, and that with both Santangelo children now in college, the settlement offer was accepted to control costs.

"Once Again, France Will Vote on Piracy","A French ''three strikes'' plan for digital piracy is getting its second chance.   As expected, the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy last week revived a proposal to crack down on online piracy by cutting off the Internet connections of people who ignored two warnings to stop unauthorized downloads of copyrighted movies and music. Even though some members of the governing UMP party remain vocal in their opposition to the plan, passage appears likely, given the party's strong parliamentary majority. Still, last month UMP suffered an embarrassment when several lawmakers from the Socialist opposition sneaked into a nearly empty National Assembly at the last moment to outnumber the handful of supporters in the chamber.    ''Artists and the creative industries are massively on our side,'' the culture minister, Christine Albanel said as she introduced the latest version of the bill in the assembly. The same could not be said for some of the lawmakers in the chamber, who interrupted her speech with raucous boos.   Longer-term prospects for the measure remain unclear, analysts say, in part because of a continuing lack of clarity in European Union legislation dealing with such matters. Last week in Brussels, representatives of the European Parliament, the European Commission and E.U. member governments reached a compromise on a measure setting out the terms under which the authorities would be allowed to restrict Internet access.   Some members of Parliament were hoping to use a broad overhaul of European telecommunications legislation to ban proposals like the French one. They proposed adding a provision requiring governments to obtain court orders before cutting off anyone's connection.   But some national governments, including that of France, objected. Under Mr. Sarkozy's ''three strikes'' plan, a government-empowered agency would have the right to cut off Internet access without a court order.   The compromise wording, brokered by a French member of the European Parliament, Catherine Trautmann, said such a judgment must be approved by an ''independent and impartial tribunal.'' That appeared to bring it closer into line with the ''three strikes'' proposal. But how close?   The new wording also calls on the European Commission to ''start a wide public consultation'' on the issue, to ensure that any restrictions on Internet access are imposed in accordance with an E.U. Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.    ''From the standpoint of Parliament, there is still a feeling that this compromise is strong enough to be a threat regarding potential disproportionate solutions,'' said Maxime Herrmann, an assistant to Ms. Trautmann, in a veiled allusion to the plan of Mr. Sarkozy.   The full European Parliament is set to vote on the telecommunications package on Wednesday; if it is approved, the legislation will become a directive, requiring E.U. governments to implement it into law.   The National Assembly is set to vote on Mr. Sarkozy's plan in the coming days, and passage in the other house, the Senate, is assumed. But opponents are watching carefully to see how many members of the governing party vote against it or abstain, saying a large number of dissenters could undermine the credibility of the legislation.   ''If there is no legitimacy to the law, people will have more grounds to fight,'' said Jeremie Zimmermann, director of La Quadrature du Net, an Internet advocacy group in Paris.   Any organized fight aimed at exploiting perceived inconsistencies between French and European Union law through the court system could take a long time.   In the meantime, even if the French bill passes, it could be a while before the procedure for cutting off Internet accounts goes into effect.    Under the proposal, Internet users who installed software to block unauthorized downloads of material would be exempt from the warnings and potential cutoff. Mr. Zimmermann said there was no such software available to consumers now.   The latest version of the bill also includes a measure saying that warnings to pirates could not be sent out until three months after a list of approved software had been published.  "
Woman Linked to Sanford Comments on E-Mail,"Maria Belen Chapur, the Argentine woman linked to South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, said Sunday that she had a ''firm suspicion'' who hacked into an e-mail account of hers that discussed her intimate relationship with the governor, but she declined to name the person, according to a statement read on the Argentine television station CN5.    The letter contained Ms. Chapur's first public words since last week when she was identified as the woman with whom Mr. Sanford was having an affair.   Ms. Chapur said the hacker was not the man mentioned in the e-mail messages, with whom she had ''shared days in Brazil in the Rolex Regatta.'' That friend, she wrote, ''is an excellent, respectable and honorable man incapable of making anything similar to that.''   Ms. Chapur said her Hotmail account was hacked around Nov. 24.    Sometime in that month the hacker sent the messages to both the friend who she spent time with in Brazil, as well as to The State newspaper in Columbia, she said.   In the letter, Ms. Chapur did not mention Mr. Sanford. ''I won't speak about my private life as it just belongs to me,'' she said. ''It has already been made too public during these last days, bringing to me even more pain.'' "
Conviction Is Tossed Out In MySpace Suicide Case,"A federal judge on Thursday threw out the conviction of a Missouri woman on charges of computer fraud for her role in creating a false MySpace account to dupe a teenager, who later committed suicide.    The judge, George H. Wu, said that he was tentatively acquitting the woman, Lori Drew, of misdemeanor counts of gaining access to computers without authorization and that the ruling would be final when he issued his written decision.    In November, a federal jury here convicted Ms. Drew of three misdemeanor charges under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a federal law intended to combat computer crimes. Legal experts followed the case closely, saying it was the first time the statute had been used to prosecute a patron of a social networking site for abuses of the site.     But on Thursday, Judge Wu said the federal statute was too ''vague'' when applied in this case and that were he to allow Ms. Drew's conviction to stand, ''one could literally prosecute anyone who violates a terms of service agreement'' in any way.    The United States attorney in Los Angeles, Thomas P. O'Brien, who brought the case, said a dismissal would leave open the possibility of an appeal. ''Once the decision becomes final,'' he said, ''we'll consider our options.''   Ms. Drew left the courtroom smiling but said nothing.    Prosecutors had sought a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $300,000 fine. In May, probation officials recommended that Ms. Drew be placed on one year of probation and fined $5,000.    Prosecutors said Ms. Drew, with the help of her daughter and a family friend who worked for Ms. Drew, had created a phony identity and MySpace account for a teenage boy, ''Josh Evans,'' on a computer in Ms. Drew's home in suburban St. Louis. According to evidence at the trial, Ms. Drew then used the account to conduct an online courtship with Megan Meier, an emotionally disturbed 13-year-old girl who had once been a friend of her daughter.    One afternoon in October 2006, the evidence showed, Megan received an e-mail message from ''Josh'' that said, ''The world would be a better place without you.'' She shortly wrote back, ''You're the kind of boy a girl would kill herself over,'' and then hanged herself in her bedroom.   Neither Ms. Drew's daughter, Sarah, nor the family friend, Ashley Grills, was charged.    Mr. O'Brien brought the case here, where MySpace keeps its servers, after law enforcement officials in Missouri said Ms. Drew had broken no local laws.    Some experts in cyberbullying and computer fraud criticized  prosecutors for using the computer fraud law against Ms. Drew.    ''This law was designed to criminalize computer hacking, not people going to a Web site and violating terms of service that can be obscure and frankly arbitrary,'' said Matthew L. Levine, a former federal prosecutor and defense lawyer in New York. ''This sets a very bad precedent of using this law for that purpose.''    After Judge Wu announced his decision, a visibly emotional Mr. O'Brien acknowledged that applying the statute ''was a risk.''    ''This was a case that cried out for someone to do something,'' he said.     Ms. Drew's lawyer, Dean Steward, said that prosecutors ''should never have brought these charges'' and that Judge Wu should have thrown the case out when the defense first sought a dismissal eight months ago, before the jury reached its verdict.

Start-Up Plans to Make Journalism Pirates Pay Up,"Online piracy isn't just a problem for music companies; it hurts newspapers and magazines as well. News organizations are now trying to do something about the many Web sites that simply copy articles and paste them into their own pages.   Last week The Associated Press said it would put warnings against copyright violation on its articles and digitally track illegitimate uses. It didn't say what it would do to violators, but it has been quick to use legal means to block reuse of its material.    A start-up called Attributor, based in Redwood City, Calif., is proposing an approach that is more carrot than stick. It has developed an automated way for newspapers to share in the advertising revenue from even the tiniest sites that copy their articles.    The plan faces many technical and legal hurdles. Attributor wants to take some of the ad money that would have been paid to the pirate site and give it to the copyright owner instead. To do that  it needs the cooperation of big advertising networks like those run by Google and Yahoo. So far those companies have reacted coolly to the proposal.    Still, Attributor has been able to attract many major publishing companies to what it calls the Fair Syndication Consortium, which is exploring its ideas. These include The New York Times Company, the Washington Post Company, Hearst, Reuters, Media News Group, McClatchy and Conde Nast.    The Attributor plan ''seems to me to be a way to bring order out of the chaos,'' said Chris Ahearn, president of Reuters Media.    For now those companies have committed only to receiving data from Attributor about how widely their content is being used on Web sites that don't pay for it. Later they will decide whether to proceed with the revenue-sharing plan.   ''We're in 'prove it' mode,'' said Jim Pitkow, the chief executive of Attributor. ''We are going to prove to them piracy is an issue and here is the scale. Then we will take that to the ad networks.''   Mr. Pitkow, a former chief executive of the news aggregation service Moreover Technologies, founded Attributor with Jim Brock, a former Yahoo executive. It has raised $20 million in three rounds of venture capital.   Mr. Pitkow said a study in January of 250,000 articles from 25 publishers showed that on average, each article appeared on 11 unauthorized sites. Looking at traffic data, Attributor calculated that five times as many people read each article on pirate sites as on the site of the publisher. And it estimated that collectively the publishers were losing $250 million a year from unauthorized copying.    Those numbers seem high to many in the Internet business, including  executives of some of the companies working with Attributor.   Lincoln Millstein, Hearst's senior vice president for digital media, said he didn't believe that the company was losing much revenue this way.   ''I don't think it's that big of a problem,'' he said.    Reuters, by contrast, is very concerned. Mr. Ahearn said there was ''tens of millions of dollars worth of inventory that is likely being created that we are not getting our fair share of.''    Attributor's plan rests on the idea that most of these pirate sites depend on networks like Google's AdSense to place ads on their pages and send  them a share of the revenue. Attributor proposes to scan the Web for pages that have articles of participating publishers. It will then notify any network with ads on those pages so the network can share the revenue with the copyright owner.    Mr. Pitkow said this represented the best of all worlds: news organizations get a way to syndicate their work widely and benefit from it, small sites gain legitimate access to professional content, and the networks are able to sell ads on pages that they might otherwise have to pulls ads from if the copyright owner complained.   So far, one small ad network, AdBright, has agreed to Attributor's model. But the larger networks appear to be wary.    Spokesmen for Yahoo and Google said they had not had a chance to review Attributor's proposal in detail. They both noted that they were already supporting news organizations through their policies of removing ads from pages that carried unauthorized copyrighted material.   Mr. Pitkow said he believed the advertising networks would ultimately get on board in the interest of helping out struggling newspapers. But if persuasion doesn't work, he has a threat. Publishers will start to demand that ads be removed from all the pirated pages, a time-consuming and revenue-sapping task.    ''Ad networks that decide not to participate may end up receiving tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of take-down notices a day,'' Mr. Pitkow said. "
British Ruling Makes Hacker's Extradition to U.S. More Likely,"A High Court ruling on Friday brought Britain an important step closer to extraditing a 43-year-old British computer hacker to the United States despite claims by the man's lawyers that he is a harmless eccentric with a form of autism, and not a cyberterrorist, as American prosecutors have asserted.   The man, Gary McKinnon, has admitted that he hacked into dozens of American military computers from his apartment in north London in 2001 and 2002, saying he was looking for information on U.F.O.'s. The latest court ruling rejected his request for a judicial review of a government decision last year approving an American request for his extradition. The court order also rejected his bid to be tried in Britain.    Mr. McKinnon's lawyers have spent seven years in a revolving door of hearings and appeals, all unsuccessful. The new ruling leaves them 28 days to review the court's findings and consider other legal avenues, including a possible bid to Britain's new Supreme Court, which will sit next month for the first time. It will replace the Law Lords, for 150 years Britain's highest appeals court.   But judging from statements made by Mr. McKinnon's lawyers and relatives outside the court in London on Friday, their hopes now focus on political intervention.    A group of 40 British lawmakers has written to President Obama, asking him to step in and ''bring this shameful episode to an end'' on humanitarian grounds.    Prospects for relief from the British government seem meager, since the British home secretary, Alan Johnson,  responded to the new court ruling with a statement reiterating his backing for the extradition.    ''Mr. McKinnon is accused of serious crimes, and the United States has a lawful right to seek his extradition,'' he said.   Mr. McKinnon acknowledges hacking into 97 computers belonging to the United States Defense Department, Navy, Army and Air Force, and NASA in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks. His lawyers and family have said that his actions were influenced by the fact that he has Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism.   But lawyers in Britain seeking his extradition have said his actions were not as benign as he has claimed, and that the diagnosis was made long after the computer hacking occurred, at a time when the legal case was well advanced. Describing him as the most prolific and damaging computer hacker in the history of the United States military, they have maintained that he intended to damage American security by acts of ''intimidation and coercion,'' that he stole more than 1,000 passwords from high-security computer networks and that it cost $700,000 to repair the damage he caused.   They have also said that Mr. McKinnon left a message in one Pentagon computer making clear that his actions were politically motivated. In court, they represented the message as having said: ''U.S. foreign policy is akin to government-sponsored terrorism. I will continue to disrupt at the highest possible level.''   Mr. McKinnon faces eight counts of computer fraud in New Jersey and Virginia, where some of the computer networks he compromised were located. His lawyers and family say he could face a prison sentence of up to 60 years, though American prosecutors have said that he would be likely to get no more than a 10-year sentence. In legal submissions in Britain, the lawyers have argued that Mr. McKinnon should be tried in Britain, where the potential penalties are far less severe, and that he might commit suicide if forced to stand trial in the United States.    His mother, Janis Sharp, said Friday that she feared for his life if he was extradited. ''Gary would not survive, and I would never see my son again,'' she said. ''All to oblige the Americans?''   Britain's National Autistic Society said it was extremely disappointed. ''We are angry that Gary is in this position,'' Amanda Batten, the society's policy chief, said. ''We will continue campaigning and do all we can to support Gary to stay in the U.K.''   The case has prompted an increasingly acrimonious debate over the fairness of a new extradition treaty reached by Britain and the United States in 2003, as part of their efforts to streamline procedures for dealing with terrorism threats.    Mr. McKinnon's supporters say the treaty is one-sided, making it far easier for the United States to extradite people from Britain than the reverse. Legal experts say that the treaty requires the United States to show British courts only that charges have been properly filed against an individual whose extradition it seeks, while Britain has to produce evidence in American courts to support the case it intends to bring against someone it wants returned to Britain.

Online Scammers Target the Jobless,"When Claude Vera responded to the customer-service job opening he saw on the online-classified site Geebo.com back in February, it seemed like one of a hundred small acts that might get him back to work. Most of his e-mail messages to prospective employers were going unanswered, so he was relieved when Penguin Express Inc. replied the next day with a work-from-home job.   To help him get a home office started, Penguin sent him money orders so he could buy, via money wire, the requisite laptop and other equipment from several different people. Mr. Vera, of Jamaica, New York, deposited nine United States Postal Service money orders into his Chase bank account and wired a total of nearly $8,000 to the various vendors. But he never received a laptop or anything else, and the money orders turned out to be already cashed or counterfeit. The scam consumed Mr. Vera's tax refund and  put him in the red by $6,700 to Chase, which  sent his case to a collection agent.    ''Looking back at the whole thing I was very, very naive, but I needed a job so bad,'' he says. ''I'm behind in everything. I'm behind in my rent. I'm behind in all the bills I'm responsible for. It has wiped me out financially.''   With unemployment high and rising, more people are streaming onto the Web in search of jobs -- but running into costly scams. Like job seekers, criminals are after moneymaking opportunities online. And they're setting increasingly sophisticated traps to prey on the desperation of the jobless, whose guards are down amid eroding savings, swelling debts and calamities like foreclosure and bankruptcy. Victims can ill afford another financial setback. ''If you are a con artist, having more people out of work to deal with increases your odds of finding a victim,'' says Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum. ''They are thriving right now. If business weren't good for the scammers, we wouldn't be getting so many complaints.''   Spam filters provide some protection, and job boards work hard to remove bogus offers from large pools of legitimate offers. But none of the technology is foolproof. Job seekers have to keep their wits about them, no matter how much they need a job.   ''The bottom line is if anything seems weird, just don't apply,'' says Tabatha Marshall, founder of PhishBucket.org, a non-profit that tracks online job scams and estimates they're up a third from a year ago. ''You're going to take yourself down a road where you could lose money or time.''   Here are some of the more common scams and tips for avoiding them:   Common Frauds   HELP FOR A FEE Watch out for fake recruiters and charlatans who promise to train you for a lucrative new career. A well-known scam of the latter type is Google Treasure Chest, which offers people a cheap DVD that will teach them how to prosper placing Google ads.   But in the small print of the buyer's agreement is notice of a $72.21 monthly charge. Stopping the charges proves difficult; some people claim to have gotten relief only by changing their credit card numbers. Google Treasure Chest did not reply to requests for comment.   FISHING FOR IDENTITY DATA Ads for attractive white-collar jobs can be, in fact, sophisticated fraud schemes.   Applicants may be steered to an authentic-looking corporate Web site, where they are asked to type personal information into a fake human-resources department Web form. Sometimes scammers go to great lengths, staging phone interviews or sometimes even conference calls with multiple people in an effort to appear legitimate. The goal? To talk people into handing over Social Security and bank-account numbers.   WORK FROM HOME Proliferating recently are fake ''Mystery Shopper'' positions evaluating the services of companies, especially money-wiring services. Victims are typically asked to deposit a check for several thousand dollars into their bank account, immediately use a bit of the money to shop at big-box stores and wire the rest via a service like Western Union or MoneyGram. Of course, the check is counterfeit, leaving victims out any money they wired and opening them to criminal prosecution for passing a bad check.   MONEY-MULE AND RESHIPPER These are some of the most dangerous schemes, since they can turn people, often unwittingly, into accomplices of international crime rings. More sophisticated than the now-familiar Nigerian e-mail messages, money mules are recruited by purported international companies looking for ''receiving payment agents'' who will accept payments into their bank account from ''customers'' (identity fraud victims) and wire the money to their ''employer'' (criminals). Some are told to keep 10 percent, but many are promised payment by direct deposit, which, of course, never comes.   Reshipper scams start with international shipping companies looking for ''logistics managers'' to receive packages of laptops, iPods and cameras, bought with stolen credit cards, and send them on to a foreign country. Again, direct-deposit payment never comes.   How to Protect Yourself    BE SKEPTICAL. Red flags include offers using poor grammar and spelling and that come from e-mail addresses that don't match the name of the company. Real companies use polished language, emphasize a job's duties and use corporate e-mail addresses, not Yahoo or Gmail accounts.   DO YOUR HOMEWORK. Research the company. Do they have a professional Web site with lots of content, a list of executives' names and a phone number where you can reach a human being?   Often a simple Google search will be enough to spot trouble; there are scads of warnings from people who believe they were cheated by Google Treasure Chest, for instance. You can also check companies' reputations with the Better Business Bureau and look for complaints on Web sites like Complaintsboard.com and PhishBucket.org.   KEEP IT PRIVATE. Limit the personal information you give online. This starts with your resume: Don't include any information you wouldn't want broadcast to the world, which is exactly what you're doing. Avoid providing your home address, a key bit of information for perpetrators of identity fraud; most real employers are happy with a general geographic location, like Greater New York City region. Unless you're signing an employment agreement, keep your Social Security number to yourself.   SPECIALIZE YOUR SEARCH. ''If you are in a particular sector or profession, go to the niche site first,'' Ms. Dixon says. Scammers want the volume provided by big sites. Moreover, niche sites often filter job posts by hand and tend to be intimately familiar with the companies posting them, making it easier for them to spot fakes. Look for  industry-specific job boards  or professional groups with online listings.   GET TO KNOW THE COMPANY. During the hiring process, both parties should be looking for a good fit. Craigslist's chief executive, Jim Buckmaster,  says job seekers on his site should, as general rule, ''deal with only local businesses you can meet face to face.'' Mr. Buckmaster says Craigslist's system captures the large majority of scams before they reach the site, but  ''it's virtually impossible to keep every scam from traversing an Internet site that 50 million people are using each month.''    GO LOW TECH. Most people get jobs through local want ads, professional associations, job-search agencies, temp agencies and their personal networks of colleagues, friends and family. ''The old-fashioned way is still sometimes the best way,'' says Linda Foley, a founder of the consumer advocacy Identity Theft Resource Center. "
Chinese Court Jails and Fines Pirates of Windows Software,"A court in eastern China has sentenced four people to prison and ordered payment of about 11 million renminbi ($1.6 million) in fines for distributing pirated versions of Microsoft's Windows XP and other software.    The Business Software Alliance, an industry trade group, lauded the court's decision as the first successful prosecution of large-scale, online software piracy in China. Microsoft likewise applauded the handling of the case.   ''It shows the government is really taking action,'' Liu Fengming, vice president for the greater China region for Microsoft, said in a statement.   Hong Lei, said to be the chief developer of the pirated XP software, and Sun Xiansheng, who managed business promotion for Tomato Garden, the Web site that provided it, each were sentenced to three and a half years in prison, the director of the Huqin District People's Court in Suzhou, a city west of Shanghai, said Friday.   Like many Chinese officials, he would give only his surname, Wang.   Mr. Hong and Mr. Sun were each fined a million renminbi ($146,000), while two others involved in the case received sentences of two years and fines of 100,000 renminbi ($14,600) each, Mr. Wang confirmed.   The court also fined the Chengdu Share Software Net Company, which operated Tomato Garden, more than 8.7 million renminbi ($1.3 million) and confiscated nearly 3 million renminbi ($439,000) of its revenue.   Mr. Hong was detained in August 2008 after authorities received complaints over widespread use of the pirated software, which Tomato Garden distributed free, earning income on advertising only, according to the newspaper Shanghai Daily and other reports.   The reports said that more than 10 million people were thought to have downloaded pirated software from the Web site.   Authorities moved against Tomato Garden after receiving complaints from the Business Software Alliance, the reports said.   ''The verdict of this case represents the end of China's largest online software piracy syndicate and marks a milestone in China's efforts to crack down on Internet piracy,'' the Business Software Alliance said in a statement.

"In France, Intricate Tale Of Corporate Espionage","The story has the elements of a corporate thriller: a cast that includes former French spies and military men, a cycling champion, Greenpeace advocates and a dogged judge whose investigation takes him from a sports doping laboratory outside Paris to a Moroccan jail and  some top French corporations.    Like installments in a serial novel, revelations have been seeping out since March. And while the climax is months away, the story provides  a glimpse into the shadowy business of gathering what corporations call strategic intelligence.    ''For most companies, on a daily basis there are many more things going on than can possibly be handed off to the police,'' said Christian Harbulot, director of the Ecole de Guerre Economique, or School of Economic Warfare, in Paris.    The companies they turn to include  corporate security giants like Kroll  and what Mr. Harbulot  terms ''small operators'' as various as former intelligence agents and computer hackers.     The case unfolding in France involves a mix of computer hackers  and some of the country's biggest companies, including Electricite de France, the world's largest operator of nuclear power plants, and Vivendi, the media and telecommunications giant.    According to a  file compiled by the investigating judge, Thomas Cassuto, investigators stumbled on to the case in the wake of a doping scandal at the Tour de France in 2006.     An American cyclist, Floyd Landis,  was stripped of his title that summer after testing positive for elevated levels of testosterone.  In November 2006, the French antidoping agency filed a complaint claiming that confidential documents related to Mr. Landis's drug tests had been stolen and sent to the news  media and other labs.    The documents had been altered in what lab officials said appeared to have been an effort to discredit them by casting doubt on the handling of test samples. Investigators concluded that one such e-mail message had been sent from a computer using the same Internet protocol address as Arnie Baker, Mr. Landis's coach.   A search of computers in the lab in Chatenay-Malabry, a suburb of Paris, turned up a Trojan horse, a program that allowed an outsider to remotely download files.    No evidence has surfaced to connect Mr. Landis or Mr. Baker to the hacking, and each has  denied any involvement. They did, however,  use  the documents in their unsuccessful effort  to overturn Mr. Landis's cycling ban.   The trail, picked up by a special unit of the French interior ministry, led to a computer specialist named Alain Quiros, who was eventually caught in Mohammedia, Morocco.  Under questioning, Mr. Quiros initially denied any knowledge of the theft but later admitted that he had been paid $2,800 to $4,000 to break into the  testing lab's computers. He identified Thierry Lorho, head of Kargus Consultants, a corporate intelligence company in Paris, as being behind the  computer attack.    Then things got complicated. As the authorities delved into Mr. Quiros's computer, they found a copy of the hard drive of Yannick Jadot, the former campaign director of Greenpeace France, as well as that of Frederik-Karel Canoy, a lawyer and shareholder advocate.   Mr. Lorho, a former French intelligence agent, told  French officials  that another man, Jean-Francois Dominguez,  had paid him for the lab reports.  Both men are being investigated. Mr. Lorho also admitted that he had collected data on Greenpeace on behalf of  Electricite de France, which wanted information on antinuclear campaigners.   Mr. Lorho said that his contacts at  Electricite de France, were  ''perfectly aware'' of the hacking. .    Electricite de France  has denied any knowledge of the theft and has portrayed itself as a victim of illegal acts by Kargus Consultants.  But Judge Cassuto, who took over the investigation in April 2008,  declared Electricite de France,  an ''assisted witness,'' one step short of being  under formal investigation.  Alexis Gublin, a lawyer representing   the company, said  it was cooperating with the inquiry.   Through their lawyers, Mr. Quiros, Mr. Dominguez and Mr. Lorho declined to comment.    Spying by corporations is not new. In the mid-1960s, General Motors used private detectives to dig up information on Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, when he began to criticize the auto industry's safety record. In the last  two years, some of the biggest companies in Germany, including Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Bank, have been caught overstepping the line regarding surveillance.   The investigation into  Electricite de France,  which is 85 percent owned by the French government, has touched a nerve in France, whose intelligence agents bombed and sank the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in 1985 in Auckland, New Zealand, killing a photographer. But  no evidence  suggests that the French government was aware of or involved in the hacking.    In an interview with an intelligence Web site, Lerenseignement.com, Mr. Lorho said he assumed ''full responsibility'' for hacking the Greenpeace computer, but he added that ''I would like to see E.D.F., which sponsored the operation, take responsibility for its part.''   On April 10,  Electricite de France  said that it had ended its relationship with Kargus Consultants and had temporarily removed  two  security employees who had been dealing with the firm. The two  --  Pierre-Paul Francois, a site protection engineer and former police officer, and his superior, Pascal Durieux, a security manager and former French Navy admiral -- are under  investigation by Judge Cassuto.  Each maintains his innocence.   Electricite de France  defended its need to monitor advocacy groups.   ''It's important to know, for example, if this or that group is in the radical extreme or if it is above board,'' Jean-Marc Sabathe, the company's security director, said in an April interview with Le Monde. ''But we have no need to pay hackers to find out.''    Meanwhile, the investigation continues.    In the doping lab case, Mr. Dominguez, who has been described in the French media as a photographer with links to French intelligence, told investigators that he had acted only as a middleman, passing data he received from Kargus to another man, who has not been found.    Judge Cassuto summoned Mr. Landis and Mr. Baker to Paris in May for questioning, but neither appeared for the hearing. Mr. Landis did not respond to requests for comment through Team Ouch, his new cycle racing squad. But he told Cycling News in November 2006, when rumors of the hacking  surfaced, that ''any claims attributing these actions to me or my defense team are baseless, untrue, irresponsible and another example of the character assassination that I have faced.''   In a recent e-mail message,  Mr. Baker denied any involvement in the hacking.    Since 2002, Mr. Canoy, the shareholder advocate,  has filed 13 lawsuits against Vivendi, which has filed two countersuits, Antoine Lefort, a spokesman for Vivendi, said.    Mr. Harbulot, the specialist in  economic intelligence, said the most curious thing about the  case was why a company like Electricite de France  would get involved with ''these kinds of people.''    ''All of E.D.F.'s security needs should be taken care of by the state, because it's strategically important,'' he said.  "
Britain Considers Steps to Halt Online Piracy,"The British government said on Tuesday that it might require Internet service providers to fight illegal copying of music and movies by suspending the accounts of online pirates.   The new approach, similar to proposals in France, follows complaints from the music and movie industries that the British authorities are not doing enough to curb illegal file-sharing. In June, the government proposed softer antipiracy measures, including slowing down broadband service of consumers found to be pirating material, but stopped short of calls to block access.    ''Some stakeholders have argued strongly that none of those technical measures is powerful enough to have a significant deterrent effect on infringing behavior,'' the revised proposal says.   The proposal was made in a revision to the June recommendations, published as part of the government's strategy for the digital economy, and will be open to public comment until the end of September before any legislation is introduced.   But suspending service is a highly controversial subject. Business and personal communications are increasingly shifting to the Internet, and governments have outlined plans to make broadband a universal service, like electricity or running water.   Fiercely opposed by advocates of an unfettered Internet, the French plan has faced legislative and judicial hurdles. It  has yet to be adopted nearly two years after it was proposed by President Nicolas Sarkozy.   Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, which campaigns against Internet restrictions, said the British government seemed ''intent on heavy-handed intervention.''   ''This would be in direct contravention of their own goal of universal broadband access, as well as a curtailment of people's freedom of expression,'' he said in a statement.   But groups representing copyright owners welcomed the government's new proposals.   ''Digital piracy is a serious problem and a real threat to the U.K.'s creative industries,'' said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of BPI, an organization representing British record labels. ''The solution to the piracy problem must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.'' "
"2,000-Year-Old Scrolls, Internet-Era Crime","E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com Early one morning in March, the law banged on the door of an apartment on Thompson Street in Greenwich Village. Investigators had a warrant to arrest Raphael Haim Golb and seize his computer. He was caught red-handed.   Mr. Golb is, or was, a guerrilla fighter in a cyberbrawl over the Dead Sea Scrolls, a war about the origins of 2,000-year-old documents that has consumed the energy of academics around the globe.   He was being arrested for fighting dirty.    Mr. Golb is 49 years old and had 50 e-mail aliases. He used pseudonyms to post on blogs. Under the name of a professor he was trying to undermine, prosecutors charged, Mr. Golb wrote a quasi confession  to plagiarism and circulated it among students and officials at New York University.    His purpose, the Manhattan district attorney's office said, was ''to influence and affect debate on the Dead Sea Scrolls, and in order to harass Dead Sea Scrolls scholars who disagree with his viewpoint.''   In the classic 1993 New Yorker cartoon by Peter Steiner, two dogs are perched in front of a computer screen. ''On the Internet,'' one says to the other, ''nobody knows you're a dog.''   For a while, no one knew that 50 different names in the Dead Sea Scrolls debate were the prolific Mr. Golb, a graduate of Oberlin College who has a law degree from New York University and a doctorate in comparative literature from Harvard (dissertation: ''The Problems of Privacy and Trust in Modern Literature, and their Relation to the Idea of Freedom'').   In court papers filed last week, Mr. Golb's lawyers argued that prosecutors were trying to criminalize the commonplace. Both sides in the Dead Sea Scrolls debate, they said, use ''sock puppets'' -- fake identities -- on the Internet to make it seem as if scores of people are arguing a point.    ''These bloggers marshaled their legion of sock puppets to engage in intellectual combat with the sock puppets allegedly created by Raphael Golb and others,'' the lawyers wrote.    No other creatures in the animal kingdom behave like this, not when the stakes are lower than food or mating or survival. And here's a bonus: a thread of the Shakespearean runs through the case.    Mr. Golb's father is Norman Golb, a professor at the University of Chicago and a critic of claims that the Dead Sea Scrolls were the work of a sect called the Essenes, thought to have lived near the Qumran caves where the scrolls were found. Professor Golb has suggested that the scrolls were actually the product of several libraries in Jerusalem and were taken to the caves around the time the city fell to the Romans in the year 70. This is not a dispute for the fainthearted. Golb the Son has taken up his father's cause with all the vigor permitted by multiple Gmail accounts.    When he was arrested, Mr. Golb was asked by prosecutors if he wrote under the name ''Charles Gadda,'' one of the most visible Internet advocates for his father. He would not answer directly.   ''They would say that my father is doing it or asking me to do it,'' Mr. Golb said, according to court papers. ''My father certainly never asked me to do anything of the kind.''   But he allowed that ''Charles Gadda'' was doing pretty well. ''Do you realize that the Charles Gadda articles have been read by thousands of people?'' Mr. Golb continued. ''I know that, because I look at them, it says on them.''   The Internet is, of course, both gold mine and sludge pile, where people lie about their ages, their abilities, the world. The prosecutors say that by adopting all those false identities, Mr. Golb was trying to obtain a benefit, and so committed criminal impersonation, identity theft and aggravated harassment. But Mr. Golb's lawyers maintain that there was no tangible benefit, and therefore no crime.   ''Gaining an advantage in academic debate about the Dead Sea Scrolls is not the kind of benefit required by the law,'' said Ronald Kuby, one of the defense lawyers.   But what about the injury Mr. Golb apparently tried to inflict on Lawrence H. Schiffman, the chairman of Judaic studies at N.Y.U.? Someone wrote from larry.schiffman@gmail.com to Professor Schiffman's  graduate students and dean, alerting them to an article that suggested he  had committed plagiarism. Perhaps two things go without saying: The article was actually written under one of Raphael Golb's pseudonyms, and Professor Schiffman has been critical of the theories of Golb pere.    The defense claims that the e-mail messages were transparent parodies, and that in any event, injury to a reputation is a civil matter, not a criminal violation.   ''He writes letters in my names in which I am admitting to horrendous offenses,'' Professor Schiffman  said  Friday. ''This is the rough-and-tumble of the Internet?''    That 1993 cartoon could use an update. On the Internet today, everybody knows you're a dog. "
Hacked E-Mail Is New Fodder for Climate Dispute,"Hundreds of private e-mail messages and documents hacked from a computer server at a British university are causing a stir among global warming skeptics, who say they show that climate scientists conspired to overstate the case for a human influence on climate change.   The e-mail messages, attributed to prominent American and British climate researchers, include discussions of scientific data and whether it should be released, exchanges about how best to combat the arguments of skeptics, and casual comments -- in some cases derisive -- about specific people known for their skeptical views. Drafts of scientific papers and a photo collage that portrays climate skeptics on an ice floe were also among the hacked data, some of which dates back 13 years.   In one e-mail exchange, a scientist writes of using a statistical ''trick'' in a chart illustrating a recent sharp warming trend. In another, a scientist refers to climate skeptics as ''idiots.''   Some skeptics asserted Friday that the correspondence revealed an effort to withhold scientific information. ''This is not a smoking gun; this is a mushroom cloud,'' said Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist who has long faulted evidence pointing to human-driven warming and is criticized in the documents.     Some of the correspondence portrays the scientists as feeling under siege by the skeptics' camp and worried that any stray comment or data glitch could be turned against them.    The evidence pointing to a growing human contribution to global warming is so widely accepted that the hacked material is unlikely to erode the overall argument. However, the documents will undoubtedly raise questions about the quality of research on some specific questions and the actions of some scientists.    In several e-mail exchanges, Kevin Trenberth, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other scientists discuss gaps in understanding of recent variations in temperature. Skeptic Web sites pointed out one line in particular: ''The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't,'' Dr. Trenberth wrote.   The cache of e-mail messages also includes references to journalists, including this reporter, and queries from journalists related to articles they were reporting.    Officials at the University of East Anglia confirmed in a statement on Friday that files had been stolen from a university server and that the police had been brought in to investigate the breach. They added, however, that they could not confirm that all the material circulating on the Internet was authentic.    But several scientists and others contacted by The New York Times confirmed that they were the authors or recipients of specific e-mail messages included in the file. The revelations are bound to inflame the public debate as hundreds of negotiators prepare to negotiate an international climate accord at meetings in Copenhagen next month, and at least one scientist speculated that the timing was not coincidental.    Dr. Trenberth said Friday that he was appalled at the release of the e-mail messages.   But he added that he thought the revelations might backfire against climate skeptics. He said that he thought that the messages showed ''the integrity of scientists.'' Still, some of the comments might lend themselves to being interpreted as sinister.    In a 1999 e-mail exchange about charts showing climate patterns over the last two millenniums, Phil Jones, a longtime climate researcher at the East Anglia Climate Research Unit, said he had used a ''trick'' employed by another scientist, Michael Mann, to ''hide the decline'' in temperatures.   Dr. Mann, a professor at Pennsylvania State University, confirmed in an interview that the e-mail message was real. He said the choice of words by his colleague was poor but noted that scientists often used the word ''trick'' to refer to a good way to solve a problem, ''and not something secret.''   At issue were sets of data, both employed in two studies. One data set showed long-term temperature effects on tree rings;  the other, thermometer readings for the past 100 years.    Through the last century, tree rings and thermometers show a consistent rise in temperature until 1960, when some tree rings, for unknown reasons, no longer show that rise, while the thermometers continue to do so until the present.    Dr. Mann explained that the reliability of the tree-ring data was called into question, so they were no longer used to track temperature fluctuations. But he said dropping the use of the tree rings was never something that was hidden, and had been in the scientific literature for more than a decade. ''It sounds incriminating, but when you look at what you're talking about, there's nothing there,'' Dr. Mann said.   In addition, other independent but indirect measurements of temperature fluctuations in the studies broadly agreed with the thermometer data showing rising temperatures.    Dr. Jones, writing in an e-mail message, declined to be interviewed.    Stephen McIntyre, a blogger who on his Web site, climateaudit.org, has for years been challenging data used to chart climate patterns, and who came in for heated criticism in some e-mail messages, called the revelations ''quite breathtaking.''   But several scientists whose names appear in the e-mail messages said they merely revealed that scientists were human, and did nothing to undercut the body of research on global warming. ''Science doesn't work because we're all nice,'' said Gavin A. Schmidt, a climatologist at NASA whose e-mail exchanges with colleagues over a variety of climate studies were in the cache. ''Newton may have been an ass, but the theory of gravity still works.''   He said the breach at the University of East Anglia was discovered after hackers who had gained access to the correspondence sought Tuesday to hack into a different server supporting realclimate.org, a blog unrelated to NASA that he runs with several other scientists pressing the case that global warming is true.    The intruders sought to create a mock blog post there and to upload the full batch of files from Britain. That effort was thwarted, Dr. Schmidt said, and scientists immediately notified colleagues at the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit. The first posts that revealed details from the files appeared Thursday at The Air Vent, a Web site devoted to skeptics' arguments.     At first, said Dr. Michaels, the climatologist who has faulted some of the science of the global warming consensus, his instinct was to ignore the correspondence as ''just the way scientists talk.''    But on Friday, he said that after reading more deeply, he felt that some exchanges reflected an effort to block the release of data for independent review.    He said some messages mused about discrediting him by challenging the veracity of his doctoral dissertation at the University of Wisconsin by claiming he knew his research was wrong. ''This shows these are people willing to bend rules and go after other people's reputations in very serious ways,'' he said.   Spencer R. Weart, a physicist and historian who is charting the course of research on global warming, said the hacked material would serve as ''great material for historians.'' "
Hacked E-Mail Data Prompts Calls for Changes in Climate Research,"Some prominent climate scientists are calling for changes in the way research on global warming is conducted after a British university said thousands of private e-mail messages and documents had been stolen from its climate center.   The scientists say that the e-mail messages, which have circulated on the Internet and which disclose the inner workings of a small network of climatologists who chart the planet's temperature, have damaged the public's trust in the evidence that humans are dangerously warming the planet, just as many countries are poised to start reining in greenhouse gas emissions.   ''This whole concept of, 'We're the experts, trust us,' has clearly gone by the wayside with these e-mails,'' said Judith Curry, a climate scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology.   She and other scientists are seeking more transparency in the way climate data is handled and in the methods used to analyze it. And they argue that scientists should re-evaluate the selection procedures used by some scientific journals and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the panel that in 2007 concluded that humans were the dominant force driving warming and whose findings underpin international discussions over a new climate treaty.    A fierce debate over the significance of the hacked material erupted as soon as the e-mail messages and other documents surfaced on Web sites just over a week ago. Some see in the e-mail correspondence -- which includes heated discussions about warming trends, advice on deleting potentially controversial e-mail messages and derisive comments about climate skeptics -- evidence of a conspiracy to stifle dissenting views and withhold data from public scrutiny, or, as some have put it, ''Climategate.''    To others, the e-mail messages are merely evidence that climate scientists can be as competitive, proprietary, defensive and caustic as people engaged in any other high-level enterprise. They cast as villains those who disclosed the e-mail correspondence and who now, they say,  are distorting the contents   Gavin A. Schmidt, a NASA climatologist involved in many of the e-mail exchanges, said that voluntarily disclosing more data would never satisfy the ''very hard-bitten, distraught core'' of climate skeptics. ''The number of attacks on our integrity will actually increase since there will be more ways to twist what it is we do to support some conspiracy theory or other,'' he said.    Officials at the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia in Britain say the disclosed material was copied from computers there in a ''criminal breach.'' (Some e-mail exchanges involved or described this reporter and other journalists).   On Friday, scientists at the university said the school was preparing to announce an inquiry, led by an independent panel, into the theft and related issues.    The most serious criticisms leveled at the authors of the e-mail messages revolve around three issues.    One is whether the correspondence reveals efforts by scientists to shield raw data, gleaned from tree rings and other indirect indicators of climate conditions, preventing it from being examined by independent researchers. Among those who say it does is Stephen McIntyre, a retired Canadian mining consultant who has a popular skeptics' blog, climateaudit.org.  A second issue is whether disclosed documents, said to be from the stolen cache, prove that the data underlying climate scientists' conclusions about warming are murkier than the scientists have said. The documents include files of raw computer code and a computer programmer's years-long log documenting his frustrations over data gathered from countries in the Northern Hemisphere.    Finally, questions have been raised about whether the e-mail messages indicated that climate scientists tried to prevent the publication of papers written by climate skeptics, which were described by the scientists in the e-mail messages as ''garbage'' and ''fraud.''    Officials with Britain's national climate office have defended the integrity of the climate unit's work, noting that the warming trend it has measured is largely replicated by separate groups at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ''This is a shallow and transparent attempt to discredit the robust science undertaken by some of the world's most respected scientists,'' said Vicky Pope, the office's senior spokeswoman, in an e-mail message.   Rajendra K. Pachauri, the chairman of the intergovernmental climate panel, issued a statement rebutting claims that the e-mail messages, which involved some members of the panel, indicated that the panel's reports were biased. In posts on the blog Realclimate.org, some of the scientists who participated in the correspondence have also said that, although inappropriate language was used at times, their critical comments about people or research papers were based on the quality of the arguments.    The public disclosure of the e-mail messages has already led to calls from conservative British and American legislators for investigations.    The lead Saudi Arabian climate negotiator, Mohammad al-Sabban, said that the affair could affect negotiations over a new global climate treaty. ''This is very serious and can put the whole climate debate, including any future agreement in Copenhagen and beyond, in big question,'' Mr. al-Sabban said in an e-mail message. And even some environmental campaigners believe that the disclosures have damaged calls for climate action. George Monbiot, a British environmentalist and author, excoriated some of the climate unit's scientists and many of his fellow activists on Wednesday in a column in The Guardian.   ''No one has been as badly let down by the revelations in these emails as those of us who have championed the science,'' he wrote. ''We should be the first to demand that it is unimpeachable, not the last.''   Mike Hulme, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia and author of ''Why We Disagree About Climate Change,'' said the disclosures could offer a chance to finally bring the practices of climate researchers and the intergovernmental panel into the modern era, where transparency -- enforced legally or illegally -- is inevitable and appropriate.    ''The I.P.C.C. itself, through its structural tendency to politicize climate change science, has perhaps helped to foster a more authoritarian and exclusive form of knowledge production,'' he said in an e-mail message, ''just at a time when a globalizing and wired cosmopolitan culture is demanding of science something much more open and inclusive.''    Dr. Curry and others said that if nothing else, the e-mail correspondence suggested that climate scientists needed to show more temperance in dealing with their critics.    ''We won the war -- the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize, and climate and energy legislation is near the top of the U.S. agenda,'' Dr. Curry said. ''Why keep fighting all these silly battles and putting ourselves in this position?'' "
"Stolen E-Mail, Stoking the Climate Debate","The public editor can be reached by e-mail: public@nytimes.com AS world leaders prepare to meet tomorrow in Copenhagen to address global warming, skeptics are pointing to e-mail hacked from a computer server at a British university as evidence that the conference may be much ado about nothing. They say the e-mail messages show a conspiracy among scientists to overstate human influence on the climate -- and some accuse The Times of mishandling the story.   Although The Times was among the first to report on the e-mail, in a front-page article late last month, and has continued to write about the issue almost daily in the paper or on its Web site, readers have raised a variety of complaints:   Some say Andrew Revkin, the veteran environmental reporter who is covering what skeptics have dubbed ''Climategate,'' has a conflict of interest because he wrote or is mentioned in some of the e-mail messages that the University of East Anglia says were stolen. Others wondered why The Times did not make the e-mail available on its Web site, and scoffed at an explanation by Revkin in a blog post that they contain ''private information and statements that were never intended for the public eye.'' What about the Pentagon Papers? they asked.    Others contended that The Times was playing down a story with global implications, coming as world leaders consider a treaty to limit the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere from autos, power plants and other sources.   Luis Alvarez Jr. of Charlottesville, Va., was outraged that a front-page article on President Obama's pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States had not a single mention of the e-mail, in which one scientist, for example, said he had used a ''trick'' to ''hide'' a recent decline in temperatures.   Richard Murphy of Fairfield, Conn., said, ''Given that the hacked e-mails cast doubt on some of the critical research that underlies the entire global warming argument, I am astounded that The Times has treated the issue in such a cavalier fashion.''   Does Revkin have a conflict of interest, as Steven Milloy, the publisher of JunkScience.com, and others contended? Why didn't The Times put the e-mail on its Web site? And, most important, is The Times being cavalier about a story that could change our understanding of global warming? Or, as The Times's John Broder, who covers environmental issues in Washington, put it, ''When does a story rise to three-alarm coverage?''   Erica Goode, the environment editor, said that as soon as she learned that Revkin was mentioned in the scientists' e-mail, she consulted with Philip Corbett, the standards editor. She said she read the roughly one dozen messages containing Revkin's name and decided they showed a reporter asking for information for news articles, with ''no particular close relationship with the scientists other than the fact that he knew them.'' Goode and Corbett said they agreed that Revkin did not have a significant conflict and was good to go, with an acknowledgment in the article that he and other journalists were named in the e-mail.   I read all the messages involving Revkin, and I did not see anything to keep him off the story. If anything, there was an indication that the scientists whom some readers accused Revkin of being too cozy with were wary of his independence. One, Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University, warned a colleague, Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit at East Anglia, to be careful what he shared with ''Andy'' because, ''He's not as predictable as we'd like.''   As for not posting the e-mail, Revkin said he should have used better language in his blog, Dot Earth, to explain the decision, which was driven by advice from a Times attorney. The lawyer, George Freeman, told me that there is a large legal distinction between government documents like the Pentagon Papers, which The Times published over the objections of the Nixon administration, and e-mail between private individuals, even if they may receive some government money for their work.  He said the Constitution protects the publication of leaked government information, as long as it is newsworthy and the media did not obtain it illegally. But the purloined e-mail, he said, was covered by copyright law in the United States and Britain.    I think that any notion that The Times was trying to avoid publishing the e-mail messages is a manufactured issue. On Freeman's advice, the paper linked to them -- on a skeptic's Web site as it happens -- and they were a click away for anyone who wanted to examine them.   The biggest question is what the messages amount to -- an embarrassing revelation that scientists can be petty and defensive and even cheat around the edges, or a major scandal that undercuts the scientific premise for global warming. The former is a story. The latter is a huge story. And the answer is tied up in complex science that is difficult even for experts to understand, and in politics in which passionate sides have been taken, sometimes regardless of the facts.   John Tierney, a Times science columnist, explained in Science Times last week the most controversial revelation so far in the e-mail -- Jones's effort to ''hide the decline'' when preparing a graph for the cover of a report to be read by policy makers. The graph, showing sharply higher temperatures in the last several decades, relied in part on tree ring data, until the rings began to diverge from thermometer readings and show a decline in temperatures. Jones and his colleagues did not believe that data and removed it from the graph, substituting direct thermometer readings without explicitly acknowledging the switch.   ''The story behind that graph certainly didn't show that global warming was a hoax or a fraud, as some skeptics proclaimed,'' Tierney wrote, ''but it did illustrate another of their arguments: that the evidence for global warming is not as unequivocal as many scientists claim.''   Revkin said last week on his blog that he was asking a variety of researchers if the e-mail changed our understanding of global warming. One, Roger Pielke Sr. of the University of Colorado, who has been critical of what he called ''the climate oligarchy,'' including some of the scientists involved in the e-mail, replied that it did not. Pielke has characterized some scientists in the field as inbred and wedded to their views, but he said that the temperature measurement by Jones's group was only one of several showing a long-term warming trend, and that there was no doubt that carbon dioxide produced by humans was a major factor.   But Revkin and Tierney both told me that, after that broad understanding among scientists, there is sharp debate over how fast the earth is warming, how much human activity is contributing and how severe the impact will be.   ''Our coverage, looked at in toto, has never bought the catastrophe conclusion and always aimed to examine the potential for both overstatement and understatement,'' Revkin said.    Goode, his editor, said: ''We here at The Times are not scientists. We don't collect the data or analyze it, and so the best we can do is to give our readers a sense of what the prevailing scientific view is, based on interviews with scientists'' and the expertise of reporters like Revkin.    So far, I think The Times has handled Climategate appropriately -- a story, not a three-alarm story. "
Appeal to Obama From British Hacker's Mother,"Updated | 1:42 p.m. Janis Sharp, the mother of British computer hacker Gary McKinnon, appealed on British television to President Barack Obama on Friday to intervene in her son's case. Mr. McKinnon faces extradition to the United States to face charges of having broken into Pentagon and NASA computers to look for information on UFOs.  Ms. Sharp spoke to reporters outside the High Court in London after Mr. McKinnon lost a legal appeal against an extradition order. The BBC published this video of Ms. Sharp's plea on behalf of her son, who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. Earlier this week, Mr. McKinnon told the BBC that he had been on a ""moral crusade"" to prove that the United States had found an alien spacecraft that ran on clean fuel. As my colleague John Burns reports from London on Friday, ""Mr. McKinnon acknowledges hacking into 97 computers"" belonging to the belonging to the U.S. military and NASA in 2001 and 2002. In his defense, Mr. McKinnon said this week on BBC Radio: I'm not blind to criminality but I was on a moral crusade at the time. There was good evidence to show that certain secretive parts of the American government intelligence agencies did have access to crashed extra terrestrial technology which could... save us as a form of free, clean, pollution-free energy. Britain's Channel 4 News broadcast the video report on Mr. McKinnon's case embedded above on Friday, and published a timeline of the major events in his long legal struggle to avoid extradition on its Web site. As The Associated Press reports, an American grand jury in Virginia indicted Mr. McKinnon in 2002 on seven counts of computer-related crimes, adding that ""Paul McNulty, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said McKinnon was charged with 'the biggest military computer hack of all time.' "" Last year, The Lede discussed Mr. McKinnon's case in three posts by your former Supreme Leder, Mike Nizza, which included links to interviews and articles about the long-running battle by the avowed hacker to avoid being extradited from Britain. In her remarks today, Ms. Sharp argued that the American government could not have considered Mr. McKinnon to be as big a threat as the legal briefs in the case claimed, since Washington waited several years after he was caught to ask for his extradition: ""Gary was left to use computers from March 2002 to June 2005. If he was so dangerous, would he have been left with his computers?""  Ms. Sharp also said: ""I think Obama probably doesn't know about it, and he's got so many things to consider, but I'm really desperately trying to get through to Obama, because this is from the Bush era, it's a holdover from the Bush era. It's not of Obama. He would not want this to happen."" As Ms. Sharp pointed out, the campaign to free Mr. McKinnon has been boosted by a new cover version of the Crosby Stills Nash & Young protest song ""Chicago,"" this time featuring Chrissie Hynde, David Gilmour, Bob Geldof and the hacker himself, which supporters can purchase online to aid his defense. Here is a recent video report from ITN in London about the recording of the song, which includes interviews with Mr. McKinnon, Ms. Sharp and Ms. Hynde: The Guardian reported on Friday that Mr. McKinnon's lawyer says that he fears for his client's mental health if he ends up in a U.S. federal penitentiary: ""His barrister, Edward Fitzgerald, said McKinnon could suffer a psychotic breakdown or become suicidal if he faced trial or imprisonment in the United States."" In an interview with ITN on Friday, Shami Chakrabarti of the British civil-liberties group Liberty, which condemned the new ruling against Mr. McKinnon, said that Britain's current extradition law, passed after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, needs to be changed:  "
Inhofe Seeks Probe of Climate Science,"After hackers obtained and disclosed the e-mail correspondence of numerous prominent climate scientists last week, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the most outspoken global warming skeptic in Congress, said Tuesday that he'd begun an investigation into what he alleges to be the manipulation of global warming research.   He also said he wanted to look into whether  the conclusions of an international panel on global warming - and the policies based on it - were distorted.  Mr. Inhofe, the senior Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, sent letters to many of the scientists whose e-mail messages were made public and to a number of United States government agencies, asking them to preserve all correspondence as the first step in his inquiry. The thousands of messages, some dating back more than a decade, shed unflattering light on a number of scientists who harshly questioned the scholarship and motives of other scientists who expressed some doubts about the causes and extent of global climate change. The e-mail messages also appear to chronicle efforts to keep skeptical scientific opinions out of major journals and to prevent their inclusion in the studies of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body that has provided the leading technical and scientific work on global warming. The I.P.C.C. two years ago declared the existence of dangerous man-made global warming to be ""unequivocal"" and the group's conclusions have formed the basis of much subsequent research and government policy. Mr. Inhofe alleges that much of the body's work has now been called into question. ""The stakes in this controversy are significant, as it appears that the basis of federal programs, pending E.P.A. rulemakings, and cap-and-trade legislation was contrived and fabricated,"" Senator Inhofe said. ""I certainly don't condone the manner in which these e-mails were released; however, now that they are in the public domain, lawmakers have an obligation to determine the extent to which the so-called 'consensus' of global warming, formed with billions of taxpayer dollars, was contrived in the biased minds of the world's leading climate scientists,"" Mr. Inhofe said in a press release. Scientists still overwhelmingly believe in human-caused climate change, but the newly-revealed e-mails have put many leading climate scientists on the defensive and are likely to spark weeks of vigorous scientific and public debate.

Chinese Court Convicts 11 in Microsoft Piracy Case,"A court in southern China convicted 11 people on Wednesday of violating national copyright laws and participating in a sophisticated counterfeiting ring that for years manufactured and distributed pirated Microsoft software throughout the world.   The men were sentenced by a court in the city of Shenzhen to terms of 18 months to six and a half years in prison, according to court papers released late Wednesday.    Microsoft applauded the sentence in a statement released late Wednesday Beijing time, saying they were the stiffest sentences ever handed down in this type of Chinese copyright infringement case.    Microsoft has called the group part of ''the biggest software counterfeiting organization we have ever seen, by far'' and estimated its global sales at more than $2 billion.    Some legal specialists consider the case  to be a landmark because it involved a joint antipiracy effort by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Chinese Ministry of Public Security. Law enforcement officials said it was also notable because the group operated like a multinational corporation, producing and distributing high-quality counterfeit software that was created and packaged almost identically to the real products, despite Microsoft's antipiracy measures.   The counterfeit goods, like  Windows XP and Office 2007, were sold over the Internet and shipped from China, mostly to the United States and Europe, where they commanded relatively high prices, investigators say. American and Chinese officials say they broke up the criminal ring in July 2007 with the arrest of 25 people in China, the dismantling of several manufacturing facilities and the confiscation of counterfeit software valued at more than $500 million.   ''This is absolutely unprecedented,'' David Finn,  Microsoft's associate general counsel for worldwide piracy and counterfeiting issues, said. ''The size and scope of the operation is unlike anything we've seen before. We found their products in 36 countries.''    A separate trial involving nine  suspects in Shanghai has not yet reached a verdict. That group has been accused of counterfeiting Microsoft and Symantec software and distributing it worldwide.   Legal specialists say that software pirates are becoming increasingly sophisticated and that the two court cases show that China is  capable of exporting high-quality, fully packaged software that could easily be sold as if it were the real thing. Even customs officials have been fooled by the counterfeits, which contained hologram markings and Microsoft's difficult-to-replicate ''certificates of authenticity,'' investigators say.    Counterfeiting experts say the ring appeared to be less interested in selling its products inside China, where counterfeit Microsoft software can be purchased for as little as $3. It sought the higher-value export market.   Microsoft said its 75-member antipiracy team had been tracking the ring since 2001. The F.B.I. began its operation, code-named Summer Solstice, in 2005 and cooperated with Chinese officials.    American politicians and corporate executives have been pressing China for years to crack down on piracy and intellectual property rights abuses that included music, film and expensive software products. Software piracy is rampant in China, where about 80 percent of computers are believed to use counterfeit software, according to the Business Software Alliance.   The counterfeiting has caused some friction between American and Chinese officials, but China insists that  it  has made significant progress in its fight against intellectual property violators. The successful prosecution of one of the biggest software counterfeiting rings is seen by the government as a major breakthrough.   Shenzhen officials declined to comment Wednesday  on the court verdict. While the F.B.I. and Chinese officials say hundreds of millions of dollars worth of material were seized in a variety of international raids, the Shenzhen court found on Wednesday that the suspects on trial there had sold less than $200,000 worth of counterfeit products overseas.    It is unclear whether others pocketed much greater sums or whether many more ringleaders are still at large.   Most of those convicted Wednesday had completed only middle school, according to court documents. But members of the group had access to one of China's biggest disk manufacturing companies in Shenzhen through the use of fake licenses, court papers said.    The counterfeit Microsoft software was produced using manufacturing equipment that costs millions of dollars, investigators said, and appeared in English, German, Italian, Korean, Spanish as well as other languages. The Chinese government found warehouses filled with molding machines, gilding machines, sealing machines and air compressors. "
"Despite News Reports, Task Force Finds Online Threat to Children Overblown","The Internet may not be such a dangerous place for children after all.   A task force created by 49 state attorneys general to look into the problem of sexual solicitation of children online has concluded that there really is not a significant problem.    The findings ran counter to popular perceptions of online dangers as reinforced by depictions in the news media like NBC's ''To Catch a Predator'' series. One attorney general was quick to criticize the group's report.    The panel, the Internet Safety Technical Task Force, was charged with examining the extent of the threats children face on social networks like MySpace and Facebook, amid widespread fears that adults were using these popular Web sites to deceive and prey on children.    But the report concluded that the problem of bullying among children, both online and offline, poses a far more serious challenge than the sexual solicitation of minors by adults.    ''This shows that social networks are not these horribly bad neighborhoods on the Internet,'' said John Cardillo, chief executive of Sentinel Tech Holding, which maintains a sex offender database and  was part of the task force. ''Social networks are very much like real-world communities that are comprised mostly of good people who are there for the right reasons.''   The 278-page report, released Tuesday, was the result of a year of meetings between dozens of academics, experts in childhood safety and executives of 30 companies, including Yahoo, AOL, MySpace and Facebook.   The task force, led by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, looked at scientific data on online sexual predators and found that children and teenagers were unlikely to be propositioned by adults online. In the cases that do exist, the report said, teenagers are typically willing participants and are already at risk because of poor home environments, substance abuse or other problems.    Not everyone was happy with the conclusions. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, who has forcefully pursued the issue and helped to create the task force, said he disagreed with the report. Mr. Blumenthal said it ''downplayed the predator threat,'' relied on outdated research and failed to provide a specific plan for improving the safety of social networking.    ''Children are solicited every day online,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''Some fall prey, and the results are tragic. That harsh reality defies the statistical academic research underlying the report.''   In what social networks may view as something of an exoneration after years of pressure from law enforcement, the report said sites like MySpace and Facebook ''do not appear to have increased the overall risk of solicitation.''   Attorneys general like Mr. Blumenthal and Roy Cooper of North Carolina publicly accused the social networks of facilitating the activities of pedophiles and pushed them to adopt measures to protect their youngest users. Citing studies that showed tens of thousands of convicted sex offenders were using MySpace, they pressured the networks to purge those people from their membership databases.    The attorneys general also charged the task force with evaluating technologies that might play a role in enhancing safety for children online. An advisory board composed of academic computer scientists and forensics experts was created within the task force to look at technologies and ask companies in the industry to submit their child-protection systems.   Among the systems the technology board looked at included age verification technologies that try to authenticate the identities and ages of children and prevent adults from contacting them. But the board concluded that such systems ''do not appear to offer substantial help in protecting minors from sexual solicitation.''   One problem is that it is difficult to verify the ages and identities of children because they do not have driver's licenses or insurance.  "
Music Industry Imitates Digital Pirates to Turn a Profit,"After years of futile efforts to stop digital pirates from copying its music, the music business has started to copy the pirates.   Online and mobile services offering listeners unlimited ''free'' access to millions of songs are set to proliferate in the coming months, according to music industry executives.   Unlike illegal file-sharing services, which the music industry says are responsible for billions of dollars in lost sales, these new offerings are perfectly legal. The services are not really free, but payment is included in the cost of, say, a new cellphone or a broadband Internet access contract, so the cost to the consumer is disguised. And, unlike pirate sites, these services provide revenue to the music companies.    ''Two thousand nine should be the year when the music industry stopped worrying and learned to love the bomb,'' said Feargal Sharkey, a former punk rocker who now heads UK Music, a trade group for the British music industry.   Previously, the industry largely insisted that legal digital sites sell songs by the track, like Apple's iTunes, or through subscriptions to services that do no let listeners truly own the music.   But over the last year, many people in the industry have become convinced that such offerings will never replace the revenue from plunging sales of CDs. Worldwide music sales fell about 7 percent last year, said John Kennedy, chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Meanwhile, growth in downloads from iTunes, the biggest legitimate digital service, came to a halt.   Perhaps the most prominent service offering unlimited downloads has been Comes With Music, which was introduced in Britain last fall by Nokia, the world's largest maker of cellphones. It lets users download as many songs as they want, from a catalog of more than five million tracks, when they buy certain Nokia phones.   Tero Ojanpera, who is in charge of developing entertainment services at Nokia, said at an industry conference here that Comes With Music would be expanded to Australia and Singapore during the first quarter of this year, and to other European countries later in 2009.    Other services offering unlimited downloads are being introduced by Internet service providers, which many people in the music industry say hold the key to curbing piracy because of their direct relationship with Web users. TDC, an Internet provider in Denmark, offers unrestricted downloads as part of its broadband subscriptions, and broadband providers elsewhere in Europe are rolling out similar services.   The government of the Isle of Man  announced plans for a system under which consumers with broadband subscriptions would be required to pay a nominal monthly license fee. They could then legally download music from any source, even peer-to-peer services that are outlawed currently.   ''At the end of the day, we are not going to stop piracy, so let's embrace it,'' said Ron Berry, the inward investment manager for the Isle of Man government.   Music companies have balked at such arrangements in the past. But they are showing a newfound flexibility in licensing their material as their existence becomes increasingly threatened.   Internet service providers, which previously resisted calls for them to take an active role in stamping out piracy are looking to offer music in their broadband packages.   Governments are also moving in to require more policing by Internet providers.    France is poised to enact a law requiring providers to shut down the Internet connections of persistent copyright offenders.    Britain, meanwhile, has threatened to introduce further legislation if voluntary measures to try to curb piracy are unsuccessful.   Music industry executives and Nicholas Lansman, secretary general of the Internet Service Providers Association of Britain, said they were confident that they could soon reach a licensing agreement to make unlimited music services available via Internet providers.   Cellphone manufacturers, meanwhile, are eager to add music services as the battle of the smartphones heats up among companies like Nokia, Apple and BlackBerry.   Mr. Ojanpera, of Nokia,  declined to say how many of the Comes With Music phones had been sold in Britain.  "
A Fix for Music Piracy: Tack a Fee on Broadband,"Two generations ago, the Isle of Man gave the world the Bee Gees. Now it says it wants to help the wounded music industry stay alive.    The island, a rainy outpost in the Irish Sea, is promoting an offbeat remedy for digital piracy, which the music labels blame for billions of dollars in lost sales. Instead of fighting file-sharing, the local government wants to embrace it -- and it is trying to enlist a skeptical music industry's help.   Under a proposal announced this month, the 80,000 people who live on the Isle of Man would be able to download unlimited amounts of music -- perhaps even from notorious peer-to-peer pirate sites. To make this possible, broadband subscribers would pay a nominal fee of as little as $:1, or $1.38, a month to their Internet service providers.    Ron Berry, director of inward investment for the Isle of Man, said the music industry needed radical approaches because of the ''utter failure'' of its current strategies. Global music sales have fallen nearly 25 percent since 2000.    Despite nearly a decade of campaigning against piracy, the industry's international trade group estimates, 95 percent of tracks distributed online are pirated, generating no revenue for the recording companies.   ''A lot of people in the business are concerned with how much money they are losing, but not with how much money they could make,'' Mr. Berry said.   Under his proposal, the money collected by the Internet providers would be sent to a special agency that would distribute the proceeds to the copyright owners, including the record labels and music publishers. They would receive payments based on how often their music was downloaded or streamed over the Internet, as they now do in many countries when it is performed live or on the radio.   The Isle of Man did not invent this idea. The concept of a so-called blanket license to distribute music digitally has been discussed since the days when Napster, before its rebirth as a legal service, thumbed its nose at the music industry.   There are precedents for such systems in Europe, where many countries have mandatory license fees for television owners to finance public broadcasting. Several European countries also impose taxes on blank CDs as well as audiovisual and computer equipment; the money typically goes to support cultural industries.    In 2006, a French proposal similar to the one being discussed on the Isle of Man made it to Parliament, but it was rejected after fierce lobbying from copyright owners. The government later threw its weight behind a new approach: requiring Internet service providers to disconnect persistent pirates.    That plan is still wending its way through the legislature, but it has drawn interest elsewhere, including in Britain. (While the Isle of Man shares a head of state with the United Kingdom -- the queen -- it has its own parliament and makes its own laws.) There, policy makers are dangling the threat of a system like France's plan to disconnect pirates, to try to get Internet providers and the music companies to agree on ways to stimulate the development of legitimate digital music sales and to curb piracy.   While the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the major labels in the United States, has backed away from a nearly six-year campaign of litigation against individual file-sharers, the music companies' continuing effort to battle piracy in other ways dismays some analysts.    ''They spend 90 percent of their time trying to keep me from doing what I want to do and 10 percent of their time trying to make it possible,'' said Gerd Leonhard, author of ''The Future of Music.''    Actually, the major music companies -- Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and EMI -- have grown considerably more flexible in recent months, making their music available in ways they might once have considered unthinkable.   New services offering ''free'' music, bundled into the cost of a broadband subscription or financed by advertising, are proliferating. ''On the drawing board, these are very virtuous models, but it's all about getting the right implementation,'' said Michael Nash, executive vice president for digital strategy and business development at Warner Music. ''You don't want to completely displace all your existing consumers and end up with a lower-value model.''   Representatives for Sony and Universal declined to comment on the Isle of Man proposal. A spokesman for EMI could not be reached.   Rather than adopting one-size-fits-all licensing terms, the recording companies say their preferred approach is to work with individual partners to increase digital revenue, which accounted for about 20 percent of the industry's sales last year, according to the industry's global trade group, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.   John Kennedy, chief executive of the federation, called plans like that of the Isle of Man effectively a ''state-imposed tax that would be unworkable in practice and discriminate against consumers who want Internet access without music services.''   The island, perhaps best known as a tax haven -- the government prefers ''tax-efficient jurisdiction'' -- has taken an interest in digital music and other high-technology businesses as it seeks to diversify its economy beyond financial services.   In 2001, it was the first place in the world to start third-generation cellphone services, known as 3G. Broadband is available in every home, and more than 70 percent of households are connected.   Mr. Berry, the director of inward investment, said he had begun talks with music companies to try to gain support for his plan.    ''Our size, demographics and history of innovation means that the island could be an ideal test bed,'' he said. "
"Most Pirated Movie? In 2009, It's 'Star Trek'","Though ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' may have represented the year's most notorious case of film piracy, hitting the Internet a month before it was released in theaters, it was not the year's most widely pirated movie, The Hollywood Reporter said. That dubious distinction belonged to the J. J. Abrams-directed reboot of ''Star Trek,'' featuring Zachary Quinto as a young Spock, which topped a list of disparate films compiled by the Web site TorrentFreak.com, which tracks the file-sharing program BitTorrent.   According to that list, ''Star Trek'' was downloaded close to 11 million times, and other guy-oriented blockbusters dominated the chart: ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'' was No. 2, with 10.6 million downloads; ''The Hangover'' was No. 4, with 9.2 million downloads; ''Wolverine'' was No. 9, with 7.2 million downloads. But there was no accounting for pirates' tastes, and no clear correlation between piracy and the overall box office revenues of these movies. The year's No. 3 was the Guy Ritchie misfire ''RocknRolla,'' which earned less than $26 million worldwide since its 2008 release but was downloaded more than 9.4 million times; the No. 5 slot went to the first installment of ''Twilight,'' which took in nearly $385 million globally and was downloaded more than 8.7 million times.

Additional Guilty Plea By Hacker In Thefts,"A 28-year-old college dropout pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges that he stole tens of millions of payment card numbers by breaking into corporate computer systems.    The hacker, Albert Gonzalez, told a federal judge in Boston that he had engineered electronic thefts at companies including the card processor Heartland Payment Systems, the convenience store 7-Eleven and the Hannaford chain of New England grocery stores.   Mr. Gonzalez has previously pleaded guilty to computer break-ins at the retailers TJX Companies,  BJ's Wholesale Club  and Barnes & Noble.   ''You face a considerable amount of time in jail as a result of your plea,'' Federal District Judge P. Douglas Woodlock told Mr. Gonzalez.  ''All aspects of your life are to be affected.''   A federal court in Boston last week sentenced one of Mr. Gonzalez's conspirators, Stephen Watt of New York, to two years in prison for developing the software used to capture payment card data. It also ordered Mr. Watt to pay $171.5 million in restitution.   Mr. Gonzalez's lawyer, Martin Weinberg, has asked for  leniency, saying his client suffers from Internet addiction, drug abuse and symptoms of a mild form of autism known as Asperger syndrome.   Mr. Gonzalez, who appeared in court wearing a beige prison uniform, told the judge that he had abused alcohol and illegal drugs for years. He mentioned marijuana, cocaine, LSD, ketamine and hallucinogenic mushrooms.   ''It's one of the reasons to explain why a young man in his 20s did these things,'' Mr. Weinberg said.   A psychiatrist hired by Mr. Gonzalez has told the court that the hacker's criminal behavior  ''was consistent with the description of the Asperger's disorder.'' Prosecutors have petitioned the court to perform their own psychiatric evaluation.   Mr. Weinberg has sought to block that request, saying it was  unprecedented to conduct a psychiatric evaluation before  sentencing.   ''He's admitted responsibility,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''He is remorseful.'' Putting Photos    On the Map   Q.Is there a way to add map coordinates to my photos before I upload them to Flickr?   A. Geotagging typically refers to the act of embedding location data like GPS coordinates into photo files so they can be pinpointed on an electronic map and viewers can see where they were taken. Pictures can be linked to a spot on a map on a site like Flickr, or with software like Picasa and Google Earth. But you don't have to manually map the photos.   Although it can be an expensive option, getting a camera with a GPS chip inside, like the Nikon Coolpix P6000, is one way to automatically geotag photos.     Add-on gadgets are another option, and most cost less than $150. Sony's GPS-CS1KASP GPS unit (snipurl.com/cosyp) records coordinates and then matches them to the timestamps on your pictures when you upload everything to the computer. It does require a compatible camera and a Windows-based PC, however. For Windows users, a combination of a TrackStick personal GPS unit (trackstick.com) and free software like PictoMio (pictomio.com) can also work.   Products like the ATP PhotoFinder (photofinder.atpinc.com) work in a similar fashion, but here, you can skip the computer entirely. You match up the GPS data to photos by inserting the camera's memory card into the device. Once photo and location have been synchronized, you can import the photos from the card to the computer.   If you have an Eye-Fi memory card with built-in wireless networking for the camera, a subscription to the company's $15-a-year geotagging service (www.eye.fi/services/geotagging) can map your photos. For those wanting to try out basic geotagging on popular Web sites, Flickr has a video that explains the process (www.flickr.com/help/screencasts/vol1/). There are also instructions for using Picasa to geotag photos in Google Earth at snipurl.com/coset.    Test Drive   For Security   Q.I'm worried that if I get a new antivirus program to replace my outdated one, it will make my PC crash all the time or get in my way. How can I make sure I get a decent program?   A. Because they reach deep into the Windows system to protect it, antivirus programs have been known to conflict with the operating system or other security software installed on the computer. This can lead to a festival of blue screens and even more colorful words from frustrated users.

You may have to install or uninstall software in the quest to find a security program that makes both you and the PC  happy, but being able to try before you buy can be worth the effort.

Building a Better Black Box,"Modern communication technology allows even those with little important to say to transmit real-time information about where they are and what they are doing. But last month, when Airbus jets from Air France and Yemenia Airways crashed into the ocean, taking their black boxes into the deep with them, neither aircraft could send its data and cockpit voice recordings  to a secure place on the ground.    On July 2, the day that the missing recorders from Air France Flight 447 were presumed to have exhausted their 30-day battery and stopped emitting the pinging noise of the locator beacon, Airbus announced that it would look for new ways to reduce the chance of losing critical data.     ''This is a worldwide industry issue, albeit a rare one,'' said Mary Anne Greczyn, manager of communications for Airbus Americas. In an e-mail message, Ms. Greczyn said, ''Recent accidents certainly made this a front-burner topic of discussion.''    What is known so far about the crash of Flight 447, in which 228 people died, comes from automatic messages sent from the airplane to Air France. Those messages are not intended to provide information for accident investigators but are routinely used by airlines for maintenance. When an airplane is crossing an ocean and out of radio range, only the most important information is sent, since communication must be by satellite and transmission is expensive. Airlines can select what kind of flight data is worth the price of satellite time.    According to a statement from Airbus, even using the normal radio signal to send all the information about a flight would require enormous bandwidth.    But Krishna Kavi,  a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of North Texas, said  that might not be the case. In 2001, Mr. Kavi proposed transmitting in real time just the information from the flight data recorder. ''The amount of data is very small compared to video photos that you receive on smartphones,'' he said. Mr. Kavi said his plan was even more achievable today.   Mike  Poole, an air crash investigator with CAE Flightscape, an aviation safety company in Canada, said that transmitting all that data in real time ''sounds really attractive''  but was not that easy.     Mr. Poole, who is also the chairman of the flight recorder working group of the International Society of Air Safety Investigators, said complicating factors include the number of planes in flight at any one time, the need for planes to have a clear line of sight to connect with the satellite, and the integrity and confidentiality of the data being sent. The last point is of particular concern to pilots who have long opposed video cameras in the cockpit, citing the potential for public release of the recordings.   ''What do we do about data protection? That's one that very much concerns the operating crews,'' said Paul McCarthy, who represents the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations at the International Civil Aviation Organization. ''If the data is not adequately protected, transmission could be an invasion of privacy.''   These problems have been discussed for years in the industry. What is different now is the attention being paid to the still-inexplicable loss of Flight 447, the apparent inability to retrieve the boxes from the Yemenia Airways Airbus that crashed into the deep waters of the Indian Ocean off the Comoros Islands and the expectation of air travelers that multimillion-dollar airplanes should have more, not less, technological capability than the average Twitter user.    ''We can't afford to lose an aircraft without drawing a proper conclusion,'' said Dieter Reisinger,  a long-haul commercial airline pilot and director of the Institute for Flight Safety in Austria. ''We might be at a crossroads. Streaming is the next logical step.''    It is not necessarily the only step.   ''It's accidents like this that get people to think out of the box,'' said Brian T. Gallagher, the director of public affairs for DRS Technologies of Parsippany, N.J. For the past 25  years, his company has been installing data recorders on the outside of military airplanes like the F-18 and on helicopters carrying oil field workers in the North Sea. On impact in  a crash, the recorder, which is encased in an airfoil, flies away from the aircraft. If the plane sinks in the water, the recorder will float. A transmitter signals its location using GPS.   ''Instead of it going down and pinging, it deploys the moment of the crash and hooks up with the satellites,'' said the company's vice president and general manager, Peter Connolly. ''It will move it away from the crash scene.''   The deployable data recorder has been recovered in all of the approximately 110 accidents involving military airplanes, Mr. Connolly said. DRS is working with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Homeland Security Department to certify the device for use on commercial airliners, but the process has been lengthy.    Ten years ago, a DRS engineer, Rob Austin, wrote a report citing  six large aviation disasters in which the recovery of the black boxes was difficult because the flights went down in the ocean. In some cases, military ships were called in for the recovery, at great expense.  Mr. Austin was prophetic as he described a situation in which the deployable data recorder would be effective.    ''One can imagine cases such as a midair breakup over deep ocean where the exact location of the aircraft is difficult to track,'' he wrote. ''If the search extended beyond the 30-day lifetime of the ultrasonic locator beacon, the recorders might never be found.''   With two ocean crashes in one month and no recorders found, Airbus is under considerable pressure. Thomas O. Enders, the company's chief executive, said two department heads would be assigned to investigate live data transmission, external black boxes and one low-tech but highly relevant response to the loss of Flight 447 -- extending the life of the black box pinger.  "
A Small-Business Guide to Disaster Recovery,"Every business should have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan. Unfortunately, because the idea of developing one can seem time-consuming and tedious, many entrepreneurs choose to go without one. Although it's always best to have a complete plan, it's better to have a few crucial pieces than nothing at all. So even if you can't do everything, do something.    That's what Len Oppenheimer, chief executive of the Golden Box, a provider of custom packaging to companies in the tristate area around New York City, did -- just before a power surge in his office blew out a primary server. ''We had started doing online backups literally three days before the server went down,'' Mr. Oppenheimer said. ''If we hadn't had that safety net in place, I hate to even think about where we'd be right now.''    This guide is intended to simplify the disaster-recovery planning process by breaking the overall task into building blocks, covering major areas like data, communication and people. Use it as a starting point and adjust it to fit your own needs.   If you're feeling overwhelmed by the idea of developing a disaster-recovery  plan on your own, hire an expert. Investing a few dollars now can save money -- or even your entire business -- down the road. ''After 9/11 we knew we needed a D.R. plan for the business,'' said Karin Ajmani, chief executive of U.S. Imaging Network. ''We didn't know where to begin, so I outsourced. We ended up with a really solid plan that everyone in the company is comfortable with. Fortunately, we haven't needed it yet, but I definitely sleep better now.''    Whatever you do, don't wait.   Data   The most common business disaster is data loss, which can result from a number of causes including human error, hardware failure, natural disaster and theft. Fortunately, data loss is easy to recover from if you have a backup solution in place. To make sure you get the right solution for your business's needs, follow these steps:   1. Familiarize yourself with your data. Know what you have, where it is and what is most important. If you walked into your office tomorrow and your data were gone, what would you miss the most?   2. Consider backup options. Your backup must be offsite, secure and available for recovery 24/7. One popular option that meets the above criteria, with the added benefit of ease of use and automation, is online backup. Other options include tape or backup to external media.    3. If you have chosen to outsource your backup needs, make sure that you choose a provider that offers security, monitoring and support.    4. Decide who will be responsible for either managing backups internally or working with your selected provider to get your backup solution carried out.    5. Do a run-through of the recovery process. Backup is nothing without recovery, so be sure that you are familiar with the recovery process and confident that it works smoothly. Your provider should be happy to walk you through a test-recovery procedure.    6. Review your data regularly to be sure you're backing up everything you need. For example, if you add a new server in your office, your backups should reflect this addition. This should be done every other quarter if not once a quarter.    Contact and Communication   All the contact information and communication methods that you take for granted could be inaccessible in an emergency. Just ask Peter Laughter, chief executive of Wall Street Services, a temporary staffing and consulting firm servicing financial clients. He had to evacuate his downtown office on 9/11. ''We had the foresight to have printouts of customer and employee contact information,'' he said  -- but there was no way for his clients to reach his employees.   Michael Adams, the director of information technology at Bush Ross, a law firm in Tampa, Fla., had a similar problem. During Hurricane Charlie, the firm's T1 phone lines were down for 24 hours. ''Our lawyers' clients and the courts had no way of reaching them by phone, since they never gave out their cellphone numbers,'' Mr. Adams said. ''It was extremely stressful.''   The firm has since put a disaster-recovery plan in place for phone and fax lines. As part of your own planning, you should create backup contact lists and set up alternative methods of communication:   1. Decide on intercompany communication methods to be used if you cannot enter your office. Options include cellphones, instant messaging, Skype and a Web-based e-mail service like Gmail or Yahoo.    2. Make arrangements for incoming communications (how clients and others will reach you). Consider using a VoIP system like Grasshopper or Vonage, which let you forward your office lines to other numbers. Companies with 10 or more users might want to look into a more sophisticated hosted VoIP system like  M5 .    3. Create contact lists so that you aren't stuck without critical information when you lack access to your servers. Upload documents to an online location so that they are accessible from anywhere. There are secure online document storage sites for documents, like vSafe from Wells Fargo Bank or lockyourdocs.com, which is  --  full disclosure  --  part of my company.    People   For your plan to work, you need to prepare your employees so that they understand where to go and what to do if something happens:   1. Identify critical functions like setting up communication methods, drafting e-mail messages, contacting clients and vendors and handling insurance.   2. Decide who will be responsible for your critical functions.   3. Designate a location where everyone in your office will meet if you need to evacuate.   4. Designate an alternative working location (or locations), whether it be another office space you can use, or everyone working from home.   5. When your plan is complete, distribute it to every employee. Consider uploading a copy to an online location accessible to all employees at all times.   6. Review your plan with your employees regularly.   At some point your business is going to face an emergency situation, it's just a matter of what type, what magnitude and when. The best preparation for any situation you may face is to have a well-thought-out plan in place and to educate your team on its elements. "
"In New World Of Military Spending, Small Is Beautiful","AT one time, it may have been true that  ''an army marches on its stomach.'' But with food supplies generally not a problem for modern armies, the proverb should probably be updated to something like this:  an army marches on its laptops and the information flowing through them.    And that means  opportunity for small military contractors, even in a time of constrained budgets.     Jon B. Kutler, founder and chairman of Admiralty Partners in Los Angeles, who has invested about $70 million in several small military contractors in  the last seven years, said he thought financing for crucial technologies like  communications would ''fare very well in the next three to five years.'' He said military spending was at a turning point ''in that it is not in vast programs for aircraft or mammoth undertakings that take 10  years to complete, but smaller companies in fields like cybersecurity.''    Mr. Kutler, a onetime naval officer, said that American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan  were fighting dispersed  smaller groups. ''That demands communications and sensors and all manner of technology,'' he said. ''Communications needs to be at the level of individual soldiers. And it must be secure from the enemy, too. So we need surveillance and security of information and reconnaissance to see the enemy.   ''All of this will see increased spending,'' he said, ''but that can come in small companies and programs.''     Loren B. Thompson, a longtime defense analyst and chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Va., predicted that ''the Pentagon will be the biggest consumer of information systems and software in the world for the foreseeable future.''   That trend is likely to favor companies like  Trident Space and Defense  of Torrance, Calif., which is owned by Admiralty Partners. Trident  ''had its best year ever in 2008, is doing well this year and we look for growth next year,'' said Gerald Smith, vice president and general manager.    Trident makes components for satellites that  are in demand as surveillance increases. It also provides ground systems and tracking services for satellite programs of countries around the world. The company, which has 70 employees and about $45 million in annual revenue, also makes solid-state drives for laptop computers that are intended to  withstand battlefield conditions.   Trident, a 33-year old company,  started out selling components internationally as a division of TRW, an early defense firm  acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2002. In 2007, Admiralty Partners bought the operation that is now Trident and expanded its operations, in domestic markets and internationally.    Other investments by Mr. Kutler's firm include AmSafe Aviation  in Phoenix, which makes seat belts and harnesses for the airline industry, and Pankl Aerospace Systems, of Cerritos, Calif., which supplies helicopter drive shafts and other equipment.    For Trident, Mr. Smith said, the solid-state drives and other  systems might become the largest part of the business in the next few years. The attraction, said Roydn  Jones, the company's chief technology officer, was that computers with solid-state drives, as opposed to more common rotating drives, could operate in desert heat or other adverse conditions ''and they can be dropped from the back of a Humvee and continue to work.''    Until recently, solid-state drives were less  common because they were more expensive. But prices have come down, Mr. Jones said, because solid-state electronics in MP3 music players and similar devices turned them from a niche to a mass-market product.    The  mingling of commercial and military technology is characteristic of military  programs these days, said Eric M. DeMarco, chief executive of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. He cited a product made by his company,  NeuralStar, which  helps make  computer systems more secure from tampering by hackers, spies and other attackers. The NeuralStar system ''has a contract to manage the whole flow of information across many levels of a government department,'' he said. ''That product originated in commercial telecommunications.''   In the future, Mr. DeMarco said, he expected to  see more use of unmanned systems. ''Not only aircraft but robots and 'Terminator' type warfare.''    At the same time, he predicted, those  products would also be used in civilian and commercial programs. ''I would see unmanned systems used in crop dusting and surveillance and fighting of forest fires,'' he said. And communications will be critical, he said. ''With all unmanned systems, command and control must be maintained and protected, down to the individual war fighter. It's not top-down information but distributed throughout the command.''    Kratos, based in San Diego, grew in recent years by acquiring  small defense and technology companies. It has just refinanced  with a $19 million sale of stock through B. Riley & Company, a Los Angeles investment bank. Mr. DeMarco said  the money would  be used to pay down debt and perhaps to make an acquisition of a small company in electronics and optical technology. ''The recession opens opportunities,'' Mr. DeMarco said.    John Keating, chief executive of Com Dev International, a Canadian company that recently invested in the United States, said he also expected a sharing of technology for commercial and military uses.  ''Rather than building a separate satellite program, military payloads will share space on commercial communications satellites,'' said Mr. Keating, whose company has been  a supplier for the last 40 years of electronics and optical subsystems to the former Hughes Aircraft and Boeing Company and other makers of communications satellites.   In 2006, the company, based in Cambridge, Ontario,  invested $25 million to create Com Dev USA in El Segundo, Calif.,  to bid for military and civil government satellite business in the United States. Mr. Keating said he saw a special area of business growth. ''The world satellite business will grow only moderately in the coming years,'' he suggested, ''but we have technology and many other products and services we can bring into U.S. markets.''   What those investment patterns suggest, said Mr. Thompson of the Lexington Institute, is that overall military spending -- currently at $680  billion in the fiscal 2010 budget -- ''will probably decline in years ahead.'' But, he added, ''second-tier defense contractors focused in information technology and intelligence applications will probably do well in the emerging military market.''   "
"Defying Experts, Rogue Code Lurks in World's Computers","It is still out there.    Like a ghost ship, a rogue software program that glided onto the Internet last November has confounded the efforts of top security experts to eradicate the program and trace its origins and purpose, exposing serious weaknesses in the world's digital infrastructure.    The program, known as Conficker, uses flaws in Windows software to co-opt machines and link them into a virtual computer that can be commanded remotely by its authors. With more than five million of these zombies now under its control -- government, business and home computers in more than 200 countries -- this shadowy computer has power that dwarfs that of the world's largest data centers.     Alarmed by the program's quick spread after its debut in November, computer security experts from industry, academia and government joined forces in a highly unusual collaboration. They decoded the program and developed antivirus software that erased it from millions of the computers. But Conficker's persistence and sophistication has squelched the belief of many experts that such global computer infections are a thing of the past.    ''It's using the best current practices and state of the art to communicate and to protect itself,'' Rodney Joffe, director of the Conficker Working Group, said of the malicious program. ''We have not found the trick to take control back from the malware in any way.''   Researchers speculate that the computer could be employed to generate vast amounts of spam; it could steal information like passwords and logins by capturing keystrokes on infected computers; it could deliver fake antivirus warnings to trick naive users into believing their computers are infected and persuading them to pay by credit card to have the infection removed.   There is also a different possibility that concerns the researchers: That the program was not designed by a criminal gang, but instead by an intelligence agency or the military of some country to monitor or disable an enemy's computers. Networks of infected computers, or botnets, were used widely as weapons in conflicts in Estonia in 2007 and in Georgia last year, and in more recent attacks against South Korean and United States government agencies. Recent attacks that temporarily crippled Twitter and Facebook were believed to have had political overtones.    Yet for the most part Conficker  has done little more than to extend its reach to more and more computers. Though there had been speculation that the computer might be activated to do something malicious on April 1, the date passed without incident, and some security experts wonder if the program has been abandoned.    The  experts have only tiny clues about the location of the program's authors. The first version included software that stopped the program if it infected a machine with a Ukrainian language keyboard. There may have been two initial infections -- in Buenos Aires and in Kiev.   Wherever the authors are, the experts say, they are clearly professionals using the most advanced technology available. The program is protected by internal defense mechanisms that make it hard to erase, and even kills or hides from programs designed to look for botnets.   A member of the security team said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had suspects, but was moving slowly because it needed to build a relationship with ''noncorrupt'' law enforcement agencies in the countries where the suspects are located.   An F.B.I. spokesman in Washington declined to comment, saying that the Conficker investigation was an open case.   The first infections, last Nov. 20, set off an intense battle between the hidden authors and the volunteer group that formed to counter them. The group, which first called itself the ''Conficker Cabal,'' changed its name when Microsoft, Symantec and several other companies objected to the unprofessional connotation.    Eventually, university researchers and law enforcement officials joined forces with computer experts at more than two dozen Internet, software and computer security firms.    The group won some battles, but lost others. The Conficker authors kept distributing new, more intricate versions of the program, at one point using code that had been devised in academia only months before. At another point, a single technical slip by the working group allowed the program's authors to convert a huge number of the infected machines to an advanced peer-to-peer communications scheme that the industry group has not been able to defeat. Where before all the infected computers would have to phone home to a single source for instructions, the authors could now use any infected computer to instruct all the others.    In early April, Patrick Peterson, a research fellow at Cisco Systems in San Jose, Calif., gained  some intelligence about the authors' interests. He studies nasty computer programs by keeping a set of quarantined computers that capture and observe them -- his ''digital zoo.''    He discovered that the Conficker authors had begun distributing software that tricks Internet users into buying fake antivirus software with their credit cards. ''We turned off the lights in the zoo one day and came back the next day,'' Mr. Peterson said, noting that in the ''cage'' reserved for Conficker, the infection had been joined by a program distributing an antivirus software scam.    It was the most recent sign of life from the program, and its silence has set off a debate among computer security experts. Some researchers think Conficker is an empty shell, or that the authors of the program were scared away in the spring. Others argue that they are simply biding their time.   If the misbegotten computer were reactivated, it would not have the problem-solving ability of supercomputers used to design nuclear weapons or simulate climate change. But because it has commandeered so many machines, it could draw on an amount of computing power greater than that from any single computing facility run by governments or Google. It is a dark reflection of the  ''cloud computing'' sweeping the commercial Internet, in which data is stored on the Internet rather than on a personal computer.    The industry group continues to try to find ways to kill Conficker,  meeting as recently as Tuesday. Mr. Joffe said he, for one, was not prepared to declare victory. But he said that the group's work proved that government and private industry could cooperate to counter cyberthreats.    ''Even if we lose against Conficker,'' he said, ''there are things we've learned that will benefit us in the future.''

Worm Infects Millions Of Computers Worldwide,"A new digital plague has hit the Internet, infecting millions of personal and business computers in what seems to be the first step of a multistage attack. The world's leading computer security experts do not yet know who programmed the infection, or what the next stage will be.    In recent weeks a worm, a malicious software program, has swept through corporate, educational and public computer networks around the world. Known as Conficker or Downadup, it is spread by a recently discovered Microsoft Windows vulnerability, by guessing network passwords and by hand-carried consumer gadgets like USB keys.     Experts say it is the worst infection since the Slammer worm exploded through the Internet in January  2003, and it may have infected as many as nine million personal computers around the world.   Worms like Conficker not only ricochet around the Internet at lightning speed, they harness infected computers into unified systems called botnets, which can then accept programming instructions from their clandestine masters. ''If you're looking for a digital Pearl Harbor, we now have the Japanese ships steaming toward us on the horizon,'' said Rick Wesson, chief executive of Support Intelligence, a computer security consulting firm based in San Francisco.    Many computer users may not notice that their machines have been infected, and computer security researchers said  they were waiting for the instructions to materialize, to determine what impact the botnet will have on PC users. It might operate in the background, using the infected computer to send spam or infect other computers, or it might steal the PC user's personal information.    ''I don't know why people aren't more afraid of these programs,'' said Merrick L. Furst, a computer scientist at Georgia Tech. ''This is like having a mole in your organization that can do things like send out any information it finds on machines it infects.''   Microsoft rushed an emergency patch to defend the Windows operating systems against this vulnerability in October, yet the worm has continued to spread even as the level of warnings has grown in recent weeks.   Earlier this week, security researchers at Qualys, a Silicon Valley security firm, estimated that about 30 percent of Windows-based computers attached to the Internet remain vulnerable to infection because they have not been updated with the patch, despite the fact that it was made available in October. The firm's estimate is based on a survey of nine million Internet addresses.    Security researchers said  the success of Conficker was due in part to lax security practices by both companies and individuals, who frequently do not immediately install updates.    A Microsoft executive defended the company's security update service, saying there is no single solution to the malware problem.   ''I do believe the updating strategy is working,'' said George Stathakopoulos, general manager for Microsoft's Security Engineering and Communications group. But he added that organizations must focus on everything from timely updates to password security.    ''It's all about defense in depth,'' Mr. Stathakopoulos  said.   Alfred Huger, vice president of development at Symantec's security response division, said, ''This is a really well-written worm.'' He said  security companies were still racing to try to unlock all of its  secrets.   Unraveling the program has been particularly challenging because it comes with  encryption mechanisms that hide its internal workings from those seeking to disable it.   Most security firms have updated their programs to detect and eradicate the software, and a variety of companies offer specialized software programs for detecting and removing it.   The program uses an elaborate shell-game-style technique to permit someone to  command it remotely. Each day it generates a new list of 250 domain names. Instructions from any one of these domain names would be obeyed. To control the botnet, an attacker would need only to register a single domain to send instructions to the botnet globally, greatly complicating the task of law enforcement and security companies  trying to intervene and block the activation of the botnet.   Computer security researchers expect that within days or weeks the bot-herder who controls the programs will send out commands to force the botnet to perform some as yet unknown illegal activity.    Several computer security firms said that although Conficker appeared to have been written from scratch, it had  parallels to the  work of a suspected Eastern European criminal gang that has profited by sending programs known as ''scareware'' to personal computers that seem to warn users of an infection and ask for credit card numbers to pay for bogus antivirus software that actually further infects their computer.    One intriguing clue left by the malware authors is that the first version of the program checked to see if the computer had a Ukrainian keyboard layout. If it found it had such a keyboard, it would not infect the machine, according to Phillip Porras, a security investigator at SRI International who has disassembled  the program to determine how it functioned.    The worm has reignited a debate inside the computer security community over the possibility of eradicating the program before it is used by sending out instructions to the botnet that provide users with an alert that their machines have been infected.    ''Yes, we are working on it, as are many others,'' said one botnet researcher  who spoke on the grounds that he not be identified because of his plan. ''Yes, it's illegal, but so was Rosa Parks sitting in the front of the bus.''    This idea of stopping the program in its tracks before it has the ability to do damage was challenged by many in the computer security community.   ''It's a really bad idea,'' said Michael Argast, a security analyst at Sophos, a British computer security firm. ''The ethics of this haven't changed in 20 years, because the reality is that you can cause just as many problems as you solve.'' "
"Typing In an E-Mail Address, and Giving Up Your Friends' as Well","E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com I THOUGHT  it was a little strange when I received separate e-mail messages from two people I knew only slightly asking me to click and see their photos on a social networking site called Tagged.   I ignored them at first, but then thought maybe I should check it out. After all, I should keep up on what's hot in the social networking world, right? This could be the new Twitter.   That's when I started doing everything wrong. I obligingly typed in my e-mail address and a password to see those photos. Well, the photos didn't exist, but I had unwittingly given the site ''permission'' to go through my entire e-mail contact list and send a message to everyone, inviting them to see my ''photos.''   I found this out only when I started receiving e-mail back from people agreeing to be my friend. I quickly realized what had happened and shot off an apologetic message explaining why I inadvertently spammed them.    As friends' responses started rolling in, I heard from some who had received similar e-mail. Others told me about the same problems with  Web sites like MyLife.com and desktopdating.net.   This wasn't along the lines of someone stealing my bank account information or Social Security number, but I was  annoyed and embarrassed.   ''They're using your good name to establish a connection,'' said Peter Cassidy, secretary general of the Anti-Phishing Working Group, a nonprofit organization with representatives from  law enforcement, industry and government.    So what's going on  here? I turned to Michael Argast, a security analyst with Sophos, an Internet security company based in Boston, to find out.   He told me that this kind of thing has been happening  for quite a long time in various forms, but has really caught on in the last three to six months. It's not the same as what's known as phishing -- fake Web sites masquerading as real ones to get personal  information. These Web sites really exist.    Instead, this is generally called contact scraping. Once you enter your credentials, like your user name or password, the company sweeps through your contact list and sends everyone an invitation to join the site.    How do the companies benefit? They are expanding their user population, Mr. Argast said, which they can use to attract potential investors or advertisers. Whether those users are willing participants, or people like me, is another question.   ''There are multiple shades of gray,'' Mr. Argast said. ''Some social networking sites, like Facebook, are pretty straightforward in asking if you want to share information about your friends. Others are far less scrupulous.''   In the case of Tagged,  my friends received a perky e-mail saying: ''Alina has added you as a friend on Tagged. Is Alina your friend?'' Then you click on yes or no. Even more insidiously, it adds, ''Please respond or Alina may think you said no,'' with a sad-face icon next to it.   I apparently also offered to share some photos; some annoyed friends even told me to resend the pictures because they couldn't find them.   ''It's using the chain mail psychology,'' Mr. Argast said. And he's right. My friends got guilt-tripped into signing on.    It's easier for these sites to get information from Web-based e-mail accounts, like Hotmail and Gmail,  than from local Internet provider services, like Verizon or Comcast, but nothing is absolutely secure, Mr. Argast said.   I spoke to Greg Tseng, founder and chief executive of Tagged, to ask him what happened. He said all social networking sites invite you to e-mail your contact list to join up or discover which of your friends are already members, but that a software glitch meant an unusually large number of accidental invitations went out recently.   He said the company received almost 2,000 complaints from people who didn't intend to send invitations to all their contacts -- a fraction of the three million people who registered in the month when the problem occurred.   ''We immediately pushed the pause button,'' Mr. Tseng said. ''This business lives and dies by the good will of people.'' He added, ''We took immediate steps to rectify this problem and improve the user experience on Tagged.''   Mr. Tseng said Tagged was the third-largest social networking site after Facebook and MySpace, with 16 million active users and 80 million registered users. And guess what? I'm counted as one of those registered users now.   A colleague, Tom, received a similar ''invitation'' from an acquaintance inviting him to join MyLife.com about a month ago. He clicked on ''yes,'' and started receiving e-mail from people on his contact list thanking him for inviting them.   ''At first it was amusing, but when I realized that  it was mining my address book, it wasn't so funny anymore,'' he said. MyLife.com was formerly Reunion.com, another site that stirred up numerous complaints regarding contact scraping.   Jeff Tinsley, founder and chief executive of MyLife.com, said that his company was constantly improving its registration system.   ''We register more than two million users a month, and the complaint rate is very small,'' Mr. Tinsley said. ''It's very important to make the process very clear, but that said, sometimes people are going with the flow and not paying attention. It's impossible to just take someone's address book. An individual has to give us his credentials.''    Tom, however, said he didn't recall typing in his password, so he was not sure how his address book was accessed.   In some cases, buried deep within a company's terms of service or privacy policy is information about sharing e-mail addresses, but  few people ever get that far.   ''We don't think the consent is meaningful or transparent,'' said Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a public interest research organization. ''People don't know how their information is being used.''   Donna Tapellini, senior editor for Consumer Reports, which reported on this in its June issue, said such practices raised  privacy issues. ''It's your private contact list and you should be able to protect it,'' she said.   Such actions may also violate the federal antispamming law -- officially known as Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act and unofficially as Can-Spam --  which regulates unsolicited commercial e-mail, prohibiting, among other things, false or misleading information in a subject line, said Eileen Harrington, deputy director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection with the Federal Trade Commission. Ms. Harrington emphasized that she was speaking in general terms.    ''We're now fully in the era of Web 2.0 and under many circumstances, consumers may be providing more information than they realize,'' she said.   The problem is, it takes a long time for people to  learn  the tricks. So here are some words of advice from Mr. Argast.   First, don't supply your user name and password from one site -- say Yahoo or Gmail -- to a third-party site. And don't use the same user names and passwords for different sites. That's good advice that most of us -- myself included -- often fail to follow. He told me some 80 percent of users his company surveyed reuse their passwords.   The problem, of course, is remembering different user names and passwords. There are programs or tools that provide an easy way to remember multiple passwords, like 1Password, Sxipper, Keychain or Firefox Password Manager.   You can also set up a separate e-mail account for registrations, which won't have your contact list.    Also, just be alert. Look closely at the invitation. Are there misspellings, for example? Does something just feel not right? If so, e-mail your friend asking if he meant to send you the query.   Finally, I used this opportunity to clean up my contact list. I hope I'm too savvy to have this happen again, but if it does, at least that acquaintance I met in a seminar two summers ago and the British couple I haven't spoken to in five years will be spared.

Experts See Early Activity From the Conficker Worm,"Members of an informal global alliance of computer security specialists who have been trying to eradicate a malicious software program known as Conficker said Tuesday that they were seeing early attempts by the program to communicate with a control server. The researchers said they were uncertain if it had been successful.    The Conficker software, which has spread aggressively around the globe since October and is designed to lash together infected machines into a powerful computer known as a botnet, has touched off widespread concern.    Computer security researchers who have examined a recent version of the program, called Conficker C, have said it was set to try to download commands from a server at an unknown Internet location on Wednesday. There was no certainty about the intent of the program, which could be used to send e-mail spam, distribute malicious software or generate a potentially devastating ''denial of service'' attack on Web sites or networks.   The choice of April Fool's Day by the program's authors, who are unknown, has led to speculation that the program might be a hoax. But a variety of computer security executives and law enforcement officials have pointed out that the program, which has spread to at least 12 million computers, could inflict genuine harm. Consensus among security specialists on Tuesday was that it was likely to take several days before the program's intent could be determined.   A group of computer security specialists has tried to make it impossible for Conficker's authors to download instructions to infected computers. While they were doing so, the authors began distributing the C version of the program. It was intended to begin contacting 50,000 Internet domains on Wednesday.    In response, the researchers have created a system that will allow them to trap all of the attempted botnet communications. That has involved a global effort, including monitoring the domains of 110 countries.   A spokeswoman for the Conficker Cabal, a security working group organized by Microsoft and other computer security companies, said on Tuesday that the group had no new information to report about the activity of the malicious program.   ''All we are saying is 'patch and clean, patch and clean,' '' said Nicole Miller, a Microsoft spokeswoman, referring to the process of disinfecting and protecting machines infected by the software, which targets Windows-based computers.   Separately, I.B.M. said that Mark Yason, a company researcher, had decoded Conficker's internal communication protocol. The company said that will make it easier for security teams to detect and interrupt the program's activities.   Earlier this year Microsoft offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Conficker's author or authors. "
Viruses That Leave Victims Red in the Facebook,"It used to be that computer viruses attacked only your hard drive. Now they attack your dignity.   Malicious programs are rampaging through Web sites like Facebook and Twitter, spreading themselves by taking over people's accounts and sending out messages to all of their friends and followers. The result is that people are inadvertently telling their co-workers and loved ones how to raise their I.Q.'s or make money instantly,  or urging them to watch an awesome new video in which they star.   ''I wonder what people are thinking of me right now?'' said Matt Marquess, an employee at a public relations firm in San Francisco  whose Twitter account was recently hijacked, showering his followers with messages that appeared to offer a $500 gift card to Victoria's Secret.    Mr. Marquess was clueless about the offers until a professional acquaintance asked him about them via e-mail. Confused, he logged in to his account and noticed he had been promoting lingerie for five days.   ''No one had said anything to me,'' he said. ''I thought, how long have I been Twittering about underwear?''    The humiliation sown by these attacks is just collateral damage. In most cases, the perpetrators are hoping to profit from the referral fees they get for directing people to sketchy e-commerce sites.     In other words, even the crooks are on social networks now -- because millions of tightly connected potential victims are just waiting for them there.   Often the victims lose control of their accounts after clicking on a link ''sent'' by a friend. In other cases, the bad guys apparently scan for accounts with easily guessable passwords. (Mr. Marquess gamely concedes that his password at the time was ''abc123.'')   After discovering their accounts have been seized, victims typically renounce the unauthorized messages publicly, apologizing for inadvertently bombarding their friends. These messages -- one might call them Tweets of shame -- convey a distinct mix of guilt, regret and embarrassment.   ''I have been hacked; taking evasive maneuvers. Much apology, my friends,'' wrote Rocky Barbanica, a producer for Rackspace Hosting, an Internet storage firm, in one such note.   Mr. Barbanica sent that out last month after realizing he had sent messages to 250 Twitter followers with a link and the sentence, ''Are you in this picture?'' If they clicked, their Twitter accounts were similarly commandeered.    ''I took it personally, which I shouldn't have, but that's the natural feeling. It's insulting,'' he said.   Earlier malicious programs could also cause a similar measure of embarrassment if they spread themselves through a person's e-mail address book.    But those messages, traveling from computer to computer, were more likely to be stopped by antivirus or firewall software. On the Web, such measures offer little protection. (Although they are popularly referred to as viruses or worms, the new forms of Web-based malicious programs  do not technically fall into those categories, as they are not self-contained programs.)   Getting tangled up in a virus on a social network is also more painfully, and instantaneously, public. ''Once it's delivered to everyone in three seconds, the cat is out of the bag,'' said Chet Wisniewski of Sophos, a Web security firm. ''When people got viruses on their computers, or fell for scams at home, they were generally the only ones that knew about it and they cleaned it up themselves. It wasn't broadcast to the whole world.''   Social networks have become prime targets of such programs' creators for good reason, security experts say. People implicitly trust the messages they receive from friends, and are inclined to overlook the fact that, say, their cousin from Ohio is extremely unlikely to have caught them on a hidden webcam.   Sophos says that 21 percent of Web users report that they have been a target of malicious programs on social networks. Kaspersky Labs, a Russian security firm, says that on some days, one in 500 links on Twitter point to bad sites that can infect an inadequately protected computer with typical viruses that jam hard drives. Kaspersky says many more links are purely spam, frequently leading to dating sites that pay referral fees for traffic.   A worm that spread around Facebook recently featured a photo of a sparsely dressed woman and offered a link to ''see more.'' Adi Av, a computer developer in Ashkelon, Israel, encountered the image on the Facebook page of a friend he considered to be a reliable source of amusing Internet content.    A couple of clicks later,  the image was posted on Mr. Av's Facebook profile and sent to the ''news feed'' of his 350 friends.    ''It's an honest mistake,'' he said. ''The main embarrassment was from the possibility of other people getting into the same trouble from my profile page.''   Others confess to experiencing a more serious discomfiture.   ''You feel like a total idiot,'' said Jodi Chapman, who last month unwisely clicked on a Twitter message from a fellow vegan, suggesting that she take an online intelligence test.    Ms. Chapman, who sells environmentally friendly gifts with her husband, uses her Twitter account to communicate with thousands of her company's customers. The hijacking ''filled me with a sense of panic,'' she said. ''I was so worried that I had somehow tainted our company name by asking people to check their I.Q. scores.''   Social networking attacks do not spare the experts. Two weeks ago, Lee Rainey, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project, a nonprofit research group, accidentally sent messages to dozens of his Twitter followers with a link and the line, ''Hi, is this you? LOL.'' He said a few people actually clicked.   ''I'm worried that people will think I communicate this way,'' Mr. Rainey said. '' 'LOL,' as my children would tell you, is not the style that I want to engage the world with.'' "
Universities Spar Over Disappearing Electronic Messages,"In less than two months after a group of University of Washington computer researchers proposed a novel system for making electronic messages ''disappear'' after a certain period of time, a rival group of researchers based at the University of Texas at Austin, Princeton, and the University of Michigan, has claimed to have undermined the scheme.    In July, the University of Washington team described an experimental system called ''Vanish'' predicated on the idea of scattering the parts of an encryption key on a publicly accessible peer-to-peer file sharing network in such a way that the key -- a large number -- would become unusable as pieces of it were lost from the network.   The Vanish researchers had argued that increasingly in a networked world sensitive discussions involving something like a divorce or a lawsuit threaten users' privacy when they are archived on multiple systems. Encrypting such messages is only a partial solution, the researchers argued, because encryption systems can be broken or keys can be subpoenaed. Therefore, it is virtually impossible to reliably delete information that has been transmitted via the Internet.   The Vanish attackers have created a demonstration system they call ''Unvanish'' and they said they had undone the Vanish model for gradually eroding encryption keys by subverting the peer-to-peer file sharing system. Their insight was to use a single computer to masquerade as a large number of members of a file sharing network. That rogue machine would simply need to capture and store anything that looked like a Vanish key fragment. The researchers said that this was simple, as the Vanish fragments are identifiable because of their size. Later it would be possible to reconstruct a Vanish message by simply consulting the Unvanish archive.   ''In our experiments with Unvanish, we have shown that it is possible to make Vanish messages 'reappear' long after they should have 'disappeared' nearly 100 percent of the time,'' the researchers wrote on a Web site that describes their experiment.   According to Emmett Witchel, a U.T.-Austin computer scientist, such technical jousting matches are at the very heart of both the computer security and cryptography fields.    ''The goals of the Vanish researchers are reasonable goals,'' he said, ''but their system is fundamentally flawed.'' The scheme would not be saved by trying to mask the size of the individual fragments, he added. ''It would make the attack a little bit more expensive, but it doesn't change the basic nature of the problem.''   On Monday, the Vanish researchers responded that they had now modified their initial prototype to use multiple file sharing networks, complicating the task of an attacker.   ''The newly discovered weaknesses with our initial research prototype are not an invalidation of Vanish,'' said Tadayoshi Kohno, a University of Washington computer scientist. "
"Rival Sues Hilton Hotels, Claiming Theft of Proprietary Data","Starwood Hotels  & Resorts Worldwide sued Hilton Hotels and two senior executives in federal court on Thursday, claiming confidential information had been stolen during Hilton's pursuit of a new ''lifestyle'' chain.    Ross Klein, head of luxury & lifestyle brands, and Amar Lalvani, head of development for the segment, were the Hilton executives named in the suit, which was filed in Federal District Court in New York. Both had been Starwood executives closely involved in the company's W Hotels brand before being hired by Hilton last year. Hilton was taken private in 2008 in a leveraged buyout by the Blackstone Group.   Hilton said in March that it would start a brand called Denizen, with developments planned in cities including Beverly Hills, Calif., and Abu Dhabi. The suit seeks to stop the projects as well as monetary damages.   ''Hilton Hotels Corporation is aware that a lawsuit has been filed, but we have not yet seen a copy. We will respond appropriately in due course,'' a Hilton spokeswoman, Ellen Gonda, said in an e-mail message.   The complaint said the two executives ''stole massive amounts of proprietary and highly confidential Starwood information which was used to expedite Hilton's entry into the lifestyle hotel market, reposition its luxury brands and substantially reduce its costs and risks of doing so.''

China May Ease Charges of Rio Tinto Workers,"China's investigation into whether four employees of the British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto stole state documents may be treated as a commercial case rather than an espionage case, Australia's foreign affairs minister said Sunday.    In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the minister, Stephen Smith, suggested that the four employees, including one Australian, could be spared the more serious spying charges. The employees were detained in Shanghai on July 5 on suspicion of espionage.   Mr. Smith could not be reached Sunday for clarification. But if China pursues the lesser charges, it will be an important turnaround in a case that has strained Australia's relations with China for two weeks. China has released few details about the case but has insisted that the four Rio Tinto employees stole state secrets, engaged in espionage and harmed the economic security and interests of the nation.   Australian and American officials are pressing China for details of the case amid worries about the employees' treatment and fears that global companies doing business in China could face legal difficulties when dealing with Chinese companies.    In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Smith said the employees could still face criminal charges of misconduct during Rio Tinto's iron ore negotiations with Chinese steel executives earlier this year.   The Chinese government charges that the employees had bribed Chinese steel mill executives in exchange for confidential government data.    ''It's quite clear they are focusing on a criminal or judicial investigation related to the 2009 iron ore negotiations,'' Mr. Smith said, according to a transcript of the interview. ''That is their clear focus; they're not interested in what we would regard as espionage or national security matters. These are commercial and economic matters, which, under their general definition of state secrets, is included.''   Rio Tinto could not be reached for comment on Sunday. But on Friday, it released a statement defending its employees.   Legal experts say that China's state secrets law is difficult to defend against because a suspect is not allowed to meet with a lawyer until charges are filed. Since being detained two weeks ago, Stern Hu, the Australian employee who is Rio Tinto's top iron ore executive in China, has not been visited by his family or a lawyer, Australian officials said.   Australia wants China to expedite Mr. Hu's case. Chinese officials have promised to release information if charges are filed, Australia's government said. "
HSBC Says Employee Stole Client Data,"The banking company HSBC Holdings said Wednesday that an employee had stolen client data from its Swiss private bank in 2006 and 2007.   Later, the French budget minister, Eric Woerth, confirmed a newspaper report that the HSBC employee had passed stolen information to French tax authorities.    HSBC said the  employee, who was no longer with the bank, had been working for its information technology department and the theft was reported  after a period of police surveillance in 2008.    ''To the best of the bank's knowledge, the number of names potentially involved is less than 10,'' HSBC said. ''The bank filed a criminal complaint with the Swiss authorities in accordance to Swiss law.''   Switzerland's banks have come under pressure from foreign authorities this year, prompting the country to relax its cherished bank secrecy and comply with international standards.   A bitter dispute between the United States tax authorities and UBS damaged the Swiss industry's reputation and forced the banking giant to agree to hand over the names of about 4,450 clients to Washington.    The HSBC case recalls a larger theft at Liechtenstein's main bank LGT in which stolen data ended up with German tax authorities and sparked a huge investigation into tax evasion.   A spokesman for HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) said the bank had not communicated the theft to the clients involved.   The French newspaper Le Parisien reported earlier that the HSBC data stolen by the former employee had been included on a list of 3,000 suspected tax evaders obtained by France.   ''He came to see the tax authorities, and the tax authorities checked that the information was reliable,'' Mr. Woerth  said. He said the person had not been  paid for the information. "
San Antonio Built Community Coalition to Land Cyberwarfare Headquarters,"When Kelly Air Force Base was ordered shut down in 1995, more than 17,000 jobs left town. Now the military presence is growing again. This time, though, the new force will not comprise fighters, bombers or boots on the ground. Instead, the city is hosting the fastest-growing domain of government and military spending: cyberwarfare.    The Air Force's new military command for computer-network offense and defense, activated in late summer, is expected to require 5,500 to 7,000 jobs, including Air Force personnel, Defense Department civilians and private-sector contractors.    Lackland Air Force Base here was named home for the new Air Force cyberwarfare operation after a competition that pitted San Antonio against communities with better-known  bases in Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Nebraska and Virginia.    In fact, when the Air Force began looking for a place to base its new headquarters for computer-network warfare, officially called the 24th Air Force, San Antonio was not even on the list.   ''But we had a secret weapon -- a lot of retired colonels, lieutenant colonels and majors who had shed their uniforms and now are in key positions at the Chamber of Commerce and all across the business community,'' said John B. Dickson of Denim Group, a computer software and network security firm here. ''They were able to make the business case very strongly in San Antonio's favor.''    The Obama administration this year elevated computer-network warfare to be its high frontier of national security priorities, with far-reaching effects on military operations -- and how the Pentagon does business.   San Antonio's experience in lobbying for the new headquarters proved how the traditional ''Iron Triangle'' of military contracting -- the Pentagon, Congress and the military industry -- is being replaced by a new silicon circle that requires harnessing the efforts of municipal governments, business leaders and universities to ride the next wave of large military contracts.   ''You have to pull together all the disparate interests in your community -- academic interests, public-sector utilities, the military, other federal agencies already operating in town and the business community,'' said Matt Pirko of ManTech Security and Mission Assurance, another local computer-network firm.    Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, said community leaders found it easy to sell the lobbying effort, not just in Washington but to their own citizens. San Antonio has a history of energetically supporting its military bases, he said. But even more, cyberoperations are viewed as a more intellectual and clean, even ''green,'' sector of the American military than traditional combat.   Mr. Castro said the effort to sway decision makers was built on arguments that San Antonio not only offered excellent computer security expertise and the municipal infrastructure to support it, but was producing network warriors for the future through new programs at its high schools and local colleges.   Ravi Sandhu, executive director of the Institute for Cyber Security, at the University of Texas at San Antonio, said the recession had forced the state to cut back money for a number of academic programs, but not in computer security, and not here.   One draw for the Air Force was the institute's Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security, which developed the ''Dark Screen'' exercise adopted by municipalities in 11 states to learn how to protect critical city infrastructure from computer-network attacks.   The center's assistant director, Dwayne Williams, said his program was being used in so many cities, including several that competed for the new Air Force command, that his organization was prohibited from assisting hometown officials in making the pitch to the Air Force because of insider knowledge on weaknesses in computer security systems of those other cities.   At Lackland Air Force Base, signs have been going up, identifying the new 24th Air Force headquarters and its subordinate units, the 688th Information Operations Wing and the 67th Network Warfare Wing. The new headquarters will command two other communications groups, based in Galveston, Tex., and Oklahoma City.   Maj. Gen. Richard E. Webber, commander of the 24th Air Force, said the choice of San Antonio was based on ''proximity to other cyberoperational missions, as well as access to communications and bandwidth capabilities, infrastructure and the local scientific and technical base.''    It did not hurt that the National Security Agency already has significant operations in San Antonio, including a unit of its Central Security Service, whose missions include protecting government computer systems and producing foreign signals intelligence.   Within the alphabet soup of American spy agencies, the N.S.A. takes the lead in electronic intelligence and computer-network warfare. Its director is expected to be assigned the second task of being in charge of the Pentagon's new United States Cybercommand, overseeing militarywide computer-network operations. The 24th Air Force will be the service's operation in support of that command's mission. "
Uproar Over China's Rule On Software Filter for PCs,"China is facing a storm of protest at home and abroad over new regulations requiring all personal computers sold in the country to include software that can filter out pornography and other ''vulgar'' content from the Internet.    Industry executives, free-speech advocates and many computer users have reacted angrily to the new mandate, which gives manufacturers until July 1 to preinstall the software on millions of new machines.     ''The compulsory installation of filtering software is a whole lot of useless flopping about,'' said an editorial in The Wuhan Evening News.   Computer makers in the United States say it will be impossible to fulfill the requirement by the end of the month and have asked the Chinese government to reconsider the directive. They say it raises thorny questions about censorship and whether manufacturers will be liable if the software -- designed by a company with ties to China's military and public security agencies -- conflicts with operating systems or causes computers to crash.    ''To be honest, nobody really knows what this software is capable of,'' said one executive at an American computer maker who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his company was still trying to work with the government on the issue. Computer experts fear that it could allow the government to monitor Internet use and collect personal information.    So far, the government has not shown any signs of backing down. On Tuesday, state-owned media and officials defended the new software, known as Green Dam, and said suggestions that it could be turned into government-operated spyware were exaggerated.    ''If you have children or are expecting a child, you could understand the concerns of parents over unhealthy online content,'' Qin Gang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a regular news conference Tuesday.    Bloggers, dissidents and even some normally cautious state media outlets have greeted the announcement with skepticism, questioning the software's reliability and wondering whether it could be used to censor nonsexual content. Some criticized the government's decision to spend about $6 million on a program that was not solicited through an open bidding process.    China vigorously restricts Internet content, regularly blocking Web pages devoted to Tibetan independence, human rights issues and other politically sensitive subjects. An anti-vulgarity campaign this year has shut down thousands of pornographic sites.    Green Dam's designers say the program, which uses image recognition technology and text filtering to block material, is not capable of acting as spyware. Most important, they say the program can be disabled or erased.    The Beijing News devoted a full page to Green Dam and found its performance less than stellar. For example, an innocent math question that included the word ''balls'' was filtered out.    Writing on Green Dam's own Web site, one teacher said sexually explicit images slipped through and another complained that it would not let her view pictures of pigs.    In an editorial he wrote for The Oriental Morning Post, Wang Lin, an associate professor at Hainan University Law School, said the government should have consulted computer users and allowed other companies to submit comparable programs. ''They've made a decision affecting tens of millions of people without regard to their opinions,'' he said in an interview. ''It's like you buying a car and the government telling you where you can drive.''    Executives at computer makers, which last year sold about 40 million PCs in China, agree with such sentiments, although none were willing to speak on the record for fear of angering the government as they press their case behind the scenes to have the rule reconsidered.    The government presented the regulations,  drawn up without industry input, to PC makers on May 19, but they were not released publicly until Monday.    Preliminary tests by software technicians at a number of companies have revealed significant software tics that could affect a computer's operating system or other programs, according to the American computer executive who spoke anonymously.    On Tuesday, a coalition of United States trade associations issued a statement that gently made their case.    ''We believe there should be an open and healthy dialogue on how parental control software can be offered in the market in ways that ensure privacy, system reliability, freedom of expression, the free flow of information, security and user choice,'' read the statement, which was signed by groups including the Software & Information Industry Association and the Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include Lenovo, Dell, Apple and Hewlett-Packard.    While bloggers have been among the most incensed by the new rules, one, Wang Xiaofeng, said he was not overly concerned the software would have a lasting impact on Internet freedom.    ''People will always find a way to break through these controls,'' he said. ''It's just a shame the government has to keep spending taxpayer money to build them.'' "
T.L.C. to Help an Old Laptop Overcome Its Age,"I'm about to tell a tale of woe that I haven't told anyone else, one that befits this ghoulish season.   As new parents, my wife and I installed a system of locks on our cabinets and drawers. The locks contained magnets and could be unlocked using a larger, more powerful magnet, thus hermetically sealing the drawers -- and keeping their contents safe from little hands.   One evening, after a day of diaper changes and running after toddlers, I picked up the heavy unlocking magnet. Then, in the same hand, I picked up my laptop. For those familiar with computers, the next part of the story will elicit a groan: the magnet came close to the hard drive inside the computer and I gasped. The magnet interfered with the hard drive's internal machinery and it immediately stopped whirring. The screen froze and no number of reboots would bring it back.    My laptop was dead.   When a desktop computer loses its horsepower or, worse, crashes entirely, it seems a shame to throw it away, and often unnecessary: even the most timid computer user can add a U.S.B. hard drive or connect a new monitor.   But when a laptop dies, it seems like it's the end of the line. However, new online stores and easy upgrades mean that wounded laptops can, like mine, be healed.   PREVENTIVE MEDICINE Doing a good cleanup is usually a good idea when trying to give an older laptop a new lease on life. Compressed air is great for blowing out stray strands of hair or dust in the keyboard and DVD drive, and rubbing alcohol will clean up most surfaces.   Now that the outside is clean, you can look at the operating system. Most systems fail or slow down because of faulty software. Windows 7, the new operating system from Microsoft arriving Thursday, will include virus and spyware removal software. But if you have an older system, you can download Avast antivirus software (at avast.com) and AdAware (at lavasoft.com), two free programs that work to clear up unruly computers. Mac users, luckily, have little to fear from spyware and viruses.   COMMON PROCEDURES If things are still broken -- or you're not happy with the results -- a fresh installation of the operating system may be in order. However, if the problem is deeper in the hardware -- perhaps a balky hard drive or too little memory -- there is hope.   First let's talk about laptop architecture.    Most laptops consist of a motherboard hidden underneath the keyboard, and thus inaccessible to mere mortals, and peripherals intended for easy access. The meaning of ''easy access'' varies according to manufacturer, but generally the memory and hard drive are accessible through panels on the bottom or side of the case.   A word of warning: many do-it-yourself upgrades or repairs can void warranties and, given the wide variety of laptops out there, there is no defined set of steps to follow in order to perform these improvements.   LOSS OF MEMORY, DISORIENTATION If you are dealing with a hard-drive problem, the symptoms will include start-up failure as well as slowness and ''grinding'' -- essentially unnecessary reading and writing to the disk -- as well as warnings that you're running out of disk space. If you have a more severe problem, however, the system will fail to boot or start up completely, giving you an error about a missing operating system. This is true for both Macs and PCs.   Most laptops run faster when given a little more memory, so a general upgrade is always a good idea. However, problems with memory are often quite nefarious and result in frequent crashes while working, resulting in freezes. Memory problems, therefore, are much harder to diagnose. Best to consult a professional.    A NOTE ABOUT INSURANCE Be sure to back up your computer before trying any fixes because no upgrade is foolproof. You should always hope for the best but expect the worst when fooling around with hardware.   TRANSPLANT ELIGIBILITY The first step is to find your laptop model online and divine what type of memory and hard drive it takes. For Apple laptops, check out sites like ifixit.com or macsales.com. IFixIt offers step-by-step instructions for adding memory and hard drives to almost any Macintosh model.   Windows users might face a bit more trouble trying to find tear-down manuals for their laptops. A quick online search, however, will bring up the size and models compatible with your particular laptops.   Crucial.com offers a fairly comprehensive database of memory chips and compatible laptops, allowing you to select your model and buy the appropriate memory.    Hard drives are a bit trickier, but there are only two types to worry about: Parallel ATA (PATA) and Serial ATA (SATA). Both come in 2.5-inch models to fit inside a laptop's smaller hard-drive bay. One rule of thumb: older computers run PATA; newer ones run the more compact SATA standard.    If your computer has been around for over two years, chances are you have a PATA hard drive. Sites like newegg.com and tigerdirect.com specialize in cheaper hard drives for laptops.   TRANSFUSIONS You will need to restore your files and applications from your old drive. So you will need a U.S.B. to IDE/SATA adapter ($29, pcconnection.com), a device that plugs into your old hard drive and connects to the computer via U.S.B.    The old drive then appears as an external U.S.B. drive, allowing you to drag off important files. If you have a backup drive, however, you can simply restore your data as the software instructs.   EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES More complex repairs require a bit more planning and care. But keyboards, trackpads and screens are probably within the realm of possibility for consumers who want to do at-home repairs. Once I found my laptop under the sofa with a large, decidedly male footprint on it. I won't say whose boot it was that stomped my laptop, but the resulting pressure cracked the laptop's screen and drove me to eBay, where I found a new part for quick installation.   Some of these repairs are a piece of cake, but many require careful prying, prodding and pushing at delicate plastic parts and sometimes the results aren't quite right. That broken laptop monitor, for example, never worked right and needed a good rap on the side to light up every few hours.   Not everyone has a knack for home laptop repair. But with a little research -- along with a few fine screwdrivers and plenty of patience -- even a misstep or powerful magnet doesn't have to mean the end of your laptop's long and fruitful life. "
Article Says Murdoch Newspapers Paid to Settle Cases of Hacking Into Cellphones,"A British newspaper, The Guardian, reported on Wednesday that Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper subsidiary paid  about $1.6 million to settle court cases involving allegations that its reporters worked with private investigators to hack into the cellphone messages of numerous public figures. Among those whose cellphones were tapped or hacked into were the former deputy prime minister and at least one other cabinet minister, The Guardian reported.   The Guardian's report was denied by Mr. Murdoch, whose News Corporation  owns the Fox Broadcasting Company in the United States as well as The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. Bloomberg News quoted Mr. Murdoch as saying on Wednesday that he was not aware of any payments made to settle legal cases in which the company's reporters in Britain might have been involved in criminal activity.    ''If that had happened, I would know about it,'' he said.   The Guardian report could not be independently verified. The newspaper cited an unnamed ''senior source'' at Scotland Yard as saying that staff members at News International, the Murdoch subsidiary that owns four major newspapers in Britain, including The Times of London, The Sunday Times and two  tabloids, The News of the World and The Sun, had used private investigators to hack into ''thousands'' of cellphones to obtain confidential personal data, including tax records, social security files, bank statements and itemized telephone bills. It cited another source ''with knowledge of the police findings'' as saying that the investigators had tapped ''two or three thousand'' cellphones.    The Guardian article, citing those sources, said that the targets of the hacking included John Prescott, who was deputy to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, and a cabinet member,  Tessa Jowell, as well as lawmakers from all three of Britain's major political parties. Accessing stored phone messages covertly is illegal in Britain, except for the police or intelligence agencies acting with a warrant.    The Guardian said Scotland Yard files also showed that the  newspapers had used private investigators to approach government agencies, banks, phone companies and other agencies that, the paper said, were conned into handing over confidential information on politicians, actors, athletes, musicians and television presenters, all of whom are named in the files. The Guardian said the files named 31 reporters working for The News of the World and The Sun in connection with the operation.   In the past few months, Britain has been rocked by scandals related to the use of expense accounts by members of Parliament, but The Guardian did not explain how or if the information it obtained was used, or if it had any relation to the scandals.   The Guardian article caused an immediate uproar, with demands from politicians and others for the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown to order a police investigation and to explain why earlier police inquiries had not resulted in any action against the Murdoch-owned papers.   Simon Hughes, a prominent lawmaker for the Liberal Democrats, an opposition party, who was among those named by the Guardian as having had their cellphone messages tapped, said that if The Guardian's story was accurate, those responsible should be ''severely punished.'' He told the BBC that The Guardian's revelations amounted to ''a very big warning bell'' of the damage that could be done by exploiting the possibilities of ''the new data-centered age.''   The Guardian cited no sources for its claim that News International, the Murdoch subsidiary, had paid $:1 million, about $1.6 million, in damages and legal costs to three people involved in professional  soccer in Britain, including about $1.1 million to Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association.    The Guardian said the financial settlements in Britain were accompanied by clauses that prevented the people receiving the money from speaking about the cases. Such confidentiality clauses are common in many settlements. It said the settlements arose from disclosures that emerged from a trial of two private investigators working for the Murdoch-owned News of the World who served brief prison terms after being convicted in 2007 for hacking into cellphone messages.   One of the men convicted, Clive Goodman, was found to have accessed more than 600 messages on cellphones used by members of the royal family. The other man, Glenn Mulcaire, a former professional soccer player, admitted  that he had hacked into the cellphone of Mr. Taylor, head of the soccer association, as well as those of the model Elle Macpherson  and Max Clifford, a public relations agent.     In documents submitted to the High Court in London during the trial of Mr. Goodman and Mr. Mulcaire, executives of News International said The News of the World's editors and reporters had not been involved in any way in the phone tapping.   But the controversy stirred by The Guardian could  reach into the highest ranks of Mr. Murdoch's empire. Several senior executives at News International or The News of the World were named by The Guardian as having denied knowledge of the tapping during the Goodman-Mulcaire trials.  "
"After Tabloid's Tactics Are Revealed, Britain Confronts Cloaked Journalism","Perhaps the most surprising thing about the accusations this week that a British tabloid newspaper had routinely hacked into the cellphone messages of celebrities, sports figures and politicians is how widespread, even accepted, such dubious journalistic methods are in Britain.   ''They will go to any lengths to get material: pretending to be someone they're not, dressing as the gasman to get into someone's home, paying neighbors, going through trash bins, convincing relatives that the person has given them permission to talk,'' the anchor of Channel 4 News, Jon Snow, said of British tabloid reporters.     The focus this week has been on a particular paper, The News of the World, which is owned by News International, the British subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The paper was accused by another newspaper, The Guardian, of hiring private investigators to hack into the cellphone messages of thousands of people.   The Guardian also reported that The News of the World had paid more than $1.6 million in out-of-court settlements to three people whose phones had been hacked into. One of them was identified as Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, who, The Guardian said, received $1.1 million. On Friday, The Guardian identified a second person, Jo Armstrong, a legal adviser for the soccer group, as another recipient.    As part of the settlement, The Guardian said, the three people had agreed not to discuss the case.    In a long and artfully worded rebuttal issued Friday, News International laid out a list of accusations by The Guardian that it said were ''irresponsible,'' ''unsubstantiated'' and ''false.''    But the statement left many questions unanswered. And it did not address the most serious accusation: that News International had paid damages to Mr. Taylor, Ms. Armstrong and the third person.    In its own statement, Guardian Media Group, The Guardian's parent company, took note of the nondenial. ''We are pleased that News International has, for the first time, confirmed its out-of-court settlement with Gordon Taylor over the illegal interception of his phone messages,'' the company said.   The disclosures have come against a darkening political mood in Parliament. As much as they may revile the tabloids, British politicians fear their power and are generally loath to cross them. But with relations at a low ebb following weeks of revelations in the newspapers about how British lawmakers had abused their expense accounts, some members of Parliament evidently feel that the time has come to exact revenge.    ''Politicians are very angry with journalism as a whole because of what happened over the expenses scandal,'' said a newspaper columnist with close ties to the Conservative Party. ''Anything they can do to hammer journalism as a whole, they will do.''    One punitive response may be to enact a law on personal privacy, which many victims of media overreach have long called for. The media currently regulates itself, under the auspices of the Press Complaints Commission, which sets a code of conduct and is supposed to ensure that newspapers abide by it. But it is generally seen as weak.    ''There are a lot of angry parliamentarians who may use this story to crystallize some sort of draconian privacy law, which would inevitably protect the rich and powerful rather than the man on the street,'' said William Lewis, editor of The Daily Telegraph, the newspaper that revealed the misuse of expense accounts by members of Parliament in an extensive series of articles in spring. ''Relations between the political class and the media class have never been so bad.''   The Daily Telegraph paid an undisclosed sum for the expense account records, whose release had not been authorized.   Meanwhile, a House of Commons committee that has been examining the media's conduct and was due to release a report soon has said that it will hold hearings in light of The Guardian's reports.    Among those it will call to testify, committee members said, are three current and former officials in News International.    They are Les Hinton, the former head of News International who is now the chief executive of Dow Jones; Rebekah Wade, a former editor of The News of the World who now edits The Sun, another of Mr. Murdoch's tabloids, and who is to become the new chief executive of News International in September; and Andy Coulson, who was editor of The News of the World when much of the misbehavior described by The Guardian was said to have occurred, and who is now the communications director of the Conservative Party.   Paul Farrelly, a Labour member of Parliament who is on the committee, said one of the difficulties of regulating the British newspaper industry was that it included responsible newspapers as well as ''an increasingly feral tabloid press.''    ''Striking a balance, with the schizophrenic nature of the U.K. press, is always going to be difficult, but it is an issue that needs to be addressed,'' he said.  "
Editor Says A Murdoch Paid to Settle On Phone Tap,"The editor of News of the World, a London tabloid, told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that James Murdoch, the son of the media baron Rupert Murdoch, had approved a $1.1 million payment to settle phone-tapping allegations against the paper.    The case -- in which the payment was made to Gordon Taylor, the head of the Professional Footballers' Association -- was settled at a 2008 meeting  among James Murdoch; Colin Myler, the editor of News of the World; and Tom Crone, a company lawyer, Mr. Myler told a committee of the House of Commons, Bloomberg News reported.   ''It was an agreed collective decision,'' Mr. Myler told the committee, according to Bloomberg. ''It's how newspapers work.''   The testimony on Tuesday  followed  a report in The Guardian  newspaper two weeks ago that suggested two tabloid newspapers owned by the News Corporation, the media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch, had engaged in the widespread use of private investigators to illegally hack into the cellphone messages of public officials and celebrities in Britain.  News Corporation has denied the allegations.   Shortly after The Guardian article was published, Rupert Murdoch told Bloomberg News that he was unaware of any such payment. ''If that had happened,'' he said, ''I would know about it.''    A  News Corporation spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday.   The case involving Mr. Taylor emerged after the 2007 conviction of Clive Goodman, then the editor responsible for News of the World's coverage of the royal family, on charges that he had hacked into the cellphones of three of its members. Mr. Goodman received a four-month prison sentence. Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator hired by News of the World, received a six-month sentence. Andy Coulson, who was editor of the paper during the hacking, resigned.    When The Guardian article was published, it caused an uproar in Britain and shined a light on the practices often used by British tabloid journalists. For example, a 2006 report published by the British information commissioner concluded that newspapers commonly hired private investigators. After The Guardian article, Scotland Yard said it would not reopen the matter, adding that it conducted a thorough inquiry three years earlier.   Many editors in London say that newspapers have largely ended the practice. Since the Goodman case, News of the World has enforced a code of conduct that prohibits reporters from hiring private investigators. "
"Steps to Prevent Identity Theft, and What to Do if It Happens","Identity theft is not just  an unauthorized charge on a credit card anymore.    Identity theft, according to the Federal Trade Commission, ''occurs when someone uses your personally identifying information, like your name, Social Security number or credit card number, without your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes.''    How your information is stolen, and how it is used, varies greatly. With stolen Social Security numbers, thieves are filing false medical claims, applying for mortgages and opening lines of credit for fictitious businesses. By adding fake fronts onto A.T.M.'s or gas pumps, they are collecting credit card numbers and PINs.    But while the trade commission estimates that nine million Americans are victims of some sort of identity theft each year, these extreme cases of identity fraud remain rare, luckily.     You may find that you will need only to close a compromised account or freeze your credit if errors appear. But recovering from the effects of an extreme case of identity theft can be incredibly messy and time-consuming. You could be denied a mortgage, for example, or  refused new lines of credit. It can take months or even years to repair your credit history, and this type of crime is  hard to prosecute.    While financial institutions, health care companies and other organizations have taken steps to improve security measures in recent years, do not rely on them to protect you. Taking some common-sense steps now can help prevent major headaches later.    PREVENTION Your first step should be to review monthly statements from your checking and other financial accounts. The earlier you catch an error, the easier it is to resolve it. Yes, balancing your checkbook may seem  a monotonous chore, but understanding where your money goes will help you spot any irregular withdrawals or charges. Reviewing your credit card bill each month is critical as well, especially if you charge a lot of your daily purchases. If you have not already, this may be a great time to sign up for online accounts. It's easier and faster to review accounts online, on a computer you trust.    Next, order and review your credit reports. The three credit agencies, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, are each required by law to provide you one free credit report a  year. AnnualCreditReport.com has links to all three, and it is the only place to get them  free. (Other sites may try to charge you or get you to sign up for monthly services of some sort.) Stagger your requests, and you can monitor your credit history every four months. While you are at it, make sure your name, address and other information are correct. If you find old or inaccurate information, have it removed.    While companies like your health care provider are no longer printing Social Security numbers on member identification cards, a lot of personal information is still out there. Be sure to shred old bank statements, applications for new credit cards and other documents that have personal information.    Secure your personal information online and offline. Do not carry your Social Security card in your wallet. Keep it at home with your other important documents. Be careful about online passwords as well and change them often. And  be vigilant about sharing personal information when opening new accounts online. If online advertisements or offers seem too good to be true, they probably are.    ACTION The steps you will need to take to recover from identity theft  depend on the type of fraud you believe has occurred. If you are going through your monthly statements and see an error on an existing credit card, monthly bill or financial account, first call the company to report it.    By federal law, credit card companies have strong consumer protections in place, and they have large departments to investigate fraud. For that  reason, you may want to consider using   a credit card to  pay for online and major purchases. That will give you more protection than if you use a debit card, because the money comes directly out of your bank account when you use a debit card. Making purchases with a credit card provides a layer of protection.   Once you have reported the error and determined there is reason to believe a fraud has occurred, the Federal Trade Commission recommends that you place an initial fraud alert with one of the three major credit reporting agencies. (They are required by law to report the fraud alert to the other two agencies.) The alert, which remains on your credit report for 90 days, automatically entitles you to  a free copy of your report. Review this for any accounts you did not open or activity you did not conduct, and confirm that the report has your correct name, address and Social Security number.    Once you have determined that a fraud has occurred,  you should also file both a complaint form with the trade commission and an identity theft report with your local police department. And you should file these complaints if you see any new accounts on your credit reports that you did not personally open.     After you have filed the reports, make multiple copies of them and save the originals in a safe place. While identity theft is hard to prosecute, these documents will help you investigate your case with the credit agencies and the financial institutions you do business with. Filing with the trade commission may also provide you with certain protections. In addition, law enforcement may use your information in their identity theft investigations.    Depending on the severity of your situation, you may want to consider the second type of fraud alert. The initial alert, which is recommended if, say, you lose your wallet,  requires potential creditors to take certain steps to verify your identity before opening new accounts in your name. The extended fraud alert, which lasts seven years, requires creditors to contact you personally before new accounts are opened.    But there is one thing to remember: Fraud alerts help only when a thief is trying to open a new line of credit. They may not prevent a thief from using existing accounts or ordering new cards. Nor can they prevent the opening of a bank account or another account that does not require a credit check.    While they are different in each state, credit freezes are also available. When you place a freeze on your credit report, businesses and creditors cannot check your credit history unless  you temporarily lift the freeze. The cost of freezing your credit, the cost of thawing it temporarily and the rules on who can freeze their credit depend on the state.    Regardless of the severity of the problem, be  careful when you contact the companies of the compromised accounts or the accounts you think have been tampered with. While the level of risk varies  because of credit limit, credit history and other factors,  your credit score may be negatively affected if you choose to cancel credit card accounts. Inform the creditor that you have reason to suspect you are victim of fraud, and ask it for  the company's policy in  situations like these. One option is   to ask that the account be assigned a new  number. Another option, when contacting credit agencies, is to place a 100-word consumer statement on your credit report explaining the fraud. This statement will stay on your credit report as long as you want.   And again, be sure to get documentation on all of your conversations and interactions with these lenders.   EXTRA HELP In recent years, the three main credit agencies  -- and other companies as well --  began offering credit monitoring and identity fraud services for monthly or annual subscriptions. Some companies even offer identity theft insurance. Prices and services vary, but over all, the agencies promise to monitor your credit report and send alerts if any questionable activity is found.    Whether it is a wise idea  to sign up for such services depends on your wallet and your need for peace of mind. If you have already been a victim of identity theft and have had to spend a significant amount of time and resources to clean up your record, the services may  reassure you. But if you have not had any problems and you are already vigilant about reviewing your accounts, it may not be worth the money. "
"In W.N.B.A., Jersey Sponsorship Could Set New Standard","The Phoenix Mercury's new uniform no longer has the words Phoenix or Mercury.   Instead, the W.N.B.A.'s Mercury appears to have been renamed LifeLock, with the 10-inch-by-4-inch name of the identity-theft protection company stretching across the team's jerseys. A small Mercury logo (the planet, with an M) appears like a badge on the upper left of the jersey.   Taking a cue from international sports, where displaying corporate names on jerseys is standard, the Mercury on Monday will announce a three-year deal with Tempe, Ariz.-based LifeLock that is worth at least $1 million annually.    ''I think the league and all our owners embrace innovation,'' Donna Orender, the W.N.B.A. president, said. ''We're constantly looking at ways to showcase the value we bring to our partners. And when the Mercury and LifeLock connected, it rang bells.''   During an off-season when one franchise, the Houston Comets, folded and the remaining 13 cut their rosters to 11 players from 13, the W.N.B.A. authorized its teams to let companies place their names on the players' jerseys as part of broad sponsorship agreements. At least one other team is close to a similar deal.   Jay Parry, the president of the Mercury, said, ''We thought it was time we stepped outside the boundaries and bring additional value to our marketing partners.''   Todd Davis, a co-founder and chief executive of LifeLock, called the jersey sponsorship ''a dealmaker'' but would not specify its exact value.    Davis is known for publicizing his Social Security number to promote the effectiveness of LifeLock's identity-theft protection (a ploy that was not foolproof).   Putting company names on uniforms provide sponsors with nearly continuous exposure, as if the players were billboards in motion.    ''This is inventory that's not available any other place,'' said Rick Welts, president of the N.B.A.'s Phoenix Suns, which owns the Mercury. ''Every photograph, every piece of game footage becomes part of the picture.''   Davis said that although the Mercury and the W.N.B.A. did not have mass appeal, they had ''fanatical'' followers who appreciated the role of sponsors in the league.  (LifeLock is also the title sponsor of two Nascar Sprint Cup races.) ''Mercury fans have a real affinity for the sport,'' he said. ''They just go above and beyond to support it.''   He said recent findings from Javelin Strategy & Research gave LifeLock a demographic rationale for the deal: women are 26 percent more likely than men to be identity theft victims.    The jerseys of American professional and college teams have been largely devoid of corporate involvement except for smallish logos of the uniform makers. But with international soccer as a model, some teams in Major League Soccer and Women's Professional Soccer wear uniforms with corporate names.    David Carter, a professor of sports business at the University of Southern California, expects to see more American leagues marketing jersey space to sponsors.   ''The barriers will be reduced slowly in leagues that have rich traditions and storied histories,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''For newer domestic leagues, or even those that lack heritage, the ability to move forward with jersey sponsorship will be far easier and will happen sooner.'' But he said he could envision conflicts between athletes who endorse one brand and teams that sell sponsorship to a competitor.   The W.N.B.A. and its parent, the N.B.A., have discussed selling uniform space for three years, but the idea has gestated far longer. When N.B.A. executives traveled in the 1990s to expand the league's European business, the sight of players in jerseys with corporate names grew gradually less foreign, Welts said.   ''The rest of the world considers this business as usual and assumes this is the way professional sports teams market,'' Welts said. He said he was not worried about critics of LifeLock's name on the Mercury's jerseys. ''I'm sure some unenlightened 50-year-old white male sports-talk radio host will think this is a sign of the apocalypse,'' he said.   Said Davis: ''They do this in European ball. It's not a sellout.''   Davis said he expected to be criticized but he viewed the deal as the sort of ''disruptive marketing'' he likes. LifeLock's rapid growth has attracted 1.5 million members, as well as lawsuits accusing it of misleading claims about its service.  "
Reverse-Engineering Social Security Numbers,"Keeping your Social Security number (S.S.N.) secure is key to preventing identity theft and fraud. But there have always been bugs in the system. People have known for decades about the conventions that the Social Security Administration uses when issuing S.S.N.'s, and not long ago, scientists figured out how to use this information to determine from a given S.S.N. the birth date of the applicant and the state in which the number was issued. Thankfully, though, the reverse was not true: an unknown S.S.N. could not be determined from that data.    Until now. This year, Alessandro Acquisti, an economist, and Ralph Gross, a computer scientist, both at Carnegie Mellon, announced in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they had figured out how to predict a person's S.S.N. Their work was made possible, paradoxically, by steps the government took to prevent identity theft and fraud. Years ago, for instance, the administration decided to make public its Death Master File -- the list of every S.S.N. taken out of circulation, together with the name, birth date and state in which the deceased originally applied for a number. The release of the file was supposed to make it harder for criminals to hijack dead people's S.S.N.'s, since those numbers could be easily cross-checked. But it provided Acquisti and Gross with a data set that they could analyze for patterns in how the numbers are assigned.   In addition, starting in 1989 the government encouraged parents to register children with S.S.N.'s at birth -- instead of registering them anytime between birth and when they started a job. The intention, in part, was to prevent the theft of numbers that hadn't yet been claimed. One consequence, however, is that S.S.N.'s issued since then are even less randomly assigned than before -- and thus easier to crack.   Given a state and birth date, Acquisti and Gross were able to predict correctly all nine digits in an S.S.N. in 1,000 attempts or fewer, 8.5 percent of the time, which renders a sizable percentage of S.S.N.'s about as easy to crack as a three-number PIN. From there, it is possible to use publicly available tools like online instant credit-card approval sites to try combinations until the right number is confirmed.   "
"In China, New Limits On Virtual Currency","The buying and selling of the make-believe currencies used in online gaming has become so widespread that Chinese authorities fear it will affect the real economy.    To quell that threat, those authorities said on Tuesday that they had issued new regulations aimed at restricting the trade and use of virtual money.   China is one of the world's biggest markets for huge so-called multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft, and tens of millions of young people are believed to be trading virtual goods and credits for real goods and cash.    The coin of fantasy realms have already moved markets here. So-called QQ coins -- a form of currency produced by the Chinese Internet giant Tencent -- have sometimes risen sharply in value against China's official currency, the renminbi, alarming officials at the nation's Central Bank.   Some people have even traded virtual currencies in China, and exchanged them for clothes, cosmetics and other goods.   Last year, nearly $2 billion in virtual currency was traded in China, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. Some experts say they believe there is a much larger underground economy in the virtual world.   Most of China's big Internet companies -- like Sohu.com, Netease and Tencent -- have some gaming component and virtual currencies have grown up alongside many of them.   Some smaller gaming companies have even set up what are called virtual sweatshops, cramped quarters where young people play online games to earn credits that the companies then sell at a profit to overseas customers in Taiwan, South Korea and even the United States.   This practice is popularly known in the online gaming community as gold farming.   Many online marketplaces, like eBay and China's Taobao, even have online advertisements offering virtual goods for sale, like World of Warcraft gold coins and virtual swords for the game Legend of Swordmen.   Edward Castronova, a professor of telecommunications at Indiana University Bloomington who says he believes virtual currencies could pose a threat to world economies, applauded Beijing's move.   ''This action shows that at least one government is concerned about the way virtual worlds challenge its control of society,'' Professor Castronova said in an e-mail message Tuesday. ''As virtual currencies take over more and more purchasing power, control over the effective money supply shifts from the central bank to the game developers.''   On Tuesday, China said that new regulations would restrict the trading and use of virtual money, and that virtual currencies would be banned from being exchanged for goods.   The government also said it was moving to fight online gambling and disputes over virtual coins.   In a release, Beijing said that while virtual currencies had helped promote online gaming, they have ''also brought new economic and social problems.''   Beijing has repeatedly sought to tame the online gaming market with new regulations (and even Internet addiction camps) but the activity continues to grow.   The new rules, issued jointly last weekend by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Culture in Beijing, are the government's strongest effort yet to tame virtual money.   The regulations were widely circulated just as Beijing announced it would delay adoption of a widely criticized plan to install  software that was supposed to censor pornographic and other ''unhealthy'' Web sites in all personal computers sold in China.   Richard Ji, an Internet analyst at Morgan Stanley, released a brief report Tuesday saying he expected only limited financial impact on Chinese gaming companies because much of the trading in virtual currencies and goods does not occur on the sites of big, publicly listed gaming companies, he says; it occurs on other Web sites.

"At Checkout, More Ways to Avoid Cash or Plastic","For almost as long as Americans have been hearing about jetpacks and picturephones, they have been hearing that money -- bills, coins and plastic cards -- might cease to exist, or at least become a novelty.    Instead of leather wallets, consumers could, sooner than they think, carry virtual wallets, with their credit card and bank information stored on remote computers that are accessible everywhere and anytime. They could use them whenever they want to buy something, whether on the Web, on cellphones or at cash registers.    With a new cellphone application called ShopSavvy, for instance, a shopper can use the phone's camera to scan an item's bar code in a store to see if it is available for  less online. If so, the shopper can buy it with one click if they have already entered their credit card and shipping information on PayPal's Web site.    ''What we're trying to do and what we think is very important is to displace the use of cash or checks,'' said Scott Thompson, president of PayPal, which is a leader in digitizing money. ''We'll just have one wallet, and it lives in the cloud.''     PayPal says its service makes the checkout process more convenient and secure for both shoppers and merchants.   The way consumers pay for things has transformed only a few times. Coins replaced bartering, paper bills mostly replaced coins, and bank drafts and checks developed as an alternative to cash.    In the 1950s, the credit card was introduced, and today, Americans pay for more on plastic than they do in cash. Some airlines and restaurants, for instance, no longer accept cash. The coming evolution to digital money that is handled over the Web is under way, led by companies like PayPal, MasterCard and Visa, as well as start-up companies and retailers.  Some methods involve using a cellphone instead of a credit card, while others call for using a single password or code to tap into their credit cards.   ''It just keeps getting more and more convenient to get access to your money and to transfer it to someone else,'' said Lawrence H. White, a professor of economics at George Mason University who specializes in the history of money. ''When everyone has a cellphone, why reach into your wallet?''    Digital money has been promised for well over a decade. During the dot-com bubble, several companies tried and failed to come up with Web-based cash alternatives. Flooz and Beenz tried to create an Internet-only virtual currency, for example, and a company called CyberCash developed an unsuccessful service for online micropayments.    The biggest barrier is not technological. It is that Americans think credit cards are already a fine solution. For a nation that thrives on plastic, pulling out a credit or debit card is just as convenient as pulling out a cellphone. It is also expensive for retailers to install machines to scan cellphones, and many phones' screens are too reflective for scanners to read.    ''Where there's a paper system, it's not that difficult to beat cash with an electronic payment,'' said Tim Attinger, Visa's head of global product innovation. ''But in this country, we have yet to find the unique value proposition that's vastly superior to the existing ways that consumers are paying.''   Someday, scanners could recognize the pattern of blood vessels in a finger and connect it to a credit card number, according to Alvin and Heidi Toffler, consultants on economics and technology and authors of ''Revolutionary Wealth,'' a book about the ways in which wealth will be created in the future.    But while shoppers wait for that day to arrive, they will be touching, clicking and swiping cellphones and computer mice more often.    PayPal took a step toward making the virtual wallet more of a reality recently when it held a conference in San Francisco for 1,500 software developers to encourage them to incorporate PayPal into a Web or mobile application. Shoppers have spent $500 million in the last year using eBay's iPhone application, which is integrated with PayPal.    A start-up called iCents.net wants to give online publishers a way to charge viewers. For instance, readers could buy a $50 subscription using PayPal, and each time they read an article on a Web site, 50 cents would be subtracted.    A developer from Australia is building an application for a real estate company that would let tenants log on to the landlord's Web site to pay rent with a single click. A start-up company called MedPayOnline.com is making it possible for patients to pay medical bills with PayPal.   ''Opening up the payment systems in a flexible and frictionless way like PayPal is doing is a really big deal,'' said Dana Stalder, a venture capitalist at Matrix Partners. ''I think it will lead to innovation far beyond what anyone imagines today, and I think it will be the advent of the digital wallet that goes with you in all parts of your life.''    Big credit card companies have also been working on ways to use the Web and mobile phones to pay. MasterCard partnered with a start-up called Obopay to make it possible for people to transfer money with a text message. After they sign up for the service and link their MasterCard number to their cellphone number, they can send anyone money with a text message. Recipients who have an account receive the money immediately, and others open an account to receive the deposit.    In Malaysia, Visa has started installing chips in cellphones so people can swipe their phone instead of a credit card, though Mr. Attinger said that is unlikely to take off in the United States anytime soon.     Still, there is a lot of excitement about the idea of phones doubling as credit cards, and a few companies are trying this on a small scale in the United States. Starbucks created an iPhone application that lets people upload money and swipe their phone instead of a card at the cash register. A company called Bling Nation makes tags linked to  bank accounts that users  can stick on the back of  cellphones and tap on a point-of-sale terminal.    Pulling out a credit card may be as convenient as a phone when paying offline, but it can be more convenient to avoid pulling out the card at all when shopping on a computer or a phone.    Obopay and other start-ups, including Zong and Boku, let people link their cellphone and credit card numbers so they need only enter their 10-digit phone number when they want to buy a virtual good online.   In five years, the terminals for swiping credit cards at stores will probably be connected to the Web wirelessly, so people could use PayPal and similar services to pay offline as well, Mr. Thompson said. ''Offline is changing so rapidly, and the line is very blurry where off- and online meet today.''  "
"A Military Deception, Made Easier by a Reluctance to Ask Questions","  The thick-muscled man with close-cropped hair who called himself Rick Duncan seemed right out of central casting as a prop for a Democratic candidate running against Bush administration policies last fall. A former Marine Corps captain who suffered brain trauma from a roadside bomb in Iraq and was at the Pentagon during the Sept. 11 attacks. An advocate for veterans rights who opposed the war. An Annapolis graduate who was proudly gay. With his gold-plated credentials, he commanded the respect and attention of not just politicians, but also police chiefs, reporters and veterans advocates for the better part of two years.   Yet, except for his first name, virtually none of his story was true. In reality, he was Richard G. Strandlof, a charismatic drifter with a history of mental illness and petty crimes who had moved from Montana to Nevada to Colorado, assuming different names and identities along the way.    Last month, after actual veterans uncovered his deceptions, Mr. Strandlof, 32, was detained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and then arrested by the Denver police on an outstanding warrant for driving with a suspended license. The veterans group he helped create, the Colorado Veterans Alliance, has disbanded. And now Mr. Strandlof, apparently penniless, remains in jail on $1,000 bail.     He faces arraignment on Tuesday, while the F.B.I. continues an inquiry into whether his subterfuge violated federal laws.   The tale of how Mr. Strandlof managed to fool so many people for so long says much about the power of veterans in Colorado, a swing state with numerous military bases. Politicians who now shun him were eager to have him by their side a year ago, no questions asked. Antiwar groups like VoteVets.org embraced him as a valued spokesman. And real veterans buried doubts about him out of respect, they said, for his alleged service and injuries.   In an interview at the El Paso County jail in Colorado Springs, Mr. Strandlof did not deny his lies, attributing them to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, for which he said he had taken medication intermittently for several years. Politicians were drawn to him, he said, ''because the veterans population has validity that others don't.''   But he insisted that he had broken no laws and that his deception was in the service of good causes.    Many former friends, still furious about his betrayal, agree. He publicized the plight of homeless veterans, they say, skillfully guided people through the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the Veterans Affairs Department and spoke movingly about post-traumatic stress disorder.    ''What's so heartbreaking is he was doing some good things,'' said Hal Bidlack, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for Congress from Colorado last year on an antiwar platform. ''I just hope he's not undermined the agenda.''   Mr. Bidlack, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, said he met Mr. Strandlof at a poetry reading for veterans and was so impressed that he used him in two campaign commercials. It was easy to be deceived by Mr. Strandlof, he said.    In addition to a scar on his head, which he said was from an improvised explosive device in Fallujah, Mr. Strandlof had intimate knowledge of the Veterans Affairs system, spoke authoritatively about events in Iraq and had a knowing bumper sticker on his car that read, ''Got DD-214?'' -- a reference to the discharge papers for armed forces members leaving acting duty.   In the interview, Mr. Strandlof said he became fascinated with the plight of veterans after meeting a Vietnam veteran in Nevada several years ago and began obsessively studying the Internet and talking to veterans.    ''I would ask them, 'What is your story? How do you feel?' '' he said. Over time, he said, the persona of Rick Duncan emerged and grew stronger with each telling.    Mr. Strandlof said he had been awed at the impact his story -- including the post-traumatic stress disorder, or P.T.S.D. in military jargon, that he told people he suffered -- had on veterans when he told it at coffeehouses, meetings and political rallies after arriving in Colorado Springs in 2006. ''I would feel a moment of camaraderie that I myself have never experienced in my life,'' he said.    There were also things that made Mr. Strandlof seem not credible. He never mentioned what unit he served with. He claimed to have lost a finger, but had 10 digits. Minor details of his story would change from week to week.    ''We attributed that to his wounds and to his P.T.S.D., and so were all easy on him,'' said Joe Barrera, a Vietnam veteran whom Mr. Strandlof befriended.   Though Mr. Strandlof did not have a formal role on any campaign, he became a favorite of Democratic candidates, appearing at campaign events with Jared Polis, who won a seat in Congress from Boulder, and at events for Mark Udall, a representative subsequently elected to the Senate.    And at least one Republican, Representative Doug Lamborn, was taken in by his story. In May 2007, Mr. Strandlof told an aide to Mr. Lamborn that he was forming an advocacy group for younger veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The aide, Dale Anderson, was so impressed that he asked Mr. Strandlof to join the congressman's veterans advisory committee.   Mr. Strandlof later quit the committee, saying he disagreed with Mr. Lamborn's support for the Iraq war, and in the 2008 election backed his opponent, Mr. Bidlack, who lost.    Born in Montana, Mr. Strandlof was a bookish, chatty and highly intelligent child who showed no interest in things military, his grandfather, Richard K. Strandlof, said in a telephone interview. His father left when he was young and after his mother remarried, his stepfather did not adopt him, deeply hurting Mr. Strandlof, his grandfather said.    Between 1997 and 1999, he served prison time for forgery and passing bad checks, Montana court records show. He was briefly released on probation to his grandfather, but after violating the terms by telling him a lie, he was sent back to prison. The grandfather said he had not seen him since.   Mr. Strandlof said he became estranged from his family even earlier, when he came out to them about his sexuality as a teenager. After prison, he spent time in California and in Reno, Nev., where he said he worked at a casino and lived with a man he met on a gay Web site. That man, Jeremy Weed, said in an interview that by 2005 Mr. Strandlof was claiming to have served in the military, as well as to have been a graduate of Stanford.    In Nevada, Mr. Strandlof, then using his stepfather's name, Pierson, was arrested for failure to pay for a rental car. His case was handled in a special court for the mentally ill, which allows low-level felony charges to be dropped when treatment programs are completed, court records show.    Even as he was in and out of court, Mr. Strandlof was setting up a foundation to bring a Grand Prix race to the Reno-Lake Tahoe area. The venture failed, but the F.B.I. is now investigating whether Mr. Strandlof kept $25,000 said to have been raised for the race. Mr. Strandlof says he raised little money and kept none of it for himself.   His story began to fall apart in recent weeks when he falsely told officials at Fort Carson that he worked for Senator Udall. The base notified the senator's office of the claim, and aides relayed their concerns to members of the Colorado Veterans Alliance, who harbored their own suspicions. Some record checking showed that the man they knew as Rick Duncan had used the name Strandlof on a document. A call to Annapolis determined that he had not attended the Naval Academy. And a check of Marine Corps records showed that he had never served.   Days after news of his forged identity broke, veterans advocates, Congressional aides and elected officials who thought they knew him well remained shocked. One veteran was so angry that he created a Facebook page urging the Justice Department to indict Mr. Strandlof.   Many of those people are now wondering what motivated Mr. Strandlof. Some former friends say it was mental illness. But Mr. Weed said it was not so clear cut.   ''I think he was excited by the power and the attention he was getting,'' Mr. Weed said. ''I have a hard time thinking that anyone could care that much about veterans and do them that much harm.''  "
Twitter Tapping,"The government is increasingly monitoring Facebook, Twitter and other social networking sites for tax delinquents, copyright infringers and political protesters. A public interest group has filed a lawsuit to learn more about this monitoring, in the hope of starting a national discussion and modifying privacy laws as necessary for the online era.     Law enforcement is not saying a lot about its social surveillance, but examples keep coming to light. The Wall Street Journal reported this summer that state revenue agents have been searching for tax scofflaws by mining information on MySpace and Facebook. In October, the F.B.I. searched the New York home of a man suspected of helping coordinate protests at the Group of 20 meeting in Pittsburgh by sending out messages over Twitter.   In some cases, the government appears to be engaged in deception. The Boston Globe recently quoted a Massachusetts district attorney as saying that some police officers were going undercover on Facebook as part of their investigations.   Wired magazine reported last month that In-Q-Tel, an investment arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, has put money into Visible Technologies, a software company that crawls across blogs, online forums, and open networks like Twitter and YouTube to monitor what is being said.   This month the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Samuelson Law, Technology and Public Policy Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law sued the Department of Defense, the C.I.A. and other federal agencies under the Freedom of Information Act to learn more about their use of social networking sites.    The suit seeks to uncover what guidelines these agencies have about this activity, including information about whether agents are permitted to use fake identities or to engage in subterfuge, such as tricking people into accepting Facebook friend requests.   Privacy law was largely created in the pre-Internet age, and new rules are needed to keep up with the ways people communicate today. Much of what occurs online, like blog posting, is intended to be an open declaration to the world, and law enforcement is within its rights to read and act on what is written. Other kinds of communication, particularly in a closed network, may come with an expectation of privacy. If government agents are joining social networks under false pretenses to spy without a court order, for example, that might be crossing a line.   A national conversation about social networking and other forms of online privacy is long overdue. The first step toward having it is for the public to know more about what is currently being done. Making the federal government answer these reasonable Freedom of Information Act requests would be a good start. "
