Security Needs Evolve as Computing Leaves the Office,"SAN FRANCISCO - Five years ago, people still spoke of cloud adoption as if they had a choice. But at company after company, cloud computing facilities miles away have replaced computer rooms down the office hall, and what once seemed like a choice now looks like an inevitability.  Businesses are turning to the cloud - that nebulous term that describes computing and applications run remotely over the Internet - to handle their data and computing faster and cheaper, relying on providers like Amazon, Google, SoftLayer, Rackspace and others.  And many of the companies' employees are turning to consumer cloud services, like Google Docs and Dropbox accounts, to readily access files - work and personal ones - wherever they are, including at home or at the neighborhood Starbucks. A hitch to all this newfound speed and convenience? Security. In most cases, specialists say, cloud security still lags far behind the layers of physical and network security of computer rooms down the hall.   ""We're seeing growing confidence in the cloud - not because we magically solved the security problems - but because we've seen them put aside as operational practicalities trump security,"" said Hugh Thompson, the chief security strategist of Blue Coat Systems, a provider of security technology. But as the drumbeat of data breaches has intensified in recent years, cloud security start-ups have cropped up to offer secure, end-to-end encryption and authentication schemes, and to make sure corporate servers aren't talking to strangers. Last year's $3.2 billion cloud security services market is predicted to nearly triple by 2017, to $9.2 billion, according to a report last October by Infonetics, a market research firm. ""There's no more debate,"" said Rajat Bhargava, co-founder of JumpCloud, a cloud security start-up. ""When you don't own the network, it's open to the rest of the world, and you don't control the layers of the stack, the cloud - by definition - is more insecure than storing data on premises.""  The risks to cloud-stored data are all too familiar. The top method for cloud-based data compromises, Mr. Bhargava and other experts say, is stolen or cracked passwords. Hackers gained access to Target's data by stealing a vendor's login information. More recently, at eBay, hackers gained access to its entire customer database by stealing an employee's passwords.  Those cases, experts say, are increasingly the norm, not the exception. Getting a password can be easy. Hackers often just send an email to a corporate administrator or trusted vendor containing a malicious link. If clicked, the link can download password-stealing malware onto a machine, or redirect users to a fake webpage that baits them into entering their login credentials.  Because cloud providers aggregate data for so many companies, a breach of a cloud provider's account can start a costly chain reaction. That was the case at MongoHQ, a cloud provider, last year. An attacker stole a MongoHQ employee's password, gaining access to the company's customer database and its customers' social media accounts. In some cases, he even got access to customers' storage accounts with Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing offering, which stores vast amounts of data for companies worldwide. There are also unsettled legal issues. Microsoft is challenging the right of American authorities to compel it to turn over customer emails storied in an Irish data center. The court fight is being carefully watched by other big Internet companies, worried that the data of customers from other countries could be subject to seizure by American investigators, regardless of where that data was stored. The most basic defense, security experts say, is strong authentication schemes - and strong, unique passwords to different cloud applications are only the start. Security specialists recommend that companies enable multifactor authentication, perhaps requiring users to sign in with their password as well as a one-time code, like one texted to their phones or momentarily displayed on a security token.  But, security experts add, businesses would be wise to monitor where login requests are coming from. New security technologies offered by companies like ThreatMetrix and 41st Parameter can track where and from which machine a request is originating. A login request to an American company's human resources database may sound alarms if, say, its origin is an unrecognized I.P. address in China, or from a machine that relies on Russian language fonts.  Servers are also a hacking target, researchers say, and administrators must be vigilant about regular updates. Even with all those protections, computer security remains a cat-and-mouse game. Experts say companies would be wise to plan for the worst case - assuming that somebody with the will and wherewithal to steal data from a cloud provider will find a way. One option is to make the data unreadable, by encrypting it even before it reaches a cloud provider. Young companies like CipherCloud and Voltage Security offer encryption for data as it moves from employees' computers to the cloud.  But only a small percentage of businesses are employing such services, according to an April study by the Ponemon Institute, which studies data privacy. Over half of the 4,000 organizations the group studied admitted that they stored their most sensitive data unencrypted in the cloud.  With breach after breach, security experts say the status quo is simply no longer acceptable. ""Encryption is an overhead. It's a hassle; there's no great way to do it easily or simply, it causes performance issues and it's just a pain, but you have to do it,"" said Mr. Bhargava. In addition, experts say, companies should safely store the cryptographic keys that decipher their data - not a simple task.  Many companies store their keys on the servers the keys can decrypt - the digital equivalent of leaving the house key under the doormat. The risk of storing the keys in that way was demonstrated recently, when security researchers exploited the recently disclosed Heartbleed bug by pulling encryption keys off a server.  If there's any upside to the recent breaches, security experts say, it is that executives now have a greater awareness of the cloud's perils. Executives who once thought of themselves as gatekeepers now recognize that employees will find a way to use cloud services regardless of whether their company allows it, and that the company needs to take steps to protect the data that is stored and shared. ""There's been a mind shift,"" said Rajiv Gupta, the co-founder of Skyhigh Networks, a start-up that helps companies get a handle on rogue apps. ""Earlier, they felt that information technology had to be provided to employees. Now they're asking how to enable employees to use the cloud in a way that meets the organization's security, privacy and compliance requirements."" "
Keep Your Data All Yours,"Josh Shields, a corporate pilot, spends 180 days a year flying around the world, often to Asia and Europe. He carries two laptops, an iPad and two iPhones -- all of which, he realizes, are vulnerable to data breaches. For protection, he installs a virtual private network and disk encryption software, avoids doing any banking while on the road and limits himself to one email account.  Call him paranoid, but he sees it as being realistic. ''If you're traveling, be smart about what you are doing,'' said Mr. Shields, a 36-year-old Illinois resident, who flies executives throughout the United States, Asia and Europe. Public Wi-Fi accounts that do not require a password -- whether they are in a hotel room or lobby, coffee shop or an airport -- are particularly vulnerable. ''If you're looking at something, theoretically, everyone else can be, too,'' he said. Security experts agree that you cannot be too careful. If you are reading your next presentation in an airplane seat, someone sitting behind you may be, too. If you are carrying confidential files on your hard drive, they are vulnerable. And if you type a password into your mobile phone, someone may be capturing those keystrokes. Security and privacy issues fall into two main categories: those concerning data stored on a computer, and those related to information -- emails, attachments -- that are sent from and received at a computer. In either form, the data can be vulnerable. But travelers can take some simple steps to reduce the risks. TAKE ONLY WHAT YOU NEED The safest way to protect confidential information is to leave it at home. But if you must take it, carry the data on a memory stick. The more separation from a computer's hard drive, the better, experts say. As for the computer itself, do not use your regular one. Instead, ''take a loaner laptop, a temporary laptop,'' said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group for global online civil liberties. And when you return, especially from places like China or Russia, which have higher rates of hacking, ''wipe it before you connect it to your network or home or anything you care about,'' Mr. Hall said. USE ENCRYPTION If you carry your laptop, rely on disk encryption to protect electronic files. Before you travel, you or your company's information technology expert can install disk encryption software on your devices. If the entire hard drive is encrypted, a thief ''would get total gibberish,'' Mr. Hall said. On websites, ''https://'' at the beginning of the address indicates a site is encrypted, but it must be on each page to prevent vulnerability, according to the Federal Trade Commission. INSTALL A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK To protect the data that flows into and out of a laptop, iPad or iPhone, international travelers like Mr. Shields install a virtual private network. ''Internationally it allows me to connect to websites that some countries block,'' he said. ''China is a big one. A lot of U.S. websites are blocked when you are traveling in China -- Facebook, Yahoo, Google.'' Recently he has used WiTopia, a V.P.N. that protects data in transit from one computer, mobile phone or tablet to another by encrypting it. Bill Bullock, chief executive of WiTopia, a personal privacy and data security services company based in Reston, Va., said, ''Your data is not secure in the lobby of a hotel, in an airport, in a hotel room.'' GO FOR LAYERS When it comes to security, Gary A. Oster, an executive with the United States Travel Association, relies on layers to protect himself from digital thieves. These include a black jacket, with zip-off sleeves and a hood, that has pockets that block RFID -- radio-frequency identification -- he said. He also uses Dropbox to send files, and an iPhone 5S with a fingerprint sensor to confirm identity and the ability to create a personal hot spot. Mr. Oster, who travels five to 10 days a month on business within the United States, wants to protect his credit cards as well as data on his devices. ''I travel as light as possible -- light, connected and fully rechargeable,'' he said. ''I am a paperless guy.'' PREPARE FOR THE WORST In certain places like China, expect that your data may be observed by potential adversaries, said Jules Polonetsky, executive director and co-chairman of the Future of Privacy Forum, a think tank that promotes responsible data practices. THINK LOW-TECH To prevent a thief from turning on a camera or microphone, place a sticker over it. ''It's the low-tech solution for a high-tech problem,'' said Michelle Dennedy, vice president and chief privacy officer at McAfee, a security technology company. To prevent over-the-shoulder snooping, use a privacy screen. These guidelines are not foolproof, but security experts say every measure can help reduce the chances of cybertheft. ''There are no absolute remedies,'' said William Evanina, national counterintelligence executive at the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive, a government agency. ''Know what your competitors would want from you.'' he said, and aim to safeguard it by leaving that information at home. "
Mark Zuckerberg's Call To Obama Was Not About Privacy,"Mark Zuckerberg is not happy with the way the American government conducts surveillance on the Internet, so much so that he called President Obama to complain about it and then wrote a post Thursday on Facebook to vent his frustration. ""The U.S. government should be the champion for the internet, not a threat,"" he said.  Some observers have pointed out that Mr. Zuckerberg's comments are ironic because Facebook, the company he co-founded and runs, has a spotty record when it comes to protecting the privacy of its users. The company has been criticized for changing its privacy policy in ways that make it harder for users to control who can see the information that they have posted to the social network.  But it is worth noting that Mr. Zuckerberg never mentions the word ""privacy"" in his post. If you read carefully, what he is really complaining about is that the government's activities have made the Internet less secure. He doesn't spell it out, but Mr. Zuckerberg's post came after The Intercept reported that the National Security Agency has ""masqueraded as a fake Facebook server"" to hack into computers and steal files. (In a statement, the N.S.A. said that report was inaccurate.) Here is Mr. Zuckerberg: To keep the internet strong, we need to keep it secure. That's why at Facebook we spend a lot of our energy making our services and the whole internet safer and more secure. We encrypt communications, we use secure protocols for traffic, we encourage people to use multiple factors for authentication and we go out of our way to help fix issues we find in other people's services. The internet works because most people and companies do the same. We work together to create this secure environment and make our shared space even better for the world. This is why I've been so confused and frustrated by the repeated reports of the behavior of the US government. When our engineers work tirelessly to improve security, we imagine we're protecting you against criminals, not our own government. In other words, Mr. Zuckerberg has not really transformed into an advocate for greater privacy. He is just protecting the interests of his company. He doesn't want the surveillance activities of the government to cast a shadow on Facebook and other similar Internet services lest the public lose faith in their security. And that is a perfectly reasonable point for him to make. As far as the privacy goes, Mr. Zuckerberg has previously said that he doesn't think most people are as concerned about it as they once were. ""People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people,"" he said in a speech in 2010, as reported by the Guardian. ""That social norm is just something that has evolved over time.""  "
Will a Government Settlement Improve Snapchat's Privacy? Don't Count on It,"Snapchat just joined the F.T.C. club.  The company that makes the popular messaging app agreed on Thursday to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission of charges that it deceived users when it said photos on the service would ""disappear forever"" after recipients viewed them. In fact, the agency determined, access could be obtained to Snapchat's photos through a set of relatively simple workarounds. Under the terms of the deal, Snapchat agreed to be monitored by an independent privacy auditor for the next 20 years.  Such agreements have become something of a rite of passage for tech companies. In 2010, the agency struck an audit deal with Twitter, which had come into the agency's cross hairs after its employees' weak passwords led to a hacking incident. In 2011, the agency signed 20-year audit deals with Google and Facebook. In 2012, there was an agreement with MySpace. In 2013, there was one with Path. But there is little evidence that these agreements have led to a wholesale shift in how tech companies handle private data. While the F.T.C. deals might push the companies to be more careful about privacy changes, being careful is not the same as being private. It's possible - and seems likely - that agreements with the government serve mainly to add a veneer of legitimacy over whatever moves the companies planned to make anyway. It's true that both Google and Facebook have become more careful about privacy since their F.T.C. decrees. Both companies have told me they now run most major changes to their products through privacy experts, including lawyers. Before the agreements, the companies seemed to make changes more quickly. The attitude toward privacy at Facebook, especially, seemed to be to ask for forgiveness after overstepping users' concerns instead of asking for permission before doing so. Yet just because tech companies now think about the legalities of privacy does not mean their actions always improve users' privacy. For example, in 2012, after it had already signed the F.T.C. deal, Google altered its privacy policy to allow itself to merge data that it had collected about users from across its services. Before the change, information collected in one Google service, like Gmail, was kept more separate from information collected in other services. The change set off widespread concern among privacy advocates. But it presumably did not amount to any kind of violation under the company's agreement with the agency. And even when the agency does step in, it is not clear that its efforts really make much of a difference at tech companies. In 2012, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google was installing tracking cookies on iPhone users' web browsers, even though the iPhone blocked such code by default. Google denied any wrongdoing, but the agency's investigators found that the code violated the 2011 consent decree, and the agency imposed a ""record"" fine against Google. How much was that record-setting fine? $22.5 million. Note that in 2012, Google made a profit of $10.7 billion, most of it through advertising that was based in some way on data it collected from users. If you do the math, the agency's fine represented about 0 percent of Google's income that year. Could the agency's agreement with Snapchat have some deeper effect on the start-up? It's possible, because Snapchat's entire premise is privacy. The company claims that the fact that its messages are designed to disappear after people receive them leads to more carefree, authentic conversations on the service. I agree with that premise. As I've argued before, Snapchat's widespread popularity suggests that we are becoming more sophisticated about how we think about the digital trails that our phones generate. One possible outcome of the F.T.C. agreement is that Snapchat could renew its commitment to privacy. It could institute tougher data-security measures, and when it learns about possible vulnerabilities in its system, perhaps the company will move more quickly to address them. This would represent a change from recent behavior. Last year, after a security firm found that Snapchat's service allowed hackers to get hold of users' phone numbers, the company dithered in issuing a fix. Eventually millions of users' phone numbers were made public. ""I hope that what happens is that they change their technology to fit their promise,"" said Julia Horwitz, a lawyer at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a watchdog group that filed a complaint with the agency last year over Snapchat's privacy record. She added that her group was optimistic that the government's 20-year audit agreements with tech companies were beginning to improve how companies handle users' data. ""I think Facebook, for example, is kind of learning,"" Ms. Horwitz said. She pointed to Nearby Friends, a new, optional feature that lets users share their location information with friends. ""We were startled and pleased that it had a lot of pro-privacy features about it,"" she said. ""This looked like progress to us. And to the extent that being under a consent order influenced that, I think that Facebook is learning about the value of privacy."" Assessing the utility of these consent orders over all, Ms. Horwitz said: ""I think the answer is that this is a new tool, and for a new tool, it's starting to work very well,"" Ms. Horwitz said. ""Very well - really?"" I asked her. Ms. Horwitz paused, and then said, ""Sure.""  "
European Court Cites Privacy in Rejecting Data Law,"BRUSSELS -- A top court on Tuesday struck down a European Union law, adopted in response to deadly terrorist attacks, that required telecommunications companies to retain information about calls and emails for up to two years.  The European Union passed the legislation in 2006 after bombings on the mass transit systems in London and Madrid, with the goal of aiding security forces in tracking those suspected of terrorism and other serious crimes. The retained data typically indicates the people who were involved in a communication, where they were and how often they communicated, but it does not reveal the content of the conversations or messages. However, the law ''exceeded the limits'' of proportionality, according to the European Court of Justice, whose headquarters are in Luxembourg. Privacy advocates in Ireland and Austria had pressed their home governments to pursue the case, which gained urgency in light of disclosures in the last year of widespread electronic surveillance in Europe by the United States' National Security Agency. The court said that the law, known as the Data Retention Directive, ''interferes in a particularly serious manner with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data.'' Any law must not go beyond ''what is strictly necessary,'' the court said. Lawmakers at the European Parliament immediately called for a system that would do a better job of balancing privacy rights with the needs of security agencies. Legislation that addresses some of those issues is still slowly working its way through the body. Any new rules ''should in particular enshrine a high level of data protection -- which is all the more essential in the digital age -- thus avoiding disproportionate interferences with the private lives of citizens,'' Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, said on Tuesday. The proposed legislation, in the works since 2010 and introduced in 2012, would establish fines that could run to billions of euros and affect American technology giants like Amazon and eBay if they failed to adhere to rules limiting the sharing of personal data. Companies like Google and Facebook would also need to seek clearance from European officials before complying with warrants issued by United States courts seeking private data. In light of the court ruling, the European Commission, which is responsible for introducing legislation in the European Parliament, must now decide whether it needs to present new rules for how telecommunications companies retain data or whether the legislation now in the pipeline will be sufficient. The judgment ''brings clarity,'' Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union commissioner for home affairs, said in a statement. ''The European Commission will now carefully assess the verdict and its impacts'' and take its work forward ''in light of progress'' on the other digital-privacy legislation. Either way, the job of deciding how to proceed will fall to the next commission, which will be chosen after European parliamentary elections in May. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Imagine if Companies Had to Ask Before Using Your Data,"If you're worried about Internet companies using-and-abusing your data, you might want to consider moving to Europe, where privacy legislation is much further along than in the United States.  On Wednesday the European Parliament voted to approve legislation that would give people greater control over their personal information. Europe's privacy measure is a work in progress. It cannot become law until it has the approval of national governments, including those of Germany and Britain, which have been reluctant to take up the rules because they fear its impact on businesses. But the Parliament's vote is still important because it sets a high standard against which other proposals can be judged.While it would be naïve to think that the Parliament will get everything it voted for, there are lots of good ideas in the legislation it adopted that lawmakers everywhere, particularly in the United States Congress, should study carefully. For example, the law would do the following:   It would require companies to seek permission from individuals before collecting, analyzing and using personal data. Businesses will also have to explain their privacy policies in easy-to-understand language, and they will have to notify users of data breaches.   People would have a right to transfer their data to another service or business.   Users will be able to request that companies that have amassed information about them delete that data if there is no legitimate reason to keep it. This rule is designed with young people in mind; it could be used, for example, to let teenagers delete embarrassing photos on social media.   The rules would apply to all companies that collect data about people living in the 28 members of the European Union even if the businesses are not based in the E.U.   Companies will have to seek authorization from European authorities before providing personal data to another country, like the United States.   Businesses that break the rules could be fined up to 100 million euros or 5 percent of their global revenue, whichever is greater. Not surprisingly, many American Internet companies have lobbied against the European legislation, as have officials in the Obama administration. That is partly why European leaders such as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain have sought to delay any new privacy regulations until at least 2015. But one thing is clear: Europeans themselves are clearly in favor of tougher data protection rules. A survey published in 2011 by the European Commission found that 70 percent of people are worried about how companies are using their data and 75 percent want the right to delete personal information from websites.

"In the Future, Your Fridge Could Get Hacked","The next great advance in technology may well be the ""Internet of Things."" Simply put, many more devices and appliances that you use every day, like refrigerators, thermostats, garage doors and so on will be connected to the Internet, will adapt to your behavior and will be available to do your bidding even when you are not near them.  While the Internet of things could make our lives more convenient, two news stories this week suggest that it could also serve to compromise our privacy and make us more vulnerable to hacking. On Monday, Google announced it would pay $3.2 billion to buy Nest, which makes a programmable thermostat and smoke alarm that can be monitored and controlled through a smartphone. Some commenters are worried that Google would now know even more about us, like when we go to bed, wake up and leave the home - all things Nest devices track in order to reduce your heating and cooling bill. Nest executives have said they will not change the company's privacy policy, which restricts the use of data collected by its devices. But who's to say how long that pledge will last? Unfortunately, current laws provide inadequate protection against how companies collect and use the data they have about us, and the Internet of things could only make matters worse.Later in the week, a security company said that hackers had compromised an Internet-connected refrigerator and used it, along with more than 100,000 other devices including smart televisions, to send spam e-mail. Imagine the nightmare of dealing with a house full of appliances needing tech support, antivirus software and software updates. Personally, I am willing to give the Internet of things a chance - I recently ordered a Nest thermostat and smoke detector. But we should be under no illusion about these devices. They pose challenges to our privacy and security that will not be easily overcome.  "
White House Details Thinking on Cybersecurity Flaws,"WASHINGTON -- In a rare insight into the government's thinking on the use of cyberweapons, the White House on Monday published a series of questions it asks in deciding when to make public the discovery of major flaws in computer security or whether to keep them secret so that American intelligence agencies can use them to enable surveillance or an attack. The discussion came not in a presidential policy directive or a speech, like the kind President Obama gave when describing the criteria for conducting drone attacks, but in a blog post on the White House website. The item was posted by Michael Daniel, the White House cybersecurity coordinator, and appeared to be distilled from a far more detailed classified document giving guidance to the National Security Agency, the F.B.I. and others who often exploit flaws in Internet security.  Mr. Daniel repeated the N.S.A.'s declaration several weeks ago that ''we had no prior knowledge of the existence of Heartbleed,'' a security vulnerability that created widespread fears that passwords or other delicate information transmitted by millions of computer users may have been revealed. But he acknowledged that the Heartbleed incident had cast a light on a balancing test the White House has until now declined to discuss in any detail: When should the government reveal flaws that it discovers, and when should it use them for its still-unacknowledged ''stockpile'' of flaws that would help it penetrate foreign computer networks? It is a heated issue inside the N.S.A. and the Pentagon. The United States made use of four so-called zero-day vulnerabilities -- flaws that had been known for zero days to the outside world -- to attack and disable elements of Iran's nuclear program in an operation called Olympic Games. The United States and Israel, which mounted that campaign, have never acknowledged their involvement, and most of the time such vulnerabilities are exploited for more routine actions, especially the interception of email or other Internet traffic. But the intelligence agencies, along with the F.B.I., have argued that giving up a key weapon in that arsenal would amount to unilateral disarmament. The White House seems to agree. ''In the majority of cases, responsibly disclosing a newly discovered vulnerability is clearly in the national interest,'' Mr. Daniel wrote, because of the need to keep Internet transactions, on which the world economy heavily depends, as secure as possible. ''This has been and continues to be the case.'' But he spent the rest of his blog entry describing what conditions might lead to a decision not to publish the details of a flaw -- perhaps for a short time, perhaps for much longer. ''Disclosing a vulnerability can mean that we forego an opportunity to collect crucial intelligence that could thwart a terrorist attack, stop the theft of our nation's intellectual property, or even discover more dangerous vulnerabilities that are being used by hackers or other adversaries to exploit our networks,'' Mr. Daniel wrote, describing the review that has taken place at the White House in the past few months. ''This is an acknowledgment of the need to do offensive cyber, both espionage and attack,'' said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who served in the Bush administration and has written extensively on the legal rationales for the use of cyberweapons. ''What's notable is that the White House has now agreed that these issues have to be considered at a higher level, that often it's a hard call, and it's not an issue that should just be left to the N.S.A. or the F.B.I.'' Mr. Daniel wrote that the administration has now ''established a disciplined, rigorous and high-level decision-making process for vulnerability disclosure.'' He did not say who would participate, or whether the hardest questions would be bounced to the president, much as he sometimes reviews the details of drone strikes or other covert operations that could have diplomatic implications. Mr. Daniel did not say who runs that process, but administration officials say it is largely directed by the National Security Council, and often by Mr. Daniel himself. That group would weigh at least nine questions that Mr. Daniel enumerated. The first was: ''How much is the vulnerable system used in the core Internet infrastructure, in other critical infrastructure systems, in the U.S. economy, and/or in national security systems?'' That seemed to suggest that a vulnerability that had potentially wide impact on the American economy, its utilities or the cellphone networks, for example, would be more important than one with narrow implications. Another question for the group to consider, he wrote, was how much harm ''an adversary nation or criminal group'' could do with the vulnerability and whether it would be possible to know that such a nation or group was exploiting it. In the case of Heartbleed, the government was apparently unaware of the flaw, even though it had existed for roughly two years. Other questions turned to the issue of whether intelligence agencies think the information is necessary, for surveillance or an attack, and whether there are other ways to get it. Among the most interesting questions on the list was this one: ''Could we utilize the vulnerability for a short period of time before we disclose it?'' That suggests an option to allow the White House to split the difference between its intelligence needs and the principle of public disclosure. "
A Sneaky Path Into Target Customers' Wallets,"It was, in essence, a cybercriminal's dream. For months, an amorphous group of Eastern European hackers had been poking around the networks of major American retailers, searching for loose portals that would take them deep into corporate systems. In early November, before the holiday shopping season began, the hackers found what they had been looking for -- a wide path into Target and beyond. Entering through a digital gateway, the criminals discovered that Target's systems were astonishingly open -- lacking the virtual walls and motion detectors found in secure networks like many banks'. Without those safeguards, the thieves moved swiftly into the company's computer servers containing Target's customer data and to the crown jewel: the in-store systems where consumers swipe their credit and debit cards and enter their PINs. For weeks, the invasion went undetected; the malware installed by hackers escaped whatever antivirus protections Target had. Shoppers flooded Target stores over Thanksgiving weekend and into the following weeks of holiday deals, unwittingly sending millions of bits of their data into the corners of cyberspace controlled by a band of sophisticated thieves.  Target had no clue until the Secret Service alerted the company about two weeks before Christmas. Investigators who had been tracking these criminals overseas and monitoring suspicious credit activity spotted in December one common thread: charges and payments made at Target. At least one major bank noticed a similar pattern. On Dec. 12, JPMorgan Chase alerted some credit card companies that fraudulent charges were showing up on cards used at Target, people involved in the conversation said. An examination by The New York Times into the enormous data theft, including interviews with people knowledgeable about the investigation, cybersecurity and credit experts and consumers shows that Target's system was particularly vulnerable to attack. It was remarkably open, experts say, which enabled hackers to wander from system to system, scooping up batches of information. Investigators have been piecing together the timetable of the attack and continue to monitor the potential for additional fraud, especially since experts say that batches of stolen credit card data have yet to be dumped on the black market. The theft involved confidential credit and debit card data of as many as 40 million Target customers, and personal information, such as phone numbers and addresses, of as many as 70 million more. With Secret Service agents in Minneapolis investigating the extent of the fraud, Javelin Strategy & Research, a consulting firm, estimates the total damage to banks and retailers could exceed $18 billion. Consumers could be liable for more than $4 billion in uncovered losses and other costs. Investigators also say they believe that the invasive hack at Target was part of a broader campaign aimed at least half a dozen major retailers. So far, one other retailer, Neiman Marcus, has said that its system was breached at the in-store level, not through online shopping, and people with knowledge of the investigations have been reluctant to discuss whether the two are related. Investigators have seen some malicious software similar to that installed at Target in recent years, but they described the design of this malware on point-of-sale systems as particularly wily. The coding was written in a way that was adaptive and persistent. Grabbing Data Once installed, the hackers' malware snatched customers' data -- directly off the card's magnetic strips of credit and debit cards -- that is normally sent for processing to banks and credit card companies. The stolen data was then lifted and stored on an infected server inside Target, awaiting an order from the criminals. The coding was easily manipulated so that it could receive instructions from its handlers in real-time, changing at their command. Four miles from Target's headquarters in Minneapolis and more than a week before the public learned of the data breach, Patrycia Miller looked at the bill for the American Express account she and her husband used in their dog day care business. The usual charges appeared, including some from Target, where they shop a couple of times a week. But a few stood out -- a membership fee to Match.com and a $1,291.58 plane ticket on South African Airways from Lagos, Nigeria, to Johannesburg and Nairobi, Kenya. She asked her husband what he was up to. Puzzled, Mr. Miller assured her he had not signed up for an online dating service and had not booked an African flight -- ''Not for that price,'' he said. American Express swiftly credited their account and issued new cards. But it wasn't until Target confirmed the breach on Dec. 19 that the Millers learned what had happened. Gregg Steinhafel, Target's chief executive, declined to be interviewed for this article, and requests for interviews with other company officials involved in the theft investigation were denied. On Friday evening, Mr. Steinhafel released a statement, saying: ''When the breach was confirmed, I was devastated. I resolved in that moment to get to the bottom of it, and my top priority since then has been our guests. We've worked for 51 years to build a real relationship with them, and I am determined to do whatever it takes to secure their trust.'' Mr. Steinhafel said in an interview with CNBC earlier this week that he first learned of the data break-in when he received a phone call at home on Dec. 15, a Sunday morning, as he was drinking coffee with his wife. Secret Service and Justice Department officials had already met with Target employees a few days earlier to notify them of their suspicions. By then, credit and debit cards were showing up on the black market, and shoppers like the Millers were seeing unauthorized charges on their bills. It was not the first time criminals had managed to get inside a store's point-of-sale systems at their registers. Nearly a decade ago, Albert Gonzalez, one of the most prolific cybercriminals in American history, was stealing credit card data from T. J. Maxx and Marshalls clothing chains in much the same way. But recently, criminals' techniques have evolved. At the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a former official said there had been instances where criminals had managed to physically implant malicious code into point-of-sale systems on the factory floor. In most cases, however, criminals installed the malware remotely after breaking into an organization through other means. This time, the code the criminals instructed Target's registers to send customer data back to the infected Target server once every hour, on the hour, and to cover its own tracks. After siphoning the data back to the infected server, the malicious code immediately deleted the file where it had been stored, so there was no memory of it, according to iSight Partners, a security firm currently working with the Secret Service to investigate the attacks. The malware, known as a memory scraper, has been coined ''Kaptoxa'' after a word in its code -- Kaptoxa is Russian slang for ''potato'' and is often used by underground criminals to refer to credit cards. Its developers ensured the code would evade regular antivirus products -- even a month after Target's breach was made public most antivirus products still fail to catch it. To avoid setting off any alarms, the criminals waited six days after moving the data from the infected server to a web server that was itself infected with malware, and from there to a server in Russia that served as a proxy to mask the criminals' true whereabouts, according to Aviv Raff, the chief technology officer at Seculert, a security company headquartered in Israel that has been investigating the malware used on Target's systems. Within two weeks, criminals had taken 11 gigabytes worth of Target's customer data: less than the amount of memory on Apple's iPad Mini, but enough to contain 40 million payment card records, encrypted PINs and 70 million records containing Target customers' information. Shortly after, company executives flocked to headquarters and onto conference call lines to begin coordinating the response. The Search Begins Forensics experts were brought in from Verizon, led by Bryan Sartin, and from Mandiant, a computer security firm that responds to breaches, extortion attacks and economic espionage campaigns. (Mandiant has since announced it is being bought by FireEye.) They began digging through Target's firewall logs, web traffic logs and emails, looking for digital fingerprints and trying to determine how the criminals got in, what they took, and how to stop the bleeding. Investigators went about plugging Target's security holes, wiping malware from the company's point-of-sales systems and changing passwords. It was important to do everything at once. It is a process that Kevin Mandia, the founder of Mandiant, has described as akin to excising a malignancy: ''If you only remove the cancer in your leg, but you have it in your arm, you might as well have not had the operation in your leg,'' he said in an interview before the Target breach. Likewise, if Target missed one back door or one compromised password, the criminals could come right back in. Others in the company started planning just how, and when, to disclose the news to the public. Then, they set about trying to determine the impact of the breach, so they could notify affected customers, determine liability and get ahead of the news cycle. They wouldn't get so lucky. On the morning of Dec. 18, voice messages started popping up on Target's public affairs line from Brian Krebs, a prominent security blogger. Mr. Krebs, 41, who specializes in cybercrime, was asking about a big data breach. In underground criminal forums, criminals had been bragging that they had obtained a huge, very fresh batch of cards. And banks were dealing with a spike of fraudulent purchases. Mr. Krebs said in an interview that one contact at a large bank he would not name said he had visited one of the more reliable underground credit card sites -- a site called Rescator -- and bought a large batch of cards. The common point of purchase was Target, and all the purchases had been made between Thanksgiving and mid-December. After further investigation, Mr. Krebs began leaving messages with the company for comment. Officials say the company's plan was always to go public quickly. By the time Mr. Krebs's story was posted, a news release had already been written and the portion of Target's website devoted to the breach was already being built. The company decided not to immediately make a public comment or issue a news release. Instead, they waited until the website was ready and everyone who would be answering questions, either at call centers or for the media, would have the same answers on hand. A team of people worked all night to have the response ready. On Dec. 19, the team on the front lines of the response arrived at headquarters before the local Starbucks had opened. Before the sun was up, the release was sent out. A Deluge of Anger Customers jammed the company's website and phone lines and continue to be angered by the violation of their privacy. On Target's Facebook page, shoppers keep leaving furious messages. ''I am broke because someone used all my money to go on their shopping spree,'' Shannon Smith wrote. Another customer, Melissa Milligan Gunter, wrote: ''Dear Target, thanks for making me (and so many others) have to go through and change everything that I use my debit and credit cards for because you can't keep your customer's information private.'' Nearly 70 lawsuits have already been filed against Target, many of them seeking class-action status. Credit card companies and banks have replaced many customers' cards and accounts in the wake of the breach, but warn that people should still vigilantly scrutinize their statements and account charges. In Minneapolis, hundreds of Target employees -- from the legal, technology, finance and consumer and public relations departments -- continue to be involved in the company's response, working out of the 32nd floor of the corporate headquarters. Earlier this month, when a polar vortex plunged the city into temperatures below zero for several days, the company suspended its dress code, and senior executives gathered around the boardroom table to address the crisis in the sweatshirts of their college alma maters. Down the hall, packs of other employees colonized nearby rooms, rearranging movable desks and rolling chairs. Several television screens played multiple news networks. Surfaces were littered with extension cords, chargers, newspapers, cups of coffee and soda. Outside the corporation, attorneys general in several states are also investigating Target's data breach, along with federal authorities who would not comment publicly on the status of the investigation. But it appears that the hackers left a few clues behind that may aid investigators. One was a small word embedded in the code: Rescator. Despite the sophistication of the malware, this was, by several accounts, a rookie mistake. The name was left there when the criminals were debugging their code. It was the same name of the underground carding site, Rescator.la, where a bank official had first purchased a large number of cards before tipping off Mr. Krebs, he said. Mr. Krebs scoured the Web for clues to Rescator's identity. In a deleted comment from August 2011, he noted that Rescator introduced himself as ''Hel,'' one of the three founders of a defunct hacker forum called darklife.ws. Mr. Krebs posted some of the information he learned about aliases that may be related to Rescator, tracing one of them to Odessa, Ukraine. But investigators have not publicly pinpointed the location of the criminals' nerve center, suggesting instead that the hackers tend to move around, gather, disband and regroup. But they are monitoring the shadowy chat forums and other netherworlds where snippets of information about fake credit cards surfaces and is shared for sale on the black market, where the stolen data promises rich returns. ''We're expecting this to be a major contributor, if not the primary driver of card fraud for the next 12 months,'' said Alphonse R. Pascual, of Javelin Strategy & Research. ''Those cards will continue to have value for quite a while. These cards will still be available for purchase a year from now.'' "
Hackers Lurking in Vents and Soda Machines,"SAN FRANCISCO -- They came in through the Chinese takeout menu. Unable to breach the computer network at a big oil company, hackers infected with malware the online menu of a Chinese restaurant that was popular with employees. When the workers browsed the menu, they inadvertently downloaded code that gave the attackers a foothold in the business's vast computer network. Security experts summoned to fix the problem were not allowed to disclose the details of the breach, but the lesson from the incident was clear: Companies scrambling to seal up their systems from hackers and government snoops are having to look in the unlikeliest of places for vulnerabilities.  Hackers in the recent Target payment card breach gained access to the retailer's records through its heating and cooling system. In other cases, hackers have used printers, thermostats and videoconferencing equipment. Companies have always needed to be diligent in keeping ahead of hackers -- email and leaky employee devices are an old problem -- but the situation has grown increasingly complex and urgent as countless third parties are granted remote access to corporate systems. This access comes through software controlling all kinds of services a company needs: heating, ventilation and air-conditioning; billing, expense and human-resources management systems; graphics and data analytics functions; health insurance providers; and even vending machines. Break into one system, and you have a chance to break into them all. ''We constantly run into situations where outside service providers connected remotely have the keys to the castle,'' said Vincent Berk, chief executive of FlowTraq, a network security firm. Data on the percentage of cyberattacks that can be tied to a leaky third party is difficult to come by, in large part because victims' lawyers will find any reason not to disclose a breach. But a survey of more than 3,500 global I.T. and cybersecurity practitioners conducted by a security research firm, the Ponemon Institute, last year found that roughly a quarter -- 23 percent -- of breaches were attributable to third-party negligence. Security experts say that figure is low. Arabella Hallawell, vice president of strategy at Arbor Networks, a network security firm in Burlington, Mass., estimated that third-party suppliers were involved in some 70 percent of breaches her company reviewed. ''It's generally suppliers you would never suspect,'' Ms. Hallawell said. The breach through the Chinese menu -- known as a watering hole attack, the online equivalent of a predator lurking by a watering hole and pouncing on its thirsty prey -- was extreme. But security researchers say that in most cases, attackers hardly need to go to such lengths when the management software of all sorts of devices connects directly to corporate networks. Heating and cooling providers can now monitor and adjust office temperatures remotely, and vending machine suppliers can see when their clients are out of Diet Cokes and Cheetos. Those vendors often don't have the same security standards as their clients, but for business reasons they are allowed behind the firewall that protects a network. Security experts say vendors are tempting targets for hackers because they tend to run older systems, like Microsoft's Windows XP software. Also, security experts say these seemingly innocuous devices -- videoconference equipment, thermostats, vending machines and printers -- often are delivered with the security settings switched off by default. Once hackers have found a way in, the devices offer them a place to hide in plain sight. ''The beauty is no one is looking there,'' said George Kurtz, the chief executive of Crowdstrike, a security firm. ''So it's very easy for the adversary to hide in these places.'' Last year, security researchers found a way into Google's headquarters in Sydney, Australia, and Sydney's North Shore Private hospital -- and its ventilation, lighting, elevators and even video cameras -- through their building management vendor. More recently, the same researchers found they could breach the circuit breakers of one Sochi Olympic arena through its heating and cooling supplier. Fortunately, the researchers were merely testing for flaws that could have been exploited by real hackers. Billy Rios, director of threat intelligence at Qualys, a security firm, was one of those researchers. He said it was increasingly common for corporations to set up their networks sloppily, with their air-conditioning systems connected to the same network that leads to databases containing sensitive material like proprietary source code or customer credit cards. ''Your air-conditioning system should never talk to your H.R. database, but nobody ever talks about that for some reason,'' Mr. Rios said. The Ponemon survey last year found that in 28 percent of malicious attacks, respondents could not find the source of the breach. Ms. Hallawell compared the process of finding the source of a breach to ''finding a needle in a haystack.'' Ideally, security experts say, corporations should set up their networks so that access to sensitive data is sealed off from third-party systems and remotely monitored with advanced passwords and technology that can identify anomalous traffic -- like someone with access to an air-conditioning monitoring system trying to get into an employee database. But even then, companies require security personnel with experience in detecting such attacks. Even though Target used security technology supplied by FireEye, a company that sounds alerts when it identifies such anomalous activity, its I.T. personnel ignored the red flags, according to several people who confirmed the findings of a Bloomberg Businessweek investigation last month but could not speak publicly about Target's continuing internal investigation. Like all else, security experts say, it's simply a matter of priorities. One Arbor Networks study found that unlike banks, which spend up to 12 percent of their information technology budgets on security, retailers spend, on average, less than 5 percent of their budget on security. The bulk of that I.T. spending goes to customer marketing and data analytics. ''When you know you're the target and you don't know when, where or how an attack will take place, it's wartime all the time,'' Ms. Hallawell said. ''And most organizations aren't prepared for wartime.'' "
"China, a Fish Barrel for Cybercriminals","HONG KONG - In China, some of the most successful cyberthreats are frighteningly simple. One recent viral mobile message offered free Golden Retriever puppies to lure users into giving away personal information. Another online scam took thousands from a woman who wired money to an impostor she thought was her son's teacher. A current favorite of Chinese cybercriminals, according to Pei Zhiyong, the senior security researcher of the antivirus company Qihoo 360 Technology, is to simply program malicious code that asks users to disable their antivirus software.  ""It will say their security program is incompatible with whatever they're trying to do,"" he said. ""We call it a 'Candy Trojan Horse,' and 30 percent of users will actually respond by turning off their antivirus system."" Over the last decade, the Internet has gone mainstream in China. More than 600 million residents regularly go online, and China is also the world's largest smartphone market. And domestic companies like the Alibaba Group are among the largest Internet companies in the world. In its early days, China's Internet market was plagued by malware and viruses. Popular free antivirus software offered by many companies has since helped stem that problem, but has led to a new one: Many PC users have become so comfortable that they are now easy prey to attacks that involve simply tricking them, instead of having their accounts breached by complex software. At Chinese companies, experts say, awareness lags that of their counterparts in developed nations. In 2013, cybercrime cost Chinese companies and individuals $37 billion, according to a research report by the security firm Norton, putting the nation second behind the United States at $38 billion, and well ahead of the $13 billion that cybercrime cost Europe or the $1 billion for Russia. Security analysts offer many reasons for this, but top among them is the naïveté of China's myriad new Internet users, as well as government policies that have emphasized the growth of the Internet industry above all else. At the same time, many businesses have no consistent approach to ensure employees do not inadvertently compromise corporate networks. Companies also are often reluctant to pay for security software. And the prevalence of pirated software in the country - and the back doors and other security holes in those programs - makes many businesses, and individuals, unwittingly vulnerable. Beijing maintains strict control of the flow of information online and closely tracks many users. But it has focused far less on stopping cybercrime or punishing companies that enable or encourage attacks. As a result, China's companies tend to focus on attracting users above all else, and therefore a consensus among Chinese Internet companies on mitigating attacks has been slow to emerge. ""The Internet companies assume everyone is going to play dirty, so that's how they approach it,"" said Mark Natkin, managing director of China tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. ""The Dudley Do-Rights get chopped off at the knees, so instead of trying to clean things up, they get scrappy."" Things could get worse for China as new users take to the web on smartphones. According to the Norton report, 75 percent of Chinese smartphone users have experienced mobile cybercrime in the 12 months leading up to the 2013 survey, compared with a global average of just 38 percent. The high mobile cybercrime numbers are in part a result of government blocks on the Google Play app store, which offers applications for smartphones running the Android operating system. ""The ability to access Google Play is not there, so Chinese go to alternate app stores that don't have the security capabilities"" of Google's official app store, said Michael Sentonas, the global chief technology officer for Intel Security. A 2013 study by the Data Center of China's Internet showed that 35 percent of China's most popular 1,400 apps tracked user data that had no connection to the function of the application. When customers then bring their phones into work, the situation becomes dangerous for companies as well, Mr. Sentonas said. The huge cost of attacks on companies has led to growing awareness among executives, though analysts say many companies still lack a high-level executive charged with security. Efforts by companies to ensure that employees do not inadvertently compromise corporate networks have ranged from negligence to draconian measures, according to Thomas Parenty, the head of the information security firm Parenty Consulting. In one instance, Mr. Parenty recalled how a manager of a Shenzhen company set up employee computers so they all faced the front of the room. He then set up his desk on a raised dais at the back of the room, giving him a view of employees' screens so he could track online activity. ""It was like Oliver Twist,"" he said. At times, it is company policy, not employees, that leads to problems. Many Chinese companies have a tendency to spurn costly software, instead opting to use pirated copies of programs like Microsoft Windows and Adobe Photoshop, leaving them open to security holes in the software. There are many companies and organizations that use entirely unpaid-for copies of Windows, Mr. Parenty said. At one organization Mr. Parenty said he discovered that ""each employee computer's disk was entirely full of bootleg software and downloaded movies."" His firm ""had to strip each desktop to the bare metal and then buy legitimate software and put in controls so they couldn't just download pirated copies of everything Adobe has ever made,"" he said. To keep employees happy, he then set up a ""tea break computer"" not connected to the company's network, where workers could sign onto popular Chinese chat, gaming and social media programs. Recognizing that few companies will spend for security software, the most successful security firms in China offer software free. One of China's largest antivirus companies, Qihoo 360, provides a suite of antivirus programs without charge, making money on advertisements and other promotions it pipes through its products. The company had 495 million monthly active users for its PC-based products in September, according to the company's recent earnings report. Still, analysts argue it has more vulnerabilities than most purchased services and isn't ideal for protecting companies. There are signs that the government is doing more to clean things up. President Xi Jinping is chairman of a new group focused on the Internet that counts coordinating domestic Internet security policies among its goals, Mr. Natkin of Marbridge said. As proof that things are changing, he pointed to the announcement of the arrest of three men in the Beijing area in connection with the creation of malware targeting Apple devices. Still, he said the tendency for the government to be top-down in its policy-making could slow down progress.                       "
Automating Cybersecurity,"If only computers themselves were smart enough to fight off malevolent hackers. That is the premise of an ambitious two-year contest with a $2 million first prize, posed to the world's computer programmers by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, better known by its acronym, Darpa. It is the blue-sky, big-think organization within the Defense Department that created a precursor of the Internet in the late 1960s and more recently held a contest that spurred development of self-driving cars. Michael Walker, the Darpa cybersecurity program manager who is running the contest, imagines a future in which sensors on computer networks could detect intruders, identify the flaws that let them in, and automatically make the necessary repairs, all without a human computer expert lifting a finger. No such system exists today. The network security flaw called Heartbleed, for example, persisted for years in Web servers around the world before experts found it in April; hackers who knew about it could have used it to steal passwords and personal information. (Whether anyone did is unknown, but there were attacks after the bug was disclosed.) ''Not a single automation tool has stepped forward and said it could find that flaw unassisted,'' Mr. Walker said.  With numerous flaws in complex software, large data thefts have become commonplace. The credit card numbers of millions of Target shoppers were stolen last year. Last month, eBay told its users to change their passwords after its servers were breached. ''The problem is the fortification principle,'' Mr. Walker said. ''The cost for defenders of trying to block every possible weakness is so much greater than the cost of attackers, to be able to find one way in.'' The targets of the future will be even wider as networked computer processors show up in watches, thermostats, cars -- the so-called Internet of Things. Then the potential consequences will include not just stolen data and crashed computers but crashed cars in the real world. ''If we don't have a new security model,'' said Daniel Kaufman, the director of Darpa's Information Innovation Office and Mr. Walker's boss, ''we're kind of doomed.'' Mr. Kaufman said that perfect security was impossible, but that the goal was to make cyber security more like physical security. A determined thief can break into a locked, alarmed house, but cannot burglarize an entire neighborhood in one swoop. ''It's not like the bad guys are going to say, 'Well played, Darpa -- we give up,' '' he said. ''But if nothing else, we will have eliminated easy attacks and raised the cost to them of any attack.'' Darpa announced its Cyber Grand Challenge last fall. On Tuesday, it will release details that will allow programmers to start preparing the qualifying round, to be held a year from now. More than 35 teams have already signed up to compete. Seeking Collaboration The fundamental security imbalance is that human experts are too slow to spot and fix vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. The top experts, who tend to work for the government or financial companies, are often able to protect the most valuable and sensitive information. But vast stretches of the Internet are less carefully protected. And computers that might automate the task have limited sleuthing skills. Mr. Walker likened the situation to computers that play chess. It was in 1950 that Claude E. Shannon, the pioneering computer scientist, outlined what it would take to create a competitive chess program; that, Mr. Walker said, is about where automated cybersecurity stands now. Not until 1970 did the Association for Computing Machinery set up a chess tournament in which computers played each other. (Good human players were bored by such feeble opponents.) The competition spurred quick improvements as programmers collaborated with chess players, blending the expertise of both fields. Seven years later, a computer beat a player with a grandmaster rating. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion. Mr. Walker said he expected the cybersecurity challenge would bring together hackers with academic researchers, and the collaboration could similarly spur advances. ''We want to collide the two,'' he said. Darpa also has a history of successful grand challenges. In 2004, it offered a $1 million prize for a robotic vehicle that could drive itself 150 miles across the Mojave Desert in California. The most successful competitor drove just 7.3 miles. The following year, five cars finished the entire course. Many of the engineers who competed in the Darpa challenge now work at Google, developing self-driving cars that are driving on public roads today. 'A Petri Dish' The Cyber Grand Challenge is modeled roughly after ''capture the flag'' competitions at computer security conferences like Def Con, held each year in Las Vegas, in which teams are given software with deliberate flaws. They quickly analyze the software and figure out how to exploit the flaws to read hidden information on competitors' computers while devising defenses to fend off attacks from the other teams. (The Darpa team has hired programmers who had previously put together the Def Con competitions.) The hope is that such an elaborate analysis-and-defense system can be automated. ''Studying software sounds like it's something machines should be able to do,'' Mr. Walker said. But like chess, cybersecurity is far from simple. Pieces of such a system do exist. David Brumley, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and chief executive of the start-up ForAllSecure, led a team that developed a computer program that scans software for the Linux computer operating system. In 33,000 pieces of Linux software, it discovered 13,000 flaws that could cause the software to crash -- and it demonstrated the crashes. ''We actually generate a working exploit,'' Dr. Brumley said. ''That's the difficult part.'' In 152 cases, they showed that they could even take over the computer, turning it into a zombie to follow their commands. In the Cyber Grand Challenge, the competitors will each be given a suite of software programs with hidden, intentional security flaws that perform some tasks on a closed computer network, perhaps things like receiving and sending email, responding to information requests like a Web server. As the automated systems defend themselves, they must ensure that these workaday programs (called challenge binaries) continue to operate. Thus, the cybersecurity system acts like an airport checkpoint: It will earn points if it allows the challenge binaries to operate as designed -- the equivalent of letting harmless luggage pass through an X-ray machine -- while detecting and stopping attacks from competitors. The contest software and network will be incompatible with the Internet -- partly so none of the flaws and hacks accidentally escape and infect, but mainly to create a simplified, controlled environment in which the teams can come up with general strategies that can be widely applied. ''It's a petri dish for computer security,'' Mr. Walker said. A Lingering Friction Darpa is providing grants of $750,000 to each of seven teams, including one organized by Dr. Brumley, but the competition is open to any team. Dr. Brumley's team will consist of employees of ForAllSecure. While he has a system for finding and exploiting bugs, he lacks other parts of an automated system, like the ability to fix them. The top seven teams in the qualifying round will then each receive $750,000 to prepare for the finals, which will be held in 2016 in Las Vegas, at the same time and place as Def Con. The winning team will take home $2 million. The second-place finisher will win $1 million, and third place receives $750,000. Because Darpa events are free and open to the public while Def Con is a paid conference, the two events will be separate but adjoining. That represents a bit of a dÃ©tente between the government and the hacker world, whose relations have been particularly tense since Edward J. Snowden's revelations about the computer surveillance tactics of the National Security Agency. Last year, Jeff Moss, the founder of Def Con, wrote in a public message, ''I think it would be best for everyone involved if the feds call a 'time-out' and not attend Def Con this year.'' Mr. Moss said that this year there would not be a big welcome mat for government employees, ''but we're not going to say, 'You're disinvited' or 'Stay away.' '' Mr. Moss did not hold the N.S.A. spying revelations against Darpa. ''I think Darpa is a completely different animal,'' he said. The cybersecurity challenge will be an exciting match, Mr. Moss added. ''It's a glimpse into the future. These problems seem ripe for automation.'' Mr. Walker also said he wanted to broadcast the competitions over the web and to enlist game developers to come up with eye-catching visualizations showing the ebb and flow of battle between the computers. ''We also need sportscasters,'' he said, adding: '' 'Sportscaster' may not be the right word. Professional explainers.'' For the humans behind the computer competitors, it will be an odd change from the capture-the-flag competitions. Instead of several intense days pounding on keyboards, they will just set up their systems and then watch with everyone else. ''It's going to be nerve-racking,'' Dr. Brumley said. "
Heartbleed Internet Security Flaw Used In Attack,"Within 24 hours of the Heartbleed bug's disclosure last week, an attacker used it to break into a major corporation, security experts said Friday. Using Heartbleed, the name for a flaw in security that is used in a wide range of web servers and Internet-connected devices, the attacker was able to break into an employee's encrypted virtual private network, or so-called VPN, session.  From there, the hacker or hackers used the Heartbleed bug about 1,000 times until successfully extracting information like passwords to get broader access to the victim's network, said researchers at Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm.  The targeted company only noticed the attack in its later stages. When it began analyzing what happened, it realized the Heartbleed bug was used as the entry point, said Christopher Glyer, an investigator at Mandiant. The attack was one of the first confirmed cases of a hacker using Heartbleed. Until now, researchers say they have seen widespread scanning of the Internet for vulnerable servers, and in some cases people have taken material from those servers using Heartbleed. But it has been nearly impossible, they say, to discern between the activities of security researchers and hackers and there has been no evidence actual harm was done. Investigators were still assessing whether actual damage had been done and because of nondisclosure agreements, the firm has not named the targeted company - only that it is a ""major corporation"" with particularly sophisticated attack detection systems. ""The main takeaway is that within 24 hours of Heartbleed's publication, we're seeing this taken advantage of,"" Mr. Glyer said. ""And it's entirely likely lots of other companies are being affected and just don't know it yet."" On Tuesday, a 19-year-old man was arrested in Canada on charges that he had also used the Heartbleed flaw to steal taxpayer data from the Canada Revenue Agency. At the University of Michigan, computer scientists said the Heartbleed bug had been used 140 times to access their own stashes of data, which were put on the Internet as a test. They could not say whether the probes were the work of attackers, or other security researchers, but they did say that over half of the probes had originated in China. The University of Michigan researchers said earlier this week that there were still over 1 million web servers vulnerable. They are keeping an updated tally on their website. It was still unclear whether the Heartbleed bug was exploited before its discovery by a Google researcher earlier this month. For the last week, researchers at the Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a separate supercomputer facility, have been examining Internet traffic they recorded going in and out of their networks since the end of January, looking for Heartbleed exploitations before it became public on April 7. So far, they have found none.  "
European Firms Turn Privacy Into Sales Pitch,"Timo Laaksonen wants to look after your online data. As the head of cloud computing at F-Secure, a European online security company, Mr. Laaksonen has a simple sales pitch for F-Secure's cloud storage application. The company's product, which was introduced late last year, allows people to access their photos, documents and video files from anywhere in the world, much like services from the American companies Dropbox and Google, among others.  But unlike its United States rivals, F-Secure says it never shares an individual's data with other companies or governments. And, his company says, all of the information is stored in secure servers in Finland, which has some of the toughest privacy laws in the world. ""When it comes to cloud services, it's very much about trust,"" said Mr. Laaksonen, a 53-year-old Finn, who added that telecommunications companies like AT&T and BT of Britain now offered F-Secure's cloud service to their customers. ""As a Finnish security company, we can differentiate ourselves, particularly against U.S. companies,"" Mr. Laaksonen said. F-Secure is just one of many European cloud companies hoping to take advantage of people's growing appetite for online privacy. These European cloud operators have turned a particular focus on their local roots after the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about surveillance activities by American and British intelligence agencies. To lure customers, the companies are pointing out that their data centers are in the European Union, whose privacy laws are more stringent than those in the United States. Large companies like Deutsche Telekom, Germany's former state telephone monopoly, as well as smaller start-ups, are trying to win market share from American rivals like Amazon that dominate the global cloud market. National governments and the European Union are also providing financial incentives and long-term contracts to domestic cloud providers in a bid to jump-start an industry that remains a relative minnow compared with American whales like Google. In Germany, for example, that includes the creation of a ""Made in Germany"" label by local cloud computing companies to highlight domestic providers that comply with the country's data protection rules. The goal is to win more privacy-conscious German customers. ""We have to match the quality of American companies, but with the additional benefit of extra security,"" said Oliver Dehning, a co-founder of the German email cloud company AntiSpamEurope, whose three data centers are all based in the country. ""Being a German company is a major plus when talking to customers."" European cloud providers may promote their privacy pedigree, but they still have an uphill climb to challenge American tech giants. While Europe has been slow to embrace cloud services, American companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google have invested billions of dollars in cloud-based infrastructure like data centers and online software over the last five years. That investment, analysts say, will be difficult for European companies to match, particularly as spending by Europe's technology industry remains meager compared with its American counterpart. ""It's all about the money,"" said René Büst, a senior analyst at the technology consulting firm Crisp Research in Kassel, Germany. ""No European provider can compete with the likes of Amazon."" American companies also are responding to people's growing privacy fears. Many allow European customers to store online data in servers across the Continent, and companies like Microsoft now comply with Europe's data protection rules to win local contracts that would otherwise have gone to domestic competitors. And by often focusing solely on Europe, many European cloud companies have yet to reach the size of companies like Dropbox, which has almost 300 million users worldwide. In contrast, F-Secure, the Finnish online security company, says it has signed up just over one million customers for its rival product since its release in October. ""For European companies to be successful, they have to look to grow outside of Europe,"" said Gregor Petri, research director for cloud computing at the technology company Gartner in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. ""They need to become global."" Despite the difficulties, some of Europe's large telecommunications companies are trying to break into cloud computing. Over the last two years, Orange, the French telecommunications company, has noted a growing demand for cloud services from European companies looking to share data across their international operations. In response, Orange now offers cloud computing through a network of 30 data centers worldwide, including two in the United States. It also has checks in place so that companies can restrict where their data is stored to comply with specific domestic privacy rules. And since the revelations about the N.S.A. were reported last year, the company has received an increasing wave of questions about data security, according to Axel Haentjens, vice president of cloud computing at the Orange division that provides I.T. services to companies. In the face of this continuing concern about who has access to online data, Orange is now hoping it can make inroads against American competitors with global companies looking for cloud providers that are perceived to be more secure. ""The Snowden story has shifted the pendulum away from U.S. companies,"" Mr. Haentjens said. ""There's a lot of appetite from Europe to sign deals with European cloud providers."" While the rise of online privacy has played into the hands of Europe's cloud companies, some say that tougher data protection rules will not be enough to outmuscle the dominance of American companies. When Quentin Adam co-founded his cloud business, CleverCloud, in 2010, he was taking on Heroku, a division of the San Francisco tech company Salesforce.com. Mr. Adam and his 10-person team, based in Nantes in eastern France, offer data servers and online software to developers, and they have landed a number of large clients, including the French bank BNP Paribas. Though the company has roots in France, roughly 60 percent of CleverCloud's customers are based outside the country, and the United States is one of the company's largest markets. The company also is planning to open a data center in North America in the near future. For Mr. Adam, the goal has been not to rely on his local connections, but to compete with international players in creating the most reliable service for his customers. ""It has to be about the product. No one will use us just because we're European,"" Mr. Adam said. ""We have a French legacy, but we're becoming global.""                       "
Facebook Tries to Explain Its Privacy Settings but Advertising Still Rules,"A year after Facebook last changed its privacy policies, the company is proposing another round of changes to its rules.  This time, the focus is on explaining how the service works in simpler, clearer language, including a new animated dashboard that attempts to answer common questions like how to delete a post or who can see the comments you make on someone else's post. But as with previous moves by the company on privacy, there is an unstated business goal: to sell more advertising based on the vast quantities of personal data that the social network has on its 1.35 billion users, both from their activities on Facebook and increasingly, their wanderings on the web and inside other mobile applications.   In pursuit of that goal, every bit of personal information is a valuable data point that the company is eager to exploit, and Facebook plans to ask users in a much broader swath of the world to share details of their interests in order to better target the ads that are shown to them. Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy and a frequent critic of Facebook's privacy practices, said that the announcements follow the company's traditional pattern. ""They suffer from repeated 'we will do better privacy while we actually collect more of your data' syndrome,"" he wrote in an email. ""Facebook users need to be given actual control over its data-driven marketing system. Facebook's proposed new data use policy, unveiled on Thursday, does improve on the dense legalese common in most companies' privacy policies. It is organized by common questions such as ""What kinds of information do we collect?"" and ""How can I manage or delete information about me?"" The new policy, which won't be finalized for at least seven days while the company solicits comments from users, is also accompanied by a new feature called ""Privacy Basics."" Using simple animations, the  company tries to explain some of Facebook's complex privacy controls, including how to limit who sees your posts and how to block people who are bothering you on the service. ""The idea here is to give people more accessible information about how Facebook works,"" said Erin Egan, the company's chief privacy officer, in an interview. ""It's simpler, it's easier to read."" The explanations are, for the most part, helpful, continuing Facebook's recent attempts through tools like the privacy dinosaur to educate people about its many privacy settings.  However, the explanation of how the news feed works is misleading. Facebook suggests that if you like a company's page, you will see its posts in your feed. As every brand knows - and Facebook's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, recently admitted - most posts made by a company will never show up in the news feed of the average fan. Facebook's computer algorithms prioritize items posted by other people over those from brands, and companies generally have to buy an ad if they want to make themselves seen. But prompting more users to like more company pages does give Facebook more data to help it target ads.  Also noticeably absent from the new privacy explanations is the simple fact that Facebook users have very little control over how their information is used in advertising. The company asserts the right to use anything you do on Facebook to help it target ads to you, both on and off the service. Facebook even tracks what you do on other websites and will use that information for advertising, too, unless you explicitly opt out of the extra tracking - an option that requires a trip to a third-party website or soon, the tweak of a setting on your mobile phone. In Mr. Zuckerberg's view, advertising is valuable content, just like a baby photo posted by your best friend. So the new Privacy Basics tutorial encourages you to take advantage of Facebook's Ad Preferences tool, which allows you to tell the company what topics you are interested in so that you get more ads on those topics.  Ad preferences were first turned on in the United States in June, and the social network is now rolling them out to its users in the Britain, Ireland, Germany, France and Australia.  Brian Boland, a Facebook vice president overseeing the marketing of its ads products, said that American users who have tried setting their ad preferences have told the company that they ""feel more in control"" over the ads they see. Facebook also makes more money from ads that are better targeted and garner more likes or other interactions from the people who see them. Ms. Egan said the company's privacy tutorials were a work in progress, with 15 animated explanations now being posted and more to come. ""If you want to post a photo, we'll walk you through it,"" she said.                        "
"Americans Relatively Sanguine About Online Privacy, Study Says","OTTAWA - A survey released on Monday suggests that revelations about government online snooping provided by Edward Snowden did not raise concerns about online privacy to the same degree in the United States as in other countries. But it also indicates that a majority of Americans are worried about the security of personal information.  The online survey of 23,326 people in 24 countries conducted for Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian research group, also found that Americans view the Internet as less vital to their economic, social and political future than other people worldwide. While the poll found that the information leaked by Mr. Snowden about government online surveillance was well known in the United States, 62 percent of American respondents told Ipsos, a polling firm, that they were more concerned about online privacy now than they were a year ago. By comparison, that worry had increased for 83 percent of respondents in Brazil, India and Nigeria during the same period. People in Sweden were the most sanguine, with only 46 percent indicating that their privacy worries have increased. But Americans are nevertheless unhappy with the state of online security. Just 45 percent of American respondents said they thought that the government did ""a very good job of making sure the Internet in their country is safe and secure."" Tunisians were the most satisfied, with 82 percent agreeing with that statement while, at the other extreme, only 25 percent of Japanese respondents said that was the case. Similarly, only 31 percent of Americans agreed that ""private information on the Internet is very secure"". Their worries fit not unexpected patterns. The survey found that 76 percent of Americans are concerned about having their bank accounts hacked and 70 percent are worried about personal messages and photographs being accessed or stolen. But since the data release by Mr. Snowden, only 36 percent of Americans have done anything to improve their online privacy and security, a step taken by 69 percent of respondents from India. A minority of Americans said that they trust either the United States government, the technology industry, the United Nations or an international body of experts to run the Internet. And while the Internet was an American creation, Americans are comparatively a little less in its thrall than citizens of other nations. Seventy-seven percent of Americans agreed that affordable Internet access ""should be a basic human right."" By contrast, more than 90 percent or more of respondents from China, Tunisia, Nigeria, Indonesia and Egypt supported that sentiment. And just three quarters of Americans, 74 percent, agreed that the Internet was ""important for their own economic future and livelihood."" That idea was backed by 90 percent of Chinese respondents and 97 percent of Nigerians. The survey was released at a meeting in Ottawa about how the Internet should be governed, organized by the Canadian governance center and Britain's Royal Institute of International Affairs which is usually known as Chatham House.

European Privacy Debate on Display in Paris,"PARIS - Europe wants to cash in on its tough data protection rules. European Union policy makers are demanding greater controls over how companies like Google and Facebook use personal information. At the same time, others would like to use those same laws to help European companies compete against their American rivals as a way to jump-start a sluggish economy.  That debate over how best to leverage the regulations was on show during a meeting here on Monday, as local privacy regulators gathered to discuss the growing public outcry over how governments and tech giants gather and use people's data.  That outcry has resulted from disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about the activities of the American and British intelligence services, as well as the expanding use of people's information by Internet companies like Microsoft and Amazon. ''We feel we are losing control over our data,'' said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who heads the French data protection authority. ''Data protection is at a  crossroads, and it's important that Europe speaks with one voice.'' Europe is now completing a new round  of privacy rules, expected to be made final next year, that will give greater power to individuals over who has access to their data and how it is used. European policy makers are also considering fines of up to 5 percent of a company's annual revenue, or $125 million, whichever is greater, when the strict privacy rules are breached. While regulators are pressing ahead with even tougher data protection rules, some of Europe's lawmakers are eager to allow homegrown companies to use the rules governing the growing amount of personal information online  as a defense against the American tech giants that currently dominate the region's Internet economy. In Germany, for example, policy  makers and tech companies have created made-in-Germany email and cloud services - which allow people to store  information on the Internet instead of on their own hard drives - that comply with the country's tough data protection rules. And companies in Finland and France are pushing their own rival services, which are based on Europe's  stricter privacy rules, in the hope of enticing users to switch from American Internet giants to local competitors. ''Europe must turn data protection into a competitive advantage,'' Manuel  Valls, the French prime minister, said at the meeting here on Monday. ''It's  difficult to accept that European citizens have their data siphoned off by other countries without their knowledge.'' Critics warn, however, that Europe must also beef up its oversight of all  technology companies as they are increasingly scraping individual data for  commercial use. Currently, each of the European Union's 28 members has a separate data  protection authority that oversees the activities of companies in its jurisdiction. Campaigners say that these domestic regulators have yet to assess hefty fines on Internet companies for the potential abuse of people's online data, and that the system must be revamped to keep up with how companies, either European or those from outside the union, are using online information. ''The system we have now isn't working,'' said Max Schrems, an Austrian  lawyer who has brought a class-action lawsuit against Facebook that accuses the company of misusing personal data. ''If you park in the  wrong place, you get a parking ticket. But if a company violates the privacy rights of millions of people, nothing happens.''                       "
University of Maryland Computer Breach Exposes Records of Students and Staff,"The University of Maryland said on Wednesday that more than 300,000 records for students, faculty and staff were stolen in a sophisticated cyberattack. Hackers breached a university database containing names, Social Security numbers, birth dates and university identification numbers for faculty, staff, students and personnel who had been issued a university I.D. since 1998. The university said financial, academic, health and phone and address information were not taken.  Wallace D. Loh, the University of Maryland's president, said he was notified of the breach Tuesday night. ""I am truly sorry,"" Mr. Loh said in a statement. ""Computer and data security are a very high priority of our university."" By Wednesday, hackers had not taken credit for the attack. Typically, hackers seek such information because it can be used to steal identities, crack bank accounts or can be sold on the black market. Universities make ripe targets because they store vast numbers of personal records, often in decentralized servers. The records can be a gold mine because students, in particular, often have pristine credit reputations and do not monitor their account activity and credit scores as vigilantly as adults. Mr. Loh said the University of Maryland would be offering one year of free credit monitoring for those whose information was taken in the breach. Dozens of universities have been hit by breaches in recent years. In 2012, Harvard, Stanford, Cornell, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, the University of Rhode Island, the University of Arizona, Queens College and Marquette and 50 other universities were victims of attacks that exposed personal information. In the breach at Harvard, Stanford, Cornell, Princeton, Johns Hopkins and others in 2012, the hackers who took responsibility said they had done so because they were raising awareness for tuition increases in the United States and changing education laws in Europe, not by profit. But in a post to the anonymous website Pastebin, they said that in many cases, when they breached the servers at these universities, they found that somebody else had already been there. ""When we got there, we found that a lot of them have malware injected,"" the hackers wrote on Pastebin. In that case, IdentityFinder, a company that works to protect against identity theft following a breach, found that in many cases, the hackers had been inside universities' systems for at least four months unnoticed. At the University of Maryland, President Loh said the university had recently doubled its number of security engineers and analysts on staff and had doubled its investment in security tools. ""Universities are a focus in today's global assaults on I.T. systems,"" Mr. Loh said in the statement. ""Obviously, we need to do more and better, and we will.""  "
U.S. Denies Knowledge of a Bug on the Web,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration denied Friday that the National Security Agency or other parts of the federal government had known about the Heartbleed security vulnerability that has created widespread fears that passwords and other sensitive information belonging to millions of Internet users may have been revealed over the past two years. The White House was responding to a report by Bloomberg News citing two unidentified sources who said that the N.S.A. had known about the flaw and ''regularly used it to gather critical intelligence.'' Outside experts expressed strong doubts about the report, noting that the information that could be gleaned from the Heartbleed bug was somewhat random, meaning it probably would be a clumsy intelligence tool.  The suspicions about the N.S.A. were fueled by the fact that the agency regularly seeks out similar security flaws, and turns some of them into cyberweapons. But Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement: ''Reports that N.S.A. or any other part of the government were aware of the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability before April 2014 are wrong. The federal government was not aware of the recently identified vulnerability in OpenSSL'' -- the freely available encryption methodology -- ''until it was made public in a private sector cybersecurity report.'' The vulnerability was discovered by Finnish researchers and a researcher at Google. But, so far, there is no evidence that anyone used it to hack into personal or secret data. For days, government officials have said nothing about what they knew, or did not know, about Heartbleed. But as the Bloomberg report began to race around the Internet, the White House, the National Security Agency and the office of the director of national intelligence determined that they could not remain silent. Since the Heartbleed bug was first publicized on Monday, some security researchers and cryptographers have questioned whether the bug served as the basis for the National Security Agency's Bullrun program, its decade-long effort to crack or circumvent encryption on the web. But the Heartbleed bug was introduced in some code by a German programmer in March 2012, two years after the agency made a major encryption breakthrough under the Bullrun program, according to classified documents released by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden. Security researchers also note that the Heartbleed bug allows hackers to pull out data only in 64 kilobyte increments, making it less feasible that it would be used for wide-scale espionage. Initially, some security experts questioned whether it could be used to extract the private encryption keys to unscramble messages stored on a server in the past, or potentially in the future. But on Friday, a group of security experts at CloudFlare, the Silicon Valley Internet firm, said that in tests this week, they were not able to extract any private key data from a vulnerable server using the Heartbleed bug. ''Note that is not the same as saying it is impossible to use Heartbleed to get private keys,'' Nick Sullivan, a security engineer at CloudFlare, wrote in a company report. ''However, if it is possible, it is at minimum very hard.'' James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that the claim that the N.S.A. knew about the Heartbleed bug and stockpiled it for its own purposes was not in keeping with the agency's policy. ''In this case, it would be weird for the N.S.A. to let this one go if they thought there was such a widespread risk,'' he said. "
Federal Regulators Advise Banks to Protect Their Systems From Internet Security Flaw,"Federal regulators are advising banks to take steps to protect their systems from the Heartbleed Internet security flaw that could put sensitive customer information at risk. A group of regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said that banks should upgrade their systems to protect customer information.  Heartbleed is a flaw in a security measure used on many on-line banking and retail websites. This measure, called OpenSSL, encrypts data to keep it safe from intruders trying to steal confidential information such as bank routing or credit card numbers. In an unusual alert issued late Thursday, the regulators said banks should apply so-called patches to fix the problem and then ""strongly consider requiring"" users and administrators of their banking site to change their passwords. ""Financial institutions should operate with the assumption that encryption keys used on vulnerable servers are no longer viable for protecting sensitive information,'' the alert said. The regulators, acting as member of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, also warned that  Heartbleed could be exploited to infiltrate the banks themselves. ""Attackers could potentially impersonate bank services or users, steal login credentials, access sensitive email or gain access to internal networks."" The problem was first discovered by a team security experts and researchers last week and disclosed on Monday. By Tuesday, a number of large websites, including Yahoo, Facebook, Google and Amazon Web Services, said they were fixing the problem or had already fixed it. The banking regulators said the Heartbleed vulnerability has existed since Dec. 31, 2011. The alert by the banking regulators did not say whether Heartbleed breaches had occurred at any financial institutions.  "
"In Fight With Hackers, We Are on Our Own","Call it the hack whipsaw. A computer security company - it is rarely a government entity - comes out with a new report. Millions of stolen passwords. Tens of millions. No, hundreds of millions. The point is apparent: This is a big deal. Then it becomes clear this company is not simply informing the world out of some sort of noblesse oblige: It is trying to make money.  That Hold Security, the company that said on Tuesday it had discovered an enormous database of stolen records in the hands of Russian hackers, is trying to make money is clear. Hold Security now offers, for $120 per month, what it calls a Breach Notification Service, announced the same day the size and scope of the breach was reported. It is described as a real-time monitoring service that will alert companies if they come under attack, in addition to checking for vulnerabilities to the breach Hold Security uncovered. Hold Security is also offering an identity monitoring service for individuals. The site says the service will be free for 30 days. It is not clear if there will be a charge after that. If Hold Security discovers your email address in its database of stolen credentials, it says it will ask you to send encrypted versions of your password to compare against the database. Yes, it's certainly confusing - and off-putting. Does this mean you should ignore Hold Security's report, or the many other alarming reports that came before it? No. But you shouldn't have needed the latest scary evidence to be worried about your online security. The web, as Roger Rawlinson, a group managing director at NCC Group, which owns the security consulting firm iSEC, points out, was not built to secure information, it was built to share it. We're now trying to bolt on security after the fact, and hackers are outpacing those efforts. I have a personal perspective on this, since I was the victim of identity theft late last year. Someone opened several credit cards in my name at Best Buy, Fry's, Kohl's and Macy's. I originally assumed it was the result of the data theft at Target, which compromised about 70 million customer records. But a few weeks after I contacted the fraud departments of all four stores and filed a police report, I got a call from the small bank that issues cards for Fry's, First Electronic Bank in Utah. The security officer there told me there had been an arrest in my case, and that the identity theft ring that was using my personal information knew almost everything about me. So much, in fact, that it was able to answer so-called ""challenge questions"" about my credit history in order to open cards in my name. And once the identity theft nightmare starts, it is very hard to stop. Even after I reported the fraud to Macy's and sent them a copy of the police report I filed, they continued to bill me for months and even reported me to collections. At that point, a very angry phone call put an end to the problem. But I still get promotional email from all four companies because I am, after all, now in their databases. Could I have stopped the identity theft with better password security? Possibly. They found their way in somehow. It bears repeating: Be smarter about passwords. Make sure they're not easily guessed, and don't reuse passwords across any sites that contain important information. That way, if one is compromised (and it almost certainly will be at some point), it can't take down your entire digital identity. Set up multifactor authentication - that is, multiple steps like a password and a text sent to your smartphone - where it's available. It's worth the effort. Be careful about what data you give out online: Use fake birth dates and make up your mother's maiden name, if need be. Assume it's the Wild West out there. And be happily surprised when it is not.

Protecting Data Privacy at School and at Play,"Like many parents, Michelle Finneran Dennedy, who lives with her family in the Bay Area, likes to keep tabs on what her children and their friends are doing online. She intervened, for instance, when she overheard a conversation in the back of her car between her daughter and a friend about Instagram, the photo-sharing site. While Ms. Dennedy has told her daughter not to accept online friend or follower requests from strangers, the other girl, who frequently posted images of herself on Instagram, declared that she had more than 2,000 followers. Ms. Dennedy is particularly attuned to the risk that identity thieves or other online predators may obtain and exploit children's information because she is the chief privacy officer of McAfee, the computer security service owned by Intel. So she quickly contacted the girl's parents to offer her concerns and advice.  ""We have to look over each other's children's shoulders,"" Ms. Dennedy said. Parents trying to protect their child's privacy and data security online are grappling with two main concerns - information-sharing by children and data-mining by companies - only one of which they may have some meaningful control over. With the growing use of mobile devices and apps at home and in school, an increasing number of companies are compiling and analyzing details about children's online activities. Some sites that offer video games featuring cartoon characters, for instance, track children's activities around the web with the aim of tailoring advertisements to them. Some apps popular with children can collect information like their whereabouts or phone numbers. A federal law, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or Coppa, is designed to provide some online safeguards. It requires online operators to obtain a parent's consent before collecting personal details from a child under 13. Unfortunately for concerned parents, that law applies only to sites and apps specifically directed at young children - and not to general-audience sites frequented by adults and children. A recent article in The Wall Street Journal, for instance, reported that digital marketing companies are scouring, storing and analyzing the images people post on Instagram and Pinterest, another photo-sharing site, to help advertisers hone their pitches. ""I think parents should have a healthy skepticism about what their kids are doing with digital technologies,"" said Kathryn Montgomery, a communications professor at American University in Washington who studies children and digital culture. She recommended that parents read the privacy and security policies of apps and sites before letting their children use them. But data collection is so rampant, she added, that parents can do little to contain it: ""It's like asking what parents can do to protect their kids from global warming. It's out of their control in many ways."" According to a report last year by McAfee, children are embracing technology faster than their parents are able to help them navigate it. To help students, teachers and parents deal with the complicated issues that arise because of this, the security firm has teamed up with Discovery Education, one of the largest providers of digital content in schools, to offer a free online curriculum. The program is aimed at children ages 8 to 11; it is available at thinkbeforeyoulinkinschool.com. Using interactive scenes that children might encounter in real life, the program describes the specific kinds of information - like a home address or the name of a child's school - that strangers might seek from children online. It explains how cybercriminals can exploit such personal details to get access to a parent's bank accounts, install harmful software on their computer or ""send mean messages from your accounts."" And it gives children examples of how they should respond, such as by changing their privacy settings to block strangers from contacting them. ""We want to make sure this conversation is happening at every kitchen table and every classroom across the country,"" said Lori McFarling, the chief marketing officer of Discovery Education. But many parents are still working out their own privacy practices, said Ms. Dennedy, the McAfee executive, who was one of the developers of the new security curriculum for children. ""It's one thing to share that cute photo of your child in the bathtub with family members, but not with everyone on Facebook,"" Ms. Dennedy said. ""Are you using the right kinds of privacy settings?"" Even when parents take practical steps to limit the information they and their children publicly share online, they may not be aware of the magnitude of information that apps and websites can collect from children, said Jason I. Hong, an associate professor at the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. In a recent research project, he and his team studied the types of information collected by a number of animated game apps. Then they assigned each a privacy grade based on the kinds of data the app collected that a user might not have expected. Their ratings are available at www.privacygrade.org. The researchers reported, for instance, that Fruit Ninja, a free fruit-slicing game, collected information about a user's location, phone number and the phone's unique identification code, apparently for the purposes of tailoring ads to users. The app received a D grade in privacy. ""Personally, as a parent, I would not like my kid's location to be tracked, even by advertisers,"" said Dr. Hong. ""It's sort of a judgment call what your comfort level is with this."" The same holds true for apps and sites used in schools, he said. Parents might not mind, he said, if a math app collected information about the speed at which their child completed fraction problems. But they might mind if their child's school used insecure webcams or videoconferencing. Ms. Dennedy recommended that parents ask the chief technology officer at their children's school for a list of software programs used in the classroom as well as the specific kinds of information each collected from students. She also encouraged parents to ask what kind of security protocols were being used to secure students' personal information. ""Even if you are not a techie,"" Ms. Dennedy said, ""you should ask.""                       "
Stop Asking Me for My Email Address,"It's hard out there for a paranoid cybersecurity reporter. I've covered enough breaches, identity thefts, cybercrime andworse, to know it's a terrible idea to hand over my personal data - even something as seemingly innocuous as my birthday or email address - to a store clerk, or a strange login page on the Internet. But it's getting hard to resist. I was in the middle of buying a shirt recently when the sweet lady behind the boutique counter asked me for my email address. I explained, as I have a hundred times before, that I'm a paranoid security reporter who makes it a general rule of thumb not to hand out information unnecessarily.  ""We won't spam you or anything,"" she said, perplexed. ""We just need it for our database."" I knew then that the conversation was headed into a whole lot of awkward, as it had dozens of times before. The fact is, a boutique doesn't need my email address so I can buy a bathing suit. The hotel I stayed in recently didn't need my birth date, or my home address, or my driver's license number, before I could check in. And Target doesn't need to store your debit card PIN. After news of Target's breach first broke last month, a reader emailed complaining that after a recent purchase at a Target store in San Francisco, she was asked for her driver's license after her credit card was authorized. ""I gave it to her thinking she was only going to look at it, however she immediately scanned it through her register. I was a bit shocked and asked why she did that. She said it is always done but 'Don't worry, it is secure.'"" That, we now know, is absurd. There is a temptation to think that major retailers like Target are more secure because they have more cash to spend on security. It's the same assumption users made thinking Snapchat was secure because it magically makes selfies disappear, or that LinkedIn knew how to protect data because it likes to talk up big data, or that Adobe could protect our passwords.  Actually, I take that back: Compromised Adobe PDF files have been used in far too many cyberattacks to mention here. The point is that no company is secure. None of them. Not when they are up against an increasingly sophisticated, elusive enemy. But the problem is not just retailers, or technology companies or hackers, it's us. We regularly hand over data simply because we're politely asked. We don't read privacy policies, or ask companies whether our email addresses and passwords will be ""salted"" or ""hashed,"" encrypted with long or short keys, or whether those keys will be stored on separate systems from the ones they can unscramble. We don't challenge major credit card companies to hurry up and adopt smart-chip credit cards. And we don't stop doing business with companies that don't take data protection seriously. So we'll all feign shock that the Target breach did not just affect 40 million people as it previously reported, but well over one-third of America's adult population. And then, in a few days, we will likely go back to politely handing over our email addresses and birth dates.

Study Finds No Evidence of Heartbleed Attacks Before the Bug Was Exposed,"SAN FRANCISCO - Ever since the Heartbleed bug was exposed last week, the question everyone has been asking is: Did anyone exploit it before a Google researcher first discovered it? The worry is that in the two years since the bug was accidentally incorporated into OpenSSL - a crucial piece of free security software used by governments and companies including the F.B.I. and Google - attackers could have exploited Heartbleed to take sensitive information like passwords and the virtual keys used to decipher any scrambled information stored on a web server. What's more, they could have done so without leaving evidence detectable by the normal methods used to track who has gained access to a server.  But security researchers at the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which conducts unclassified scientific research, say that it is still possible to look for past Heartbleed exploitations by measuring the size of any messages sent to the vulnerable part of the OpenSSL code, called the Heartbeat, and the size of the information request that hits a server.  In an attack, the size of the response would be larger than the size of the request. And because the Heartbleed flaw can expose only a small amount of information at one time - 64 kilobytes - an attacker would probably have to use it repeatedly to collect valuable data, producing even longer responses. For the last week, researchers at the Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a separate supercomputer facility, have been examining Internet traffic they recorded going in and out of their networks since the end of January, looking for responses that would indicate a possible Heartbleed attack. They found none, said Vern Paxson, a network researcher at Berkeley Lab and associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. The research does not rule out the possibility that Heartbleed was exploited before January. Because the Heartbleed bug was first introduced in March 2012, would-be attackers would still have had 18 months to exploit the flaw. It also does not rule out the possibility that the bug was used in an attack beyond what Berkeley Lab and the National Energy research center monitor. The network traffic for both Berkeley Lab and the National Energy scientific computing center touch thousands of Internet systems and both facilities had maintained comprehensive logs going back a few months. Mr. Paxson said that if there were widespread scanning for the Heartbleed vulnerability, that would have been picked up by those important Internet hubs. Finding out if people have been taking advantage of the security flaw took on more urgency last Friday after Bloomberg News, citing two unnamed sources, reported that the National Security Agency knew about and had been exploiting the Heartbleed bug for the last two years. The N.S.A., the White House and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have all said the Bloomberg report is inaccurate and have denied knowing about the Heartbleed bug prior to its disclosure earlier this month. ""Reports that N.S.A. or any other part of the government were aware of the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability before April 2014 are wrong,"" a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Caitlin Hayden, said in a statement. But security researchers and law enforcement are growing concerned that hackers are trying to exploit the flaw now that it has been public for more than a week. On Tuesday, a 19-year-old man was arrested in Canada on charges that he had used the Heartbleed flawto steal taxpayer data from the Canada Revenue Agency. The agency reported on Monday that some 900 Canadian Social Security numbers had been compromised. Meanwhile, four computer scientists at the University of Michigan, Zakir Durumeric, David Adrian, Michael Bailey and J. Alex Halderman, have been monitoring stashes of fake data on the Internet - called honeypots - to see if hackers would try to retrieve them using the Heartbleed bug. It worked. To date, they've witnessed 41 unique groups scanning for and trying to exploit the Heartbleed bug on three honeypots they are maintaining. Of the 41, the majority of those groups - 59 percent - were in China. But the attacks began only after the Heartbleed bug was discovered on April 8. The computer scientists have also found no evidence of any attacks before the disclosure, and they say it's impossible to tell if the scans came from real hackers or other security researchers trying to look at the problem. And last week, CloudFlare, the Internet management company based in San Francisco, challenged programmers all over the world to steal the encryption keys off a vulnerable server using the Heartbleed bug. If an attacker was able to grab those keys, they could potentially decipher the encrypted contents stored on a server and unscramble future communications. It took 11 hours, but two researchers - one in Russia, the other in Finland - were able to do it. At last count, Monday afternoon, the computer scientists at the University of Michigan found that 1.4 million web servers remain vulnerable to a Heartbleed attack. They are posting lists of vulnerable web and mail servers on their website.  "
Security Flaw Emphasizes the Need to Change Passwords,"Wait a day or so. Then change the passwords on the web services you use. That is probably the best advice for web users unnerved by reports of a potential vulnerability for email and other online accounts because of the security flaw called Heartbleed.  Immediately changing passwords could feed a new password into a website that has not fixed the flaw, according to Mark Seiden, an independent computer security consultant. For websites, the fix-it process involves installing software patches on the computers in their data centers, then swapping out the confidential software key used to secure messages and transactions. The private key essentially shakes hands, digitally, with a public key. When they make an authenticated handshake - the signal of trust - the encrypted information is sent on its way. Swapping out the old private key for a new one is an extra step of caution, just in case the software flaw allowed cyberthieves to pilfer the private key. ""There's nothing users can do until the web services have made their sites secure,"" Mr. Seiden said. Users will largely need to depend on individual sites to notify them about whether the flaw has been addressed. Many major web services, like Yahoo, have already released such notices. The Heartbleed scare, even if it doesn't turn out to hurt many consumers, is a reminder of the importance of password hygiene. Changing passwords occasionally is a good idea, as is using a different password for each site. If passwords are lost because of a security breach at a company, identity thieves have a far greater opportunity for mischief. To vary passwords, Mr. Seiden suggests choosing a formula that is a variation on a theme. Pick out a core password of a mixture of six letters and numbers that are not a word. Then, your passwords become variations on that core, which is reused. For example, Mr. Seiden said, you pick the second and third letter of a service, to avoid being obvious. If the service is Yahoo, the letters are ""a"" and ""h."" Those are added at the front or back of your core password, or one letter at the front and the other at the back. Next time, perhaps, you choose the letter below those two on a computer keyboard. ""This is a good time to review your password practices in general,"" Mr. Seiden said. ""Any kind of formula can help. It's what I use.""  "
Embracing HTTPS,"In light of a growing number of cyber security and data privacy concerns, replacing HTTP with its secure alternative, HTTPS, is becoming increasingly important. Although HTTPS has been around for 20 years, many websites have traditionally served traffic over an insecure HTTP channel. In the early days of the web, server and network performance were often limiting factors as to whether a site used HTTPS. The server had to have enough horsepower to handle the encryption and decryption of the data, and the network had to be able to handle the extra activity. Many of these performance concerns have become obsolete - the cost of adoption is now low enough that we should start looking into using HTTPS everywhere.   Benefits of HTTPS   1. Authenticity of News Delivery    2. Privacy    3. Security    4. Improved Ranking in Search Engines    5. Better Analytics    6. Better User Experience    7. Third-Party Integrations    8. Using Emerging Technologies     9. Related Improvements    The Challenges  To successfully move to HTTPS, all requests to page assets need to be made over a secure channel. It's a daunting challenge, and there are a lot of moving parts. We have to consider resources that are currently being loaded from insecure domains - everything from JavaScript to advertisement assets.  If the assets for an advertisement aren't able to serve over an HTTPS channel, the advertisement will probably not display on the page, directly affecting revenue. It can be difficult  to determine if each advertisement will load over HTTPS. Considering the importance of advertisements, this is very likely to be a significant hurdle to many media organizations' implementation of HTTPS. While some advertising platforms, including Google's DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP), do support HTTPS loading, there are still a number of ad networks that may not be HTTPS-compatible.  Aside from advertising, organizations may face other hurdles while implementing HTTPS. Support for modern solutions, such as HSTS, are worth consideration.   A Call to Action  If you run a news site, or any site at all, we'd like to issue a friendly challenge to you. Make a commitment to have your site fully on HTTPS by the end of 2015 and pledge your support with the hashtag #https2015.

Home Depot Says Hackers Also Stole Email Addresses,"The hackers that broke into Home Depot's computer network this year took 53 million customer email addresses in addition to the payment card details for millions of customers, the company announced on Thursday.  When the company first confirmed in September that its computer systems had been breached, it said someone had gained access to credit card information and other personal data for 56 million of its customers - the largest known breach of a retailer. The email addresses could be used in phishing attacks, in which hackers send malicious links or attachments or try to trick people into giving them more valuable information, like passwords. The company also settled another mystery. Until now, it was not publicly known how hackers had managed to get into its systems. But on Thursday, Home Depot said someone used the user name and password of one of its vendors to gain a foothold, then broke into different parts of Home Depot's systems, including a database of customer emails and the company's in-store cash register systems. The company did not say which of its vendors the hackers used to gain access. According to a government report from July, hackers have been looking for new ways to gain entry into the computer networks of American retailers. One way is through vendors that have access to the network the hackers want to penetrate.  In the breach at Target last year, for example, hackers managed to break in through the retailer's heating and cooling management company. In other cases, hackers have broken in through a range of third-party systems, from those to manage human resources to employees' favorite Chinese restaurants. Until the Target breach was exposed in December, former Home Depot employees say, Home Depot did not take an aggressive approach to data security, relying on outdated software and ignoring warnings from employees. But the company said the malware that was used to steal data from its systems had never been used before the breach and would have been difficult for its antivirus systems to detect. Home Depot said it had since plugged holes in its systems and would alert customers whose email addresses were compromised. After the Target breach, the company also began adding tough encryption of payment data in its United States store, in which hackers would acquire only acquire indecipherable gibberish in place of card information. Home Depot said encryption was completed in its United States stores on Sept. 13 and would be finished in its Canadian stores early next year. Home Depot also said it would start providing chip-and-PIN technology, which uses a microchip and a personal code to make it more difficult for hackers to use the payment details collected from one merchant for any future attacks or to counterfeit credit cards.  The payment card industry has set a soft deadline of October 2015 for United States merchants to switch to chip-and-PIN technology. Home Depot has said its project will be completed before then. "
Q&A on Heartbleed: A Flaw Missed by the Masses,"This week, security researchers publicized a significant security flaw, named Heartbleed, which could expose the sensitive information that people plug into websites, like passwords and credit card numbers. Unlike some past Internet security problems, the solution isn't as simple as immediately changing a password. And the cause of the security flaw remains confusing to many everyday Internet users. In an interview, Zulfikar Ramzan, the chief technology officer for Elastica, a cloud security startup, offered some insight into Heartbleed and open-source software, and gave suggestions for what consumers should do. Below is an edited transcript of the interview.   Q.   What is Heartbleed?   A.   Basically when you make a transaction online today, whether it's a bank or credit card company, part of what ensures security is a protocol called SSL. It's just a way to encrypt the data so that nobody can read it when it's being transmitted from you to the bank or another company. What Heartbleed is is a way that an attacker can steal bits of information about that transaction - things you thought were being safeguarded. The attacker can start reading sensitive data about a transaction and learn things like your passwords and credit card numbers that you thought were kept confidential.  Q.   How did this happen?   A.   What happened was, two years ago there was a programming flaw put into this thing called OpenSSL, an open-source implementation of the SSL protocol. A lot of websites use OpenSSL to achieve security. What happened in these cases is that these programs are very complicated, and when things are very complex, some flaws can be missed. It may have been there all along, but it was just hidden in plain sight from the perspective of everybody else.  Q.   What is open source?   A.   It's a movement in many ways. Let's say someone wants to build a program to do something. They might invite other people to start contributing to that software - it's a method where you can build software programs together with a community of people. You make the software free and easily available to other people if they want to use it. Because so many people are working on the software, that makes it so it's less susceptible to problems. For security it's more important in many ways, because often security is really hard to implement correctly. By having an open source movement around cryptography and SSL, people were able to ensure a lot of basic errors wouldn't creep up into the products. OpenSSL is an open source project that's been around for many years. The code has been developed by many people for many years. Any piece of software is susceptible to vulnerability. I think on the whole it's still better to use something that's been vetted by many people for many years. Ultimately the more people who look at it, the more people will find security problems quickly.  Q.   So how could the flaw not get noticed for two years?   A.   It's amazing - when I looked at the flaw myself I said, ""Obviously, this is a pretty simple error."" This comes down to the issue that there's so much code out there right now, and there's so much code people are writing. There was a particular protocol called Heartbeat that did not get as much scrutiny. The Heartbeat protocol is a sub-part of SSL. Heartbeat is meant to ensure communications are kept alive. So when two people are communicating and there hasn't been any communication for a while, it keeps the communication line alive for a bit - it keeps a session alive so it doesn't get taken down. What would typically happen in SSL is the communication would get terminated immediately. Heartbeat is not the main part of SSL. It's just one additional feature within SSL. And as an additional feature, it may not get as much scrutiny as the main part itself. So it's conceivable that nobody looked at that code as carefully because it was not part of the main line.  Q.   What are the other encryption options comparable to SSL, and why aren't they used more widely?   A.   SSL has been around for quite a while - since the mid-90s. It has evolved over time and has become a de facto standard. I think in the early days of the Internet, once something got a certain amount of adoption it took a life of its own. It would be really difficult to come up with a new standard of this point. SSL is the underlying protocol, and OpenSSL is one implementation of the SSL protocol. They've found little issues of it here and there, but there has been no major flaw in how SSL works. I think despite this flaw it is still the best implementation out there. There are going to be some issues with it, but at least the likelihood of an issue with OpenSSL as a whole might be less than another library that might not have been looked at as much.  Q.   What should everyone do?   A.   There are two things I recommend. There are some sites where you can check if the websites have been upgraded to patch the problem. First check your site to make sure it's been patched. If it has been patched, then go ahead and log in and change your password. If you change your password and the site hasn't been patched, then you're giving a hacker a new password.  Q.   What about credit card numbers and other sensitive information you might have entered online?   A.   That's a good point: Any data that you sent - whatever you've typed into a computer that's gone to somewhere else - is at risk, like your social security, bank account and credit card numbers. The hacker could have gained access to anything. But I'd say that the first line would be start with your password and work your way backwards from there. Start monitoring credit card statements, and if you see suspicious activity, call the bank.  "
Hack of Community Health Systems Affects 4.5 Million Patients,"Community Health Systems, a publicly traded hospital operator based in Franklin, Tenn., said that personal data, including names, Social Security numbers and addresses, for 4.5 million patients had been compromised in a Chinese cyberattack on its systems from April to June.  The company, which operates 206 hospitals in 29 states, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday that that the attackers had bypassed its security systems and stolen data that also included birth dates and telephone numbers for the patients, who had been referred to or treated by doctors affiliated with the company over the last five years. The company is required to notify affected patients and agencies under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which protects such personal data. Community Health Systems engaged Mandiant, a subsidiary of FireEye, the Milpitas, Calif. computer security company, to conduct forensics on the attack. Mandiant said it believed the attackers were part of an advanced group based in China that typically steals valuable intellectual property, such as medical device and equipment development data. Instead, the criminals took nonmedical data. The hospital operator noted that no patient credit-card, medical or clinical information had been taken. The company confirmed the hack in July and said it had eradicated the attackers' malware from its systems and increased its computer defenses to prevent future attacks. The company said it would be providing identity theft protection to affected patients and carried cyber insurance to mitigate some of its losses. Security experts have long predicted that the digitization of medical records would invite hackers. Last year, Stephen Cobb, a senior researcher at ESET, the antivirus company, calculated that 24,800 Americans had protected health information exposed - per day - in 2013, based on the number of breaches disclosed on the website of the Health and Human Services Department last year. Including the breach at Community Health Systems, six million Americans have had personally identifiable data compromised in 2014, according to the agency's website, which only lists breaches that have affected more than 500 patients.                       "
When Start-Ups Don't Lock the Doors,"Young tech companies have a long list of to-dos. Signing up users and raising money are usually at the top of the list. Much further down? Data security. That neglect has recently come back to bite many hot new applications and web services -- and their users -- and has them rushing to improve their products after breaches and holes were discovered. Tinder, the popular dating app, last month acknowledged flaws in its software that would let hackers pinpoint the exact locations of people using the service. Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, also said last month that hackers had gained access to customer data, including passwords and phone numbers. And only days after the messaging service WhatsApp was sold to Facebook for up to $19 billion two weeks ago, security researchers pointed out that -- despite the company's claims to the contrary -- WhatsApp had lax encryption and protection of personal information for its more than 400 million users.  ''There's so much focus on acquiring customers and delivering products and services that security is not top of mind,'' said Tripp Jones, a partner at August Capital, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm. Half-joking, he added: ''For many companies, a security breach would almost be a nice problem to have in some cases. It means you have enough customers for someone to care.'' Many of the companies, including Kickstarter and Tinder, have rushed to improve their overall security after they were breached. Snapchat, the ephemeral messaging service that repeatedly ignored warnings about a data breach that exposed millions of user names and phone numbers, eventually acknowledged the loophole and hired Peter Magnusson, a head of engineering at Google, to help improve the company's security efforts. Even so, as Snapchat has gained more users, it has also lured spammers, who have taken to sending malicious ads and links using the service. Jay Nancarrow, a Facebook spokesman, said one of the first things Facebook planned to do after the WhatsApp deal closed was conduct an intense security audit of WhatsApp and its messaging service. ''We always perform a thorough security audit and share security resources when we acquire a company,'' Mr. Nancarrow said. ''Security is always a top priority for us.'' While bigger and more established tech companies like Facebook generally have teams dedicated to security, they are not impervious to vulnerabilities. And they still have the biggest targets on their chests. In late February, for example, Apple acknowledged a bug in its operating system that could let hackers tap into information in emails and other communications that were meant to be encrypted. Still, when a new mobile service takes off, it is usually far more vulnerable. Before a major breach or hole is discovered, analysts say, tech entrepreneurs take possible security risks as an accepted trade-off for building their product at a rapid pace. Stricter password requirements and airtight encryption take a back seat to user growth, convenience and feature introductions. And in many ways, mobile apps and services -- which have been taking off most rapidly lately -- face security challenges different from those of technology built for their desktop predecessors. The information at risk on mobile devices is often more personal than on desktop devices, because mobile devices now include things like digital wallet apps, location-tracking recommendation services, and photo-messaging apps. Government officials say the amount of data flowing through some young companies' networks rivals what the government itself can collect. The danger, some officials note, is that government agencies have no jurisdiction to protect it, or even the ability to share classified threat information with the companies, leaving the onus to protect personal data from cybercriminals and nation-states upon the companies themselves. Aaron Grattafiori, a security researcher at iSEC Partners, a security firm, said start-ups could not always anticipate their potential security holes. ''There's a lot more user information on a phone than there used to be,'' he said. ''Often start-ups can be in over their heads before they know it.'' And start-ups are asking for increasingly personal information. ThirdLove, a lingerie company, uses a mobile application to gauge a woman's bra size using an iPhone camera. After signing up, users take a photograph of their torso in a fitted tank top and send it to the company, which uses virtual sizing algorithms to determine their bra size. The company says it has gone through extensive security audits to protect sensitive information, and claims to use top-level encryption, said Heidi Zak, a founder of the company. ''No one ever accesses those photos,'' she said. ''Most women are in a tank top and their heads are cut off.'' Ms. Zak declined to say how many customers the service had, but said that 85 percent of the customers had used the free sizing software. Some entrepreneurs say they are making security a priority from the start of their venture. As breaches become more commonplace, top-notch security can be a powerful marketing tool. After Snapchat was breached, for example, Wickr, a competitive service that uses secure encryption and does not store customer information on its servers, experienced a 50 percent bump in user sign-ups. It saw a 600 percent jump last week after security researchers began to question the security of WhatsApp. Among those who migrated to Wickr from WhatsApp was Amit Yoran, former cybersecurity czar at the Department of Homeland Security, who said he switched because of the lack of transparency around WhatsApp's security and privacy policies. ''From the moment we started building Wickr, we assumed we'd be attacked by the most advanced nation-states in the world,'' said the Wickr co-founder Nico Sell. ''Nowadays, I think every company needs to make that assumption.'' To that end, Wickr will announce this week that it plans to license its encryption software to apps like Snapchat or WhatsApp as part of its business model, rather than profit off user data. That pledge has gone over well with security- and privacy-minded investors. Wickr just raised over $9 million from Thor Halvorssen, president of the Human Rights Foundation; Gilman Louie, former head of the C.I.A.'s venture arm, In-Q-Tel; Juniper, a networking company; Richard A. Clarke, the former counterterrorism czar; and others. But all too often, security researchers and analysts say founders' approach to security is still simply to pray they their company is not hacked, and to ask for forgiveness if it is. Robert Hansen, the director of product management at WhiteHat Security, a website security company, said persuading start-ups to invest in security could often feel like ''talking to a brick wall.'' ''Most don't get it, and the ones who do don't want to get it,'' Mr. Hansen said. ''It's all about opportunity cost. For every dollar they spend on better security, they think they're abandoning a new feature that can get them featured on Gawker.'' But start-ups who have not prioritized data security have learned the hard way that breaches can also lead to publicity -- only of an undesirable sort. Ashvin Kumar, the chief executive of Tophatter, a mobile live-auction site, recalled a disastrous hack that tarnished the reputation of one of his previous companies, Blippy, which let people publish their credit card transactions online. The service, which was introduced in 2010, first garnered positive attention from venture capitalists and early adopters before users realized that some credit card details were being indexed by Google and appearing in search results. Mr. Kumar described the episode as a ''freak occurrence'' but also acknowledged a bit of neglect and oversight when it came to protecting his users. ''We didn't foresee that certain aspects of the information we were storing had personally identifiable information in it,'' he said. He said that most entrepreneurs understood the gravity of security missteps. ''Everyone would acknowledge that one misstep and you're toast,'' he said. ''It's a really, really serious issue.'' Even so, he said, it is easy to let that lapse while founders get a new product up and running. ''If all day you worry about the security,'' he said, ''you don't have a product.'' "
Europe Takes Step Toward Laws Protecting Privacy,"BRUSSELS -- The European Parliament passed a strong new set of data protection measures on Wednesday prompted in part by the disclosure of America's vast electronic spying program. But the prospects for the provisions to become law will depend on the 28 European Union member governments giving their accord, which is highly uncertain. And the current Parliament will disband for elections in May, meaning the package will have to be picked up and carried forward by a new set of lawmakers who may or may not be as concerned about digital privacy as the current body. The measures, meant to protect the European Union's 250 million Internet users from online surveillance, approved by a wide margin by lawmakers meeting in Strasbourg, France, had been under discussion since 2012. But they received impetus last year by revelations from Edward J. Snowden, a former contractor at the United States National Security Agency, about the spying programs carried out by the N.S.A. and other intelligence agencies, including in Europe.  The new rules, among the most stringent data protections that lawmakers anywhere have pursued, aim to give people more say about who gets access to their personal data and would increase safeguards on the data that ends up with the police and judicial authorities. They would also grant individuals the right to have their online data erased -- the so-called ''right to be forgotten.'' The provisions are meant to replace the hodgepodge of privacy rules across the 28 European Union member states with a single body of law, giving businesses and citizens greater certainty about their rights and responsibilities. To protect citizens against online surveillance of the type Mr. Snowden has revealed, search engines, social network and cloud storage companies would be required to receive permission from the data protection authorities in a citizen's home country before turning over any of his data to another country. The company would also have to tell the person about the third-country request. A company that willfully violated the privacy provisions would be subject to stiff fines. Big Internet companies like Facebook, Google or Apple could potentially face fines of up to 100 million euros, or $140 million, or 5 percent of their global turnover, up to a maximum of 100 million euros. European and American companies had strongly opposed the legislation. ''I think Parliament has given a very clear signal today about how we see data protection, civil rights and the rule of law,'' said Sophia in 't Veld, vice chairwoman of the body's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. The legislation calls for ''more investment in data security, for Europe to become less dependent on American Internet giants,'' she said. In the European Union system, the Parliament's version of the law would need to be reconciled with the 28 member states represented on the European Council. But those member states -- particularly Germany, Britain and France, all of which have major spying programs of their own -- have shown scant interest in changing the rules. The draft measures aim to give Europeans an overarching set of privacy protections, in contrast to the United States, where privacy laws differ from sector to sector -- for financial data and medical data protection, for instance -- and notification requirements vary from state to state. The European measures would also give governing bodies the right to impose fines in cases where a company violated privacy provisions, unlike in the United States where the Federal Trade Commission is empowered to impose fines only in cases where companies were found to have misled consumers about their data collection practices -- not because of any federal data protection law. Some privacy lawyers in the United States questioned whether the European spying resolution would prevent companies from handing European data over to foreign governments. Miriam Wugmeister, a privacy lawyer at Morrison Foerster, noted that European Union member state laws contain exceptions for compliance. ''If the public sector has a legitimate reason to obtain the data, then the companies have to provide it to them,'' she said. The draft law governing personal data passed the European Parliament by a margin of 621-10, with 22 abstentions. A separate, non-binding resolution that condemned the U.S. spying and called for Europe to respect ''democratic, judicial and parliamentary safeguards and oversight in a digital society,'' passed 544-78, with 60 abstentions. That resolution received less support than the data protection law because many legislators, particularly on the right, argued that such an investigation lay beyond the purview of the Parliament. Although the next Parliament will not be bound by the rules adopted Wednesday, Ms. in 't Veld said she was optimistic that there would be support in the incoming body. ''The new Parliament will probably be full of euroskeptics, homophobes and racists,'' she said. ''For everything else it will be a disaster, but this is probably one point where we'll find common ground.'' Dirk De Backer, a spokesman for the European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, did not respond to a request for comment. Viviane Reding, the European Union justice minister, who pushed for revisign the European Union privacy rules, said in a statement that the new rules ''will make life easier for business and strengthen the protection of our citizens.'' ''Strong data protection rules must be Europe's trademark,'' Ms. Reding added. ''Following the U.S. data spying scandals, data protection is more than ever a competitive advantage.'' Ms. in 't Veld acknowledged that, in the end, member state governments could choose not to take further action, ''but they will have to explain it to their citizens,'' she said. ''We are the only Parliament that has taken this up. Somebody, somebody has to speak out.'' Nicole Perlroth contributed reporting from San Francisco. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"E.U. Needs to Move on Electronic Privacy Law, Data Protection Chief Says","BRUSSELS -- The top data protection official for the European Union called Tuesday for member governments to restore public trust in the Internet by pressing ahead with an overhaul of the bloc's electronic privacy laws by the end of this year. The official, Peter Hustinx, the European data protection supervisor, also called on President Obama to stick to his pledge to review American privacy rules in the wake of disclosures that have exposed the vast reach of government surveillance that has shaken trans-Atlantic relations.  Legislation to revamp European digital privacy law has been in the works since November 2010, when the European Union's justice commissioner, Vivian Reding, first proposed updating rules set during the mid-1990s in the early part of the Internet era. She presented her version of the legislation in January 2012. A separate bill, aimed at providing more equitable access for companies and consumers to the Internet -- ''net neutrality'' -- and making mobile phone roaming less costly to consumers is now before the European Parliament, which is to vote on that legislation Thursday. But Ms. Reding's digital privacy regulation is running on a separate track. Last month the European Parliament gave preliminary approval to a strengthened version of Ms. Reding's rules that would set higher fines and provide stronger bulwarks against demands by countries like the United States for access to data belonging to Europeans. But that version still needs to be reconciled with the views of the European Union's 28 member governments. As it stands, the proposed digital privacy law would establish fines that could run to billions of euros for giant American technology companies like Amazon and eBay if they failed to adhere to rules like limiting the sharing of personal data. Companies like Google and Facebook would also need to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States court warrants seeking private data. At a news conference Tuesday, Mr. Hustinx stressed the urgency of keeping the privacy legislation moving through the Council of the European Union in Brussels, the body in which national governments meet to adopt laws and coordinate policies. ''The problem is that the council is not ready yet,'' Mr. Hustinx said. Mr. Hustinx called on the bloc's 28 member states to reach a deal with one another and with the Parliament by the end of the year, because ''the 21st century requires stronger rights, stronger responsibilities, more consistency across Europe.'' Mr. Hustinx said European Union governments were ready to approve most of the current version of the privacy legislation, including a ''right to erasure'' that would enable users to demand that data be scrubbed from websites. But he suggested that governments could continue to hold up approval because of other elements, including difficulties reaching agreement on how to enforce uniform rules across the bloc and whether to apply the rules to the way civil servants in member countries handle data. Germany has been particularly forceful in seeking a broad carve-out for the public sector, because of a deep reluctance to modify its own existing privacy rules, which it regards as preferable. Britain, too, has reservations about how the law could create more red tape for businesses in an area of the economy with potential for growth. Mr. Hustinx also challenged the United States government to do more in updating its own rules. ''There are some interesting movements in Washington, but we'd like to see much more,'' he said. ''If trust should be rebuilt, then it certainly takes a number of actions at the other side as well.'' Mr. Hustinx suggested that European governments could be given added reassurance they would be in sync with the American approach to data privacy, if a group led by John Podesta, a special adviser to Mr. Obama, issues its report on data privacy this spring as expected. That study by Mr. Podesta, announced in January, is expected to review how businesses collect private data. But it might also suggest specific legislative proposals to give consumers more control of that information. ''To avoid a limping horse in the trans-Atlantic space, we need to have sufficient consistency,'' Mr. Hustinx said. "
Cisco: The Internet Needs More Control,"Cisco Systems is making an unusual case for itself: The Internet must be subject to a higher amount of control, and big companies will work with governments to make that possible. The message came in an announcement on Monday, rich in corporate partners and allies, that was intended to show Cisco's progress in creating its so-called Intercloud, a proposed network of cloud computing systems with high performance, security and control.  In addition to improving security, the Intercloud is meant to help companies comply with the regulations of countries regarding the information that moves within their borders. For example, in Germany, where personal data privacy is a priority, that sort of technology can help personal information stay out of public hands.  Also, important infrastructure like traffic control systems are increasingly run over the Internet. It's important that those systems have better security and control. ""Our critical infrastructure will all be connected,"" said Robert Lloyd, Cisco's president of development and sales. ""I don't think we want it to run on a public consumer cloud.""  But there is an obvious downside: This so-called data sovereignty means that digital information stored inside a country is subject to the laws of that country. In nations with less democratic views, that can mean censorship. ""I always thought data sovereignty was important,"" Mr. Lloyd said. ""Events of the last six to 12 months have accelerated the requirements for data sovereignty and privacy.""  Among the more than 30 companies that Cisco said had added their support to the Intercloud were Deutsche Telekom, British Telecommunications and Equinix. A number of other companies, Cisco said, are building cloud systems and applications that are compliant with the Intercloud. Deutsche Telekom is deploying Intercloud nodes into its data centers in Germany to meet that country's strict data protection standards. BT, with data centers in 20 countries on five continents, will deploy Cisco infrastructure that, a release announcing the partnership said, allows its customers ""to meet national compliance and assurance requirements and to communicate and contract under the jurisdiction of the local law."" Some of those laws may include which parts of the Internet people may or may not see. China already censors the web, and earlier this year Twitter was temporarily banned in Turkey. Mr. Lloyd did not say that Cisco supported such control, but noted that its network allowed better control of ""the ways customers can dial up and down"" flows of information. He added, ""I know there is a concern"" about how this may be used. Cisco is not the only big technology company promoting itself as an answer to the need for data protection. On Sunday evening in San Francisco, Oracle's founder and executive chairman, Lawrence J. Ellison, introduced several new cloud computing products that he said would provide greater security. Mr. Ellison also introduced a new product, called memory protection, which he said was a semiconductor-based monitoring system to prevent a malicious software application from gaining access to the memory of another application, usually an early step in a computer attack.  The innovation, he said, would eliminate many attacks. Cisco has long counted on government sales, and sales to telecommunications companies often closely tied to governments, and could use the outlet to protect its high-margin equipment sales. Mr. Lloyd also noted that so far 30 cloud providers were on track to use Cisco's top Nexus 9000 switch in their systems.  Cisco also made a nod to open source computing, in particular the OpenStack cloud software that is at the heart of its Intercloud. OpenStack has also been embraced by other big companies, including Hewlett-Packard, IBM and AT&T.                       "
Dutch Regulator Investigates Facebook's Privacy Policy,"LONDON - United States tech giants can't catch a break with Europe's privacy watchdogs. After other companies like Google have repeatedly run into issues with the region's strict data protection rules, Facebook is now in the crosshairs of the Dutch privacy regulator, which said on Tuesday that it was investigating the social network's revamped privacy policy.  The company's privacy statements - updated in November and to be introduced on Jan. 1 - tries to simplify the often hard-to-understand rules governing people's data stored on Facebook into concise and understandable language. But the new privacy policy also states that Facebook has the right to use the information provided by its more than 1.3 billion global users through their posts, messages and other online interactions for its own business goal: to sell more advertising. That use of people's personal information is at the heart of the Dutch privacy regulator's investigation, which will center on whether Facebook complies with local data protection rules that polices how people's data can - and cannot - be used. In a statement, the Dutch watchdog - called College Bescherming Persoonsgegevens, or C.B.P. - said it had contacted Facebook about how the new privacy policy would affect local users, and asked the social network to postpone the roll-out of the new rules until the regulator completes its investigation. The Dutch data protection authority has the power to fine a company if it breaches the country's privacy rules. On Monday, for example, the regulator said it would fine Google up to $18 million if the tech giant did not stop using people's online browsing history and location data to sell customized advertising to specific individuals. In response, Facebook said it was confident the new policy complied with the country's laws.  The social network's non-United States users, which are overseen by the Irish privacy regulator because the company's international headquarters are in Dublin, said that it had been in contact with the Irish watchdog about its new privacy policy. ""We were surprised and disappointed to learn about the C.B.P.'s inquiry,"" Facebook said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We routinely review product and policy updates with our regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who oversees our compliance with the E.U. Data Protection Directive as implemented under Irish law."" "
Ireland Lends Support to Microsoft in Email Privacy Case,"LONDON - The Irish government has given qualified support to Microsoft's efforts to block the American authorities from seizing a customer's emails that are stored in Ireland.  The move is linked to a continuing legal dispute over a United States search warrant for emails related to a drug trafficking investigation. Those messages are stored in a Microsoft data center in Dublin. While several courts in the United States have declared that the search warrant is lawful, Microsoft has argued that allowing the American authorities to issue search warrants for content overseas could set a dangerous precedent and increase privacy tensions between that country and the rest of the world. In a legal brief supporting Microsoft's appeal, the Irish government said that courts in the United States should respect the sovereignty of other countries when issuing search warrants, though it added that Ireland and the United States had existing treaties that could allow the data to be shared with the American authorities. ""Ireland has a genuine and legitimate interest in potential infringements by other states of its sovereign rights,"" lawyers for the country said in a support brief that was released late Tuesday. ""Foreign courts are obliged to respect Irish sovereignty."" The efforts by Ireland, which is home to operations of large American technology companies including Google and Facebook, marks the latest in a number of appeals by companies and civil liberty organizations against the United States government's efforts to obtain emails stored in the Irish data center. This month, organizations including Amazon, Apple, CNN, Fox News, The Washington Post, Verizon and almost two dozen other technology and media companies also filed briefs in support of the Microsoft case, which is now being considered in New York by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The tech companies said that a ruling against Microsoft could harm their own international operations, as  customers could become suspicious that their data will be easily accessible to the United States government. Like other American companies, Microsoft uses data centers around the world for cloud computing services like email and data storage. News organizations have also warned that foreign governments could use the case to try to gain access to data centers outside their jurisdictions to obtain emails and other information from American journalists. And in a separate legal brief filed to the court in support of Microsoft, Jan Philipp Albrecht, a member of the European Parliament from Germany who has called for tough privacy rules in the 28-country European Union, said that the ability of the United States to have unfettered access to data held in Europe would undermine the region's tough data protection laws. ""European citizens are highly sensitive to the differences between European and U.S. standards on data protection,"" Mr. Albrecht said in his brief. ""The successful execution of the warrant at issue in this case would extend the scope of this anxiety to a sizable majority of the data held in the world's data centers outside the U.S."" "
Dark Side to Internet of Things: Hacked Homes and Invasive Ads,"Home, connected home. The front door opens with a tap on an iPhone. The lights come up as if by magic. The oven sends a text: Dinner is ready.  You will probably be hearing a lot about these sorts of conveniences this week from the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco. Apple is expected to unveil software that promises to turn our homes into Wi-Fi-connected wonderlands, where locks, lights, appliances - you name it - can all be controlled via an iPhone or iPad. You can bet that before long, refrigerators will come with ""Made for iPhone"" stickers.  These initiatives are all part of what is known as the Internet of Things. That is a catchall term used to describe connectivity - specifically, how people connect with products, and how products connect with each other.   Sounds great. But I can't shake the feeling that one day, maybe, just maybe, my entire apartment is going to get hacked.  The word in Silicon Valley is that Apple has all the security issues locked down. But as any computer security expert will tell you, nothing - and I mean nothing - is impervious.  Hackers can crack governments and corporations, let alone smartphones and desktops. What's to stop them from hacking a connected house? Think back to those dark ages when the first smartphones arrived. Back then, few people worried about the privacy and security issues those products might pose. Look where we are today.  ""Obviously, there are lots of benefits of connected devices in the home, but there can also be complications,"" said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy group. ""When you worry about computer viruses, you can unplug your computer. When your house gets a virus, where do you go to hide?"" Take an incident that happened last week in Australia. Reports popped up on Apple forums and in the media that some people with iOS devices, including iPhones, iPads and Mac computers had been targeted in a ""digital hijacking"" operation. Hackers had commandeered the machines and rendered them unusable. A hacker going by the name ""Oleg Pliss"" demanded a $100 ransom, paid via PayPal, to unlock each one.  Now imagine what could happen to your house. You come home to unlock your front door or turn on your lights with your smartphone - and find yourself locked out, your home held hostage.  Laugh if you will. But we've already seen similar situations happen with cars. Last year, as an experiment, Charlie Miller, a security researcher at Twitter, and Chris Valasek, director of security intelligence at IOActive, a security research company, hacked into a Toyota Prius. In their demonstration, they disabled a driver's ability to control the steering and brakes. Just like the early days of the iPhone, we don't seem to be too worried that such intrusions could happen to a connected home. Maybe we're just starry-eyed.  A May report from Pew Research about the Internet of Things asked 1,606 experts on Internet-connected clothing and appliances to explain their visions of this future. The report is a cornucopia of delights about how our toothbrush will email our dentist, how the toilet paper dispenser will know when to order a new roll from Amazon, how our alarm clock will start our coffee maker minutes before we get up. The term ""hacker"" appears only once in the 30,000-word document. Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project, who oversaw the report, said people would initially see these new technologies as a ""gee-whiz phenomenon."" Only later will they start to worry about the potential problems.   ""There is a reference in our report to consumer willingness to embrace these things,"" Mr. Rainie said.  ""If they seem too powerful and know too much about us, consumers aren't going to want to adopt these products.""  The report also addressed another troubling aspect of the Internet of Things: the privacy implications. In that regard, hackers are only one worry. The companies that are actually making these technologies could become flies on our walls. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late last year, Google said it foresaw a future of ads in cars, watches, glasses, thermostats and so on.  Google has backtracked since, saying last week: ""We've contacted the S.E.C. to clarify our 2013 filing; it does not reflect Google's product road map."" But, as privacy experts noted, someone, somewhere inside Google has been thinking about putting ads in your home. ""These are devices that are designed to track people,"" Mr. Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center  said. ""You might start to wonder, why is my toaster spying on me?"" "
Big Data Means Big Questions on How That Information Is Used," CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - With the success of its free open online course system, called MITx, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology finds itself sitting on a wealth of student data that researchers might use to compare the efficacy of virtual teaching methods, and perhaps advance the field of Web-based instruction. Since its inception several years ago, for instance, MITx has attracted more than 760,000 unique registered users from about 190 countries, university officials said. Those users have generated 700 million interactions with the school's learning system and have contributed around 423,000 forum entries, many of them quite personal.  As researchers contemplate mining the students' details, however, the university is grappling with ethical issues raised by the collection and analysis of these huge data sets, known familiarly as Big Data, said L. Rafael Reif, the president of M.I.T.  For instance, he said, serious privacy breaches could hypothetically occur if someone were to correlate the personal forum postings of online students with institutional records that the university had de-identified for research purposes. ""How do we set the boundaries, and balance the competing interests?"" Dr. Reif asked in a public talk on Monday morning. ""If you believe in the potential of digital learning, you have to care about the larger question: How can we harness this flood of data to generate positive change - without destroying the very idea of privacy? Parallel questions hover over our work in field after field."" As the opening speaker at a workshop titled Big Data Privacy, sponsored by M.I.T. and the White House, Dr. Reif framed some of the big questions that have arisen from the increasing public and private sector use of powerful large-scale data-mining techniques. While proponents view such big data analytics as promising tools for discovering useful insights in medicine, education, marketing and many other fields, consumer advocates warn that without explicit federal rules or policies overseeing their use, computer-generated algorithms could potentially be used to identify people who would prefer to remain anonymous, or to discriminate unfairly. They could be used, for example, to offer some consumers perks while others are charged higher prices or interest rates.  With that in mind, President Obama in January started a federal review intended to examine the impact of big-data technologies and whether they might pose new kinds of privacy intrusions into how people live and work. The workshop at M.I.T. is the first in a series of academic events, sponsored in part by the White House, intended to explore the technologies involved in big data and the privacy problems they may pose, along with potential policy and technological solutions. One goal of the project, said John Podesta, the counselor to the president who is leading the Big Data Privacy review, is to determine how the public and private sectors might maximize the flow of information necessary for innovation while minimizing the potential privacy risks to individuals. ""What the president wants to explore, in part, is whether our existing privacy framework can accommodate these changes, or if there are new avenues for policy that we need to consider,"" Mr. Podesta said in a speech for the M.I.T. event, delivered by phone because snow conditions in Washington prevented him from attending in person. ""Have we fully considered the myriad ways in which this data revolution might create social value,"" he added, ""and have we fully contemplated the risks that it might pose to our conceptions of individual privacy, personal freedom and government responsibility of data?""   "
"Flaw Calls for Altering Passwords, Experts Say","A programming mistake from two years ago has forced countless websites to make fixes to protect the sensitive personal information of consumers. What consumers should do to protect their own information isn't quite as clear, because security experts have offered conflicting advice. Should users change their web passwords immediately or wait until sites have fixed the problem?  Changing a password before a site has dealt with the coding flaw, called Heartbleed, means the new password could be vulnerable, and the user will have to pick another password when it is fixed. But changing a password is a minor inconvenience compared to getting personal information like credit card numbers stolen. ''It certainly can't hurt to change your password now and then again next week,'' said Brian Krebs, a security researcher. ''That's not the biggest hardship in the world. It's a very simple thing to do and gives you a little peace of mind.'' The extent of the problem was still unclear on Wednesday. The researchers who discovered the flaw -- a simple error in a web security measure called OpenSSL -- said on Monday that up to two-thirds of websites could be affected. Other security experts said the number of sites could stretch into the hundreds of thousands. But some Internet, banking and retail companies said they were never vulnerable because they didn't use that type of security software or said they had already repaired the bad code. Google, Facebook and Yahoo confirmed they had been affected by the OpenSSL flaw and had applied fixes to their systems. Security experts said Yahoo users, in particular, should change their passwords, because that company had not completely patched its software until after the flaw became public. On Tuesday afternoon, while looking for vulnerabilities, researchers reported that they had been able to capture user names and passwords from Yahoo. Many of the country's largest retailers, like Amazon, Walgreens, Nordstrom and Target -- which suffered an enormous data breach of its own late last year -- said they were not affected. Nordstrom said it would post a statement on its website making clear that it had not been not affected, along with tips about keeping information safe online. Among major financial institutions, the impact also did not appear to be significant. A representative of JPMorgan Chase said it did not use the software that was affected by the Heartbleed flaw and it had determined that its users' login information was not compromised. Citigroup said in an email that its initial assessment was that its banking and credit card websites were not affected, but that it was ''taking appropriate steps'' to safeguard them. It also encouraged users to change passwords frequently and not to use the same passwords on many sites. Bank of America said the issue was industrywide and did not respond further. Marc Frons, the chief information officer of The New York Times Company, said the internal systems of The Times did not use the flawed version of OpenSSL, and no digital subscribers' information was at risk. He said some third-party companies that process home subscribers' credit-card information may have been affected, and the companies were investigating whether any breaches had occurred. Nonetheless, security experts said consumers should change their passwords at any site that holds sensitive data, especially because most people tend to use the same passwords on many sites. Even if Chase's websites didn't reveal your login information, a hacker might obtain it from another affected site. And the Heartbleed flaw is subtle. While there is no evidence it has been used to steal personal information, if hackers had done so, it would be almost impossible to tell. By Tuesday evening, simple tools to take advantage of the vulnerability were being shared on hacker forums, Mr. Krebs said. If a site has not yet fixed the problem, it is leaving customer information exposed. Also, no one knows how long malicious hackers could have known about the flaw before security researchers discovered it. Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer and security consultant who discovered the OpenSSL flaw on his own site, warned against taking the problem lightly. ''I've been saying that on a scale of one to 10, this is an 11,'' he said. Still, changing your passwords before sites were patched could simply lead to re-exposure, he said. That is why it is important to find out if a site has fixed the problem -- or has never had it -- before a password is changed. Security researchers and the password management company LastPass set up various Internet tools where consumers could check specific sites to see whether they were safe. ''It has to go in sequence, because the vulnerability is at the website,'' Mr. Schneier said. ''Because the password was stolen at the remote site, the remote site needs to fix itself before you can fix yourself.'' Mr. Krebs said he expected that major organizations would begin contacting their customers in the coming days and that some of them would even start forcing users to change their passwords. In the meantime, he said it was not a bad idea for consumers to make the changes even if it meant doing it again a few days from now. ''If you went to a vulnerable site and you logged in during the time that this was known by hackers,'' he said, ''there's a decent chance that somebody stole your password.'' "
Home Depot Investigates a Possible Data Breach,"Home Depot said on Tuesday that it was investigating a report that customer credit and debit card data was stolen from its systems and put up for sale online. The retailer issued a statement after Brian Krebs, an independent security reporter, said that multiple banks had pointed to Home Depot as the potential source of a large data breach. The company said it was working with law enforcement authorities and banks on the matter.  ''Protecting our customers' information is something we take extremely seriously, and we are aggressively gathering facts at this point while working to protect customers,'' said Paula Drake, a company spokeswoman. ''If we confirm that a breach has occurred, we will make sure customers are notified immediately.'' If a breach is confirmed, Home Depot will be the latest target in a recent string of hacking attacks against major companies, after Target, Neiman Marcus, Michaels, Sally Beauty, P. F. Chang's and UPS. Those companies said criminals had installed malicious software on their systems that siphoned customers' payment information. The hackers who broke into the systems are believed to belong to the same crime ring in Eastern Europe. The number of customers affected by the breaches amounts to more than one-third of the American population. In July, the Homeland Security Department and the Secret Service issued a report warning retailers to check their in-store cash register systems for a set of malware that could evade detection of antivirus products. The Secret Service estimated that over 1,000 businesses had been infected by the software, which security researchers called Backoff. Mr. Krebs said the potential infiltration of Home Depot's customer data might have begun as early as May. That could make a Home Depot breach even bigger than that of Target, which began in November and was reported in December. In that breach, Target said hackers had stolen credit or debit card information from about 40 million customers. The company also said criminals had stolen other pieces of personal information, like email and mailing addresses, from about 70 million people. In the attack against Target, data from the magnetic strips of stolen credit cards was sold online on sites like Rescator, a so-called carding site, for $18 to $40 a card. After an internal review, Target acknowledged that it had ignored warning signs of a potential infiltration last year. The retailer's security software had sounded multiple alarms as criminals uploaded the malware onto its systems. "
Protecting Your Business From a Data Breach,"This year, Home Depot's in-store payment system was hacked in what may have been the largest data breach of a retail company's computer network. It is unlikely to be the last. Many other well-known companies have been attacked, including Target, UPS, Michaels, P.F. Chang's China Bistro and Neiman Marcus. And many small businesses are even more vulnerable than large companies, because they can't afford the kind of data security a larger company can - and because they don't follow best practices. Andrew Bagrin, founder and chief executive of My Digital Shield, a data security firm in Wilmington, Del., that serves small businesses, says business owners often feel that because they are small, they really aren't at risk. ""So I'll ask them,"" he said, ""How many credit cards do you take in a month? A thousand? Then you're vulnerable.""   Hackers are looking for information they can use regardless of where it comes from, and Mr. Bagrin said there had been a spike in point-of-sale breaches. There are, however, some basic things small businesses can do to lower risk. The following suggestions come from Mr. Bagrin; from Armando D'Accordo, owner of CMIT Solutions in South Nassau, N.Y.; from Andrew Hoog, chief executive of viaForensics, a company in Oak Park, Ill., that provides security for mobile devices; and from Alan Brill, senior managing director of the cyber security unit at Kroll, which is based in New York.  Use your point-of-sale system for customer transactions only.   ""Most POS systems are computer systems, like an iPad, that have a POS system on them. Don't browse the Internet from it, shop on it, look at Facebook or Twitter with it,"" Mr. Bagrin said. When you browse the Internet, you make it easy for someone to introduce something malicious into your system.  Dedicate one computer for the company's purchasing, banking and confidential financial business.   Similarly, Mr. D'Accordo said the computer used for a company's bookkeeping, banking and purchasing should not be used to search the Internet or view social media sites. ""That machine should be dedicated to financial transactions only,"" he said, ""and should auto-lock in two minutes if it's not being used.""  Keep your hardware, operating system, software and apps up to date.  One way that malicious software, or malware, is able to gain access to a computer system and exploit it is through out-of-date hardware and software. All updates include security fixes, so having the latest versions keeps your system the most secure, Mr. Bagrin said.  Be careful about buying from unknown online vendors.  It's best not to make purchases from vendors you aren't familiar with, Mr. D'Accordo said. And be wary of those that are based in other countries or whose websites don't feature an https in their address or display the symbol for a padlock.  Use and update antiviral and antispyware software on all computers, including laptops and tablets.   If you can afford it, use a security service that updates those programs and scans your system in real time - as it's active - to ensure nothing malicious has been installed. My Digital Shield, for example, protects small businesses by scanning all the traffic on their network. ""Basically we take your traffic, plug your Internet into our system and we make it a clean Internet, filtering out all the harmful garbage,"" Mr. Bagrin said. The monthly subscription fee for this service ranges from $69 to $89. The cost for CMIT's security and maintenance services ranges from $200 a month for small businesses to $3,000 a month for larger ones, depending on the level of protection.  Plug leaky apps.  Mr. Hoog said his company had found that about 60 percent of the mobile apps it evaluated leaked information and had ""other security problems."" He said developers are under such tight deadlines that they move quickly and sometimes code improperly, leaving an app vulnerable. ""One thing small businesses don't realize is that even though Apple and Google do a bit of vetting, you can't trust you're going to get a safe and secure app from their stores. An app will leak out your address, customer list, suppliers, a password or a user name and send it out over the Internet without encryption. Hackers just harvest that data,"" Mr. Hoog said. ViaForensics offers a cloud-based product for small businesses - viaProtect- an app that assesses a mobile device, looking for leaky apps. It is free for individual private use and for up to eight corporate users. After that, it's $8 a  device. ViaProtect sends out security alerts that tell the phone's user which app has vulnerability and whether it is safe to use or should be upgraded.  Scan it, shred it or lock it up.  Data can be breached the old-fashioned way too, so Mr. D'Accordo tells clients to keep paper files to a minimum. If they must keep paperwork, it should be kept in locked file cabinets and scanned so there is always a digital backup. If the paper doesn't have to be kept, it should be shredded.  Clean house frequently.  Chances are you store information in your database that you no longer need. Mr. Brill suggested doing a yearly audit of your data. ""I call it going on a data diet,"" Mr. Brill said. ""But do it in conjunction with your legal counsel, and make sure whatever it is you're getting rid of won't get you into trouble.""

"With Its Stock Riding High, FireEye Sells More Shares for $1.1 Billion","With the Target hacking scandal, Edward Snowden and Chinese cyberattacks all in the news, there could hardly be a better environment for FireEye, the security software company that went public last fall.  Now, with its stock having risen fourfold since its market debut, the company is taking advantage by selling more shares. The secondary offering Thursday evening raised $1.1 billion, as FireEye sold 14 million shares for both itself and some of its earlier backers. Among those selling are FireEye's founder, Ashar Aziz, and chief executive, David G. DeWalt, as well as Norwest Venture Partners. It's the latest big news for the nine-year-old company, which specializes in defending against computer attacks by reading Internet traffic for potential threats. In January, the company bought Mandiant, a leading responder to hacking attacks, for more than $1 billion, a deal paid for in part with stock. Those shares have leaped, making the company's offering one of the most successful by any computer security provider. Pricing at $20 a share in its I.P.O., FireEye's shares have reached  as high as $97.35. (Its shares were down 9 percent, to around $81 a share, by late afternoon trading Friday, largely because of the new stock entering the market.) Mr. DeWalt said in an interview on Friday that during an abbreviated road show for the secondary offering, investors continued to show strong interest in the company. ""Every single investor believes that cybersecurity is critical,"" Mr. DeWalt said. ""FireEye is the leader in that domain."" With its share of the offering proceeds - nearly $458 million - the company plans to continue expanding, especially internationally. Among the areas that the company plans to focus on now are protecting mobile devices and cloud services, both of which are in need of stronger security. While FireEye plans to continue building out its offering, it will also look to make acquisitions, though probably at a smaller scale than the Mandiant deal. Ultimately, Mr. DeWalt says he believes that demand for his company's services will only grow in coming years. ""This is the new norm for cybersecurity,"" he said. ""We see increasing escalations around the world.""  "
"For China, Cybersecurity Is Part of Strategy for Protecting the Communist Party","For nearly two years, cyberespionage has been atense focal point of relations between the United States and China. On Wednesday, the Center for a New American Security, a research group in Washington, released a paper written with the aim of understanding the motivations behind China's cybersecurity strategy. Its conclusion: that the strategy, like China's foreign policy, is driven mainly by the domestic political imperative of needing to ""protect the longevity of the Chinese Communist Party."" The paper is based on readings of Chinese-language sources and tries to lay out reasons for why state-supported actors engage in cyberespionage and other activities. The paper's author, Amy Chang, a research associate in the center's technology and national security program, argues that there are three main components of the cybersecurity strategy - economic, political and military - and that they are all aimed at ensuring the survival of party rule.  For example, Ms. Chang writes that maintaining economic growth and stability, which is critical to legitimizing the party in the eyes of ordinary Chinese, is a goal of industrial economic cyberespionage, which the White House has said is carried out at least in part by hackers employed by the People's Liberation Army. China's cybersecurity strategy - which it calls ""network security"" (\xE7\x91[#x7edc][#x5b89][#x5168]) - also ranges from mastering information control and propaganda with the goal of preventing or quelling domestic instability to studying foreign adversaries' military infrastructure and capabilities in the cyber realm, according to the paper. Nevertheless, ""despite high-level guidance and strategic direction from Xi Jinping and senior civilian and military officials, implementation of China's cybersecurity strategy remains fragmented and its bureaucratic structure remains disorganized, characterized by competition for stakeholder resources and influence on policy direction,"" Ms. Chang wrote in the executive summary, referring to the Chinese president and party leader who is the head of the main policy group on cybersecurity. The 37-page paper is posted here. Ms. Chang began her research while studying for a master's degree at the Harvard Kennedy School and wrote her thesis on this subject under the guidance of Prof. Joseph S. Nye, Jr. A former resident of Beijing, she visited the Chinese capital again last month to attend a conference on foreign policy. She discussed her research with The New York Times:  Q.   What motivated you to write this report, and why did you decide to use Chinese-language primary source material as the foundation?   A.  There is plenty of content in Western media that highlights what China has done against the United States in the cyber realm, as well as how China conducted these operations, but not enough attention has been paid to why China does what it does against the U.S. and in the international sphere in cyberspace. Further, much less research has been accessible to the public that has used Chinese-language primary source material, which can reveal trends and nuances that are overlooked when analysts focus too closely on English-language sources. I was motivated to write the report because the state of U.S.-China cybersecurity relations had deteriorated so greatly that it started to affect other areas of the bilateral relationship. I hope that this report provides greater clarity on motivating factors for state behavior that would allow U.S. policy makers to better tailor policy solutions toward China.  Q.   Last month, around the time you were visiting Beijing, China's top Internet regulator, Lu Wei, organized what he called the World Internet Conference in Zhejiang Province. He met with Chinese and foreign business executives, and one of his main goals was to get others to support the concept of ""Internet sovereignty."" What are your thoughts on that?   A.  The World Internet Conference was an attempt by China to assert influence in the Internet governance debate, as well as legitimize many of its ""Internet management"" techniques in front of a global, high-level audience. China's counternarrative on Internet governance by promoting sovereignty on the Internet has little lasting effect among Western audiences - and open Asian societies such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan - especially when held in the light of Chinese behavior during the recent Hong Kong protests, domestic limitations on Chinese Internet - for example, real name registration on social media, censorship - and other behaviors exhibited by the regime over the years.  China capitalized on the Snowden leaks in 2013 - despite the differing economic and national security nature of espionage between the United States and China - to promote this counter-narrative, which gained some traction among nations that were angered by U.S. espionage activity or that wanted to exert greater control over their Internet. Beyond the limited number of supporters like Russia and Syria, China's efforts in this realm continue to fall on deaf ears. Whether or not China's activity in this sphere - i.e., asserting the Internet sovereignty narrative - will set a precedent for other nations, however, is to be seen, but should be watched closely.   Q.   You write that Xi Jinping has given high-level guidance on China's cybersecurity strategy, yet that strategy remains fragmented among competing organizations and individuals. To the best of your knowledge, which agencies or individuals are the most powerful drivers behind the policies?   A.  To my knowledge the Central Network Security and Informatization Leading Small Group, the National Security Commission and the State Informatization Leading Group have strong influence behind policies. However, I don't currently have enough information to infer which individuals are major drivers of their strategy or policy, beyond Xi Jinping and members of the N.S.C. and the leading groups. This is an interesting point that I will look into.  Q.   At the end of your paper, you say you'll give policy recommendations in a brief in 2015. Can you give us a preview of some of those recommendations?   A.  The recommendations will be multisectoral and iterative. One recommendation that I would consider would be to promote closer public-private cooperation to address China's extraction of information in a more cohesive and coordinated manner, as well as increase U.S. economic leverage and bargaining ability to change China's risk calculus.

Online Security Experts Link More Breaches to Russian Government,"SAN FRANCISCO -- For the second time in four months, researchers at a computer security company are connecting the Russian government to electronic espionage efforts around the world. In a report released on Tuesday by FireEye, a Silicon Valley firm, researchers say hackers working for the Russian government have for seven years been using sophisticated techniques to break into computer networks, including systems run by the government of Georgia, other Eastern European governments and militaries, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other European security organizations The report does not cite any direct evidence of Russian government involvement, such as a web server address or the individuals behind the attack, nor does it name the Russian agency responsible. The researchers have made the government connection because the malicious software used in the incidents was written during Moscow and St. Petersburg working hours on computers that use Russian language settings and because the targets closely align with Russian intelligence interests.  ''This is state espionage,'' Laura Galante, FireEye's manager of threat intelligence, said in an interview on Tuesday. ''This is Russia using its network operations to bolster their key political goals.'' Officials at the Russian Embassy in Washington could not be immediately reached for comment. Last year, FireEye acquired Mandiant, the security firm that teamed up with The New York Times to identify the unit of China's People's Liberation Army responsible for thousands of cyberattacks on United States companies, government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. FireEye is one of several security firms to tie the Russian government to hacking incidents. In July, three security firms, Symantec, F-Secure and CrowdStrike, also tied a string of coordinated attacks on Western oil and gas companies to Moscow. United States intelligence analysts have long cited Russia as a major concern. One top-secret 2009 National Security Agency intelligence estimate obtained by The New York Times last year named Russia as the most sophisticated adversary for the United States in cyberspace. But diplomatic efforts have predominantly been aimed at curbing digital threats from China. Attacks from hackers in China are typically less sophisticated, but far more prolific than those originating in Russia. The FireEye report notes, however, that it is often difficult to discern between Russian government attacks and attacks conducted by Russian cybercriminals. ''You only exist as a significant Russian cybercriminal if you abide by three rules,'' said Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro, a security firm based in Irving, Tex. ''You are not allowed to hack anything within the sovereign boundary; if you find anything of interest to the regime you share it; and when called upon for 'patriotic activities,' you do so. In exchange you get 'untouchable status.' '' One top-secret 2009 N.S.A. report, for example, named the Russian Nashi, a pro-Kremlin youth group, as the culprit behind the powerful 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia that nearly crippled the Baltic nation. American officials also said Russian hackers were responsible for a similar attack on Kyrgyzstan in January 2009 that, analysts suspected, was connect to efforts to persuade Kyrgyzstan's president to evict an American military base there. Shortly after the attacks ceased, Kyrgyzstan announced plans to remove the military base and received $2 billion in aid and loans from Moscow. Those attacks were distributed denial-of-service, or so-called DDoS attacks, aimed at flooding foreign networks with web traffic to knock them offline. Over the last seven years, FireEye researchers say, Moscow has crafted and honed sophisticated malware tools and deployed them, in many cases undetected, on the networks of its neighbors and adversaries. The espionage campaign, called APT28 by researchers at FireEye, started in 2007. Security researchers say professional hackers have been infecting their targets with malware, using emails containing malicious links and attachments. This malware can change its characteristics, making it hard to detect. Researchers say the malware is particularly good for creating back doors into computer networks that allow hackers to come and go without being detected. The code is also designed to be flexible, allowing its builders to adjust it and add new features, and it uses encryption to evade security researchers. It was also built to stop running malicious programs the second it recognizes an attempt to reverse-engineer the code, which is a sign that it has been detected. Ms. Galante said FireEye's researchers uncovered the campaign on computer networks of some of its clients. They were able to reverse-engineer the code enough to uncover many tools and signatures and unearth more about the people and operation behind it before the malicious programs stopped running. The FireEye research was reported by The Wall Street Journal. The targets, FireEye's researchers say, include the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia and its Ministry of Defense, journalists writing on Caucasus issues, and the Kavkaz Center, an international news agency focused on issues in Chechnya, Russia, and Islam. Researchers have also tied the campaign to attacks on the governments of Poland and Hungary and an Eastern European government's ministry of foreign affairs. European security organizations, including NATO, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Baltic Host, a military exercise, have also been targets. The firm's researchers also note that the same group has spied on governments and organizations that are not deemed immediate Russian threats, including the Chilean military, the government of Mexico, and the Al-Wayi news organization, a Russian-language magazine for readers in the Middle East. Those targets are not necessarily outliers, Ms. Galante said, because they would be of interest to any government. What convinced FireEye's researchers that the campaign was the work of the Russian government, she said, was the malware. ''The malware indicates a seven-year espionage effort, operating and developed over time,'' Ms. Galante said. ''This is a professional, well-resourced effort that has been going on for years.'' "
Sony Pictures and F.B.I. Widen Inquiry Into Hackers' Attack,"LOS ANGELES -- Sony Pictures Entertainment and the F.B.I. on Wednesday were seeking more information about an attack that crippled Sony's computer systems -- including whether North Korea, or perhaps a former employee, was responsible. ''The investigation continues into this very sophisticated cyberattack,'' the studio said in a statement. It added that a news report by the technology site Re/code, which said that North Korea had been identified as the source of the attack and that the studio planned an imminent announcement, was ''not accurate.''  Sony was hit by hackers on Nov. 24, resulting in a companywide computer shutdown and the leak of corporate information, including the multimillion-dollar pre-bonus salaries of executives and the Social Security numbers of rank-and-file employees. A group calling itself the Guardians of Peace has taken credit for the attacks. The studio, working with various law enforcement agencies, has been exploring whether the breach was related to one of Sony's coming movies, ''The Interview,'' a comedy about two American tabloid TV journalists recruited to assassinate the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. North Korean officials have been sharply critical of the film. On Monday evening, the F.B.I. issued a confidential five-page flash warning to security administrators at American corporations about a recently discovered form of destructive malware. The F.B.I. did not name Sony in the warning, which was obtained by The New York Times, but said that the malware was written in Korean and was ''destructive'' in nature. It commands a computer to sleep for two hours, after which the computer is shut down, rebooted and directed to start wiping all of its files, the agency said. Meanwhile, a second American company, Deloitte, the consulting and auditing firm, was victimized on Wednesday after the hackers that hit Sony published confidential Deloitte data on Pastebin, an anonymous posting website. The data included salary information for more than 30,000 of its employees. It was not clear whether the data was on Sony's computer networks because of its work with Deloitte -- the entertainment company has hired Deloitte in the past -- or whether it was carried over by a former Deloitte employee now working at Sony. The leaked data is likely to raise embarrassing questions about Deloitte's own insider-threat program. The firm has aggressively marketed its digital threat intelligence services and has been providing advice to corporations about how to protect data from employee leaks. Four months ago, Deloitte sponsored an article in The Wall Street Journal about how companies can more quickly identify employees who take internal data -- the very issue it now finds itself addressing. Jonathan Gandal, a Deloitte spokesman, said the company was aware of reports indicating that older Deloitte data may have been taken from a third party, but he said it could not confirm the veracity of the information. Regarding leaked salary information, Mr. Gandal said: ''Deloitte has long been recognized as a leader in its commitment to pay equality and all forms of inclusion.'' Though most of the speculation about the Sony breach has centered on North Korea, there are other possibilities under investigation, including that the attack was tied instead to an employee or former employee. Though online attacks are becoming routine, it is rare for victims to be able to identify their attacker, and even rarer to see a company name them publicly. But the hacking at Sony stands out from the scores of other attacks at American companies in the last year. The attackers did not just steal data, they also defaced Sony's websites with ominous images of red skeletons and warnings and filled the company's Twitter feeds with rants. The may have also facilitated the online pirating of five Sony films, including the unreleased ''Annie.'' Jaime Blasco, a malware researcher at AlienVault, a security company in San Mateo, Calif., said that the attacks were routed through Internet Protocol addresses in Bolivia, Cyprus, Italy, Poland, Thailand and the United States, but that these were most likely hacked systems ''that the attackers use to hide their origin.'' Mr. Blasco said that the Sony hacker or hackers ''clearly had insider information into the company's system, such as the names of the company's internal directories and passwords to its internal servers.'' "
Privacy Group Complains to F.T.C. About Facebook Emotion Study,"A leading privacy group filed a formal complaint on Thursday with the Federal Trade Commission over a 2012 study in which Facebook manipulated the news feeds of nearly 700,000 users of the social network to see what effect the changes would have on their emotions.  The group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said Facebook had deceived its users and violated the terms of a 2012 consent decree with the F.T.C., which is the principal regulatory agency overseeing consumer privacy in the United States. ""The company purposefully messed with people's minds,"" the advocacy group wrote in its complaint. ""At the time of the experiment, Facebook did not state in the Data Use Policy that user data would be used for research purposes. Facebook also failed to inform users that their personal information would be shared with researchers."" In the study, which lasted for one week in January 2012, Facebook changed the number of positive and negative posts that users saw in their feeds to see how that affected the emotional tone of the posts they made afterward. The research, which was published in an academic journal last week, found that people who were exposed to more negative material went on to write slightly more negative posts, and vice versa. Facebook never sought formal permission from users for the study, arguing that its data use policy already gave it sufficient permission to conduct the research. But the privacy group noted that at the time of the emotion study, the company's data policy did not tell users that their personal information could be used for research purposes. Regulators in Ireland and Britain are also asking questions about Facebook's actions in the study. The company has apologized and said it has since adopted stricter internal standards for reviewing studies before they are begun. ""When someone signs up for Facebook, we've always asked permission to use their information to provide and enhance the services we offer,"" Jodi Seth, a Facebook spokeswoman, said on Thursday. ""To suggest we conducted any corporate research without permission is complete fiction. Companies that want to improve their services use the information their customers provide, whether their privacy policy uses the word 'research' or not."" On Wednesday, Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said that the company was in communication with regulators all over the world and that ""this will be O.K."" The F.T.C., as is its practice, declined to comment on the complaint. "
F.T.C. Fines Yelp and TinyCo for Violating Children's Privacy Rules,"WASHINGTON - Tiny Pets, Tiny Zoo, Tiny Monsters and other mobile apps aimed at children have been downloaded more than 34 million times, often - not surprisingly - by children. But TinyCo, the maker of the apps, failed to recognize that strict rules apply to collection of information from children online, according to federal regulators.  The Federal Trade Commission announced on Wednesday that TinyCo Inc. had agreed to pay a $300,000 civil penalty to settle charges that it improperly collected children's information in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, known as Coppa. Yelp Inc. also agreed to settle similar, unrelated charges and pay a $450,000 civil penalty for improperly collecting the same type of information through its consumer review app. Both companies were charged with violating Coppa because, in part, they failed to obtain a parent's consent before collecting personal information from children under 13. ""As people - especially children - move more of their lives onto mobile devices, it's important that they have the same consumer protections when they're using an app that they have when they're on a website,"" said Jessica Rich, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection. ""Companies should take steps as they build and test their apps to make sure that children's information won't be collected without a parent's consent."" Yelp failed to include a screen that alerted it when a user entered an age of under 13, the F.T.C. said, although it has one on its website and the app required a user to enter a birthdate. Thus, the company collected email addresses, names, locations and all information posted on Yelp from users that it knew were under 13. Under the terms of settlement, Yelp must delete all information collected from consumers who stated they were 13 or under at the time they registered for the service, except in cases where the company can prove that the consumers were actually older than 13. TinyCo's apps were clearly targeted at children, the F.T.C. said, using brightly colored animated characters and simple language. Many of the apps had an optional feature that collected email addresses. In some cases, providing an email address won a user extra currency for use to buy in-game items or to speed up play. TinyCo failed to follow the steps required under Coppa related to the collection of children's information, the commission said. The company agreed to delete the information it gathered from children under 13.  In addition to the fines, each company agreed to submit a report to the agency in one year documenting its compliance with Coppa. Vince Sollitto, a spokesman for Yelp, said: ""We're glad to have been able to cooperate with the F.T.C. to get to a quick resolution and look forward to continuing our efforts to protect our users."" TinyCo, which like Yelp is based in San Francisco, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the sanctions.                       "
White House Tech Advisers: Online Privacy Is a 'Market Failure',"The White House published two lengthy reports on big data and privacy last Thursday. The one that got all the attention, understandably, was the review led by John D. Podesta, a senior adviser to the White House. It was the more general report and concluded with a handful of policy recommendations, including developing government limits on how companies use the vast amounts of information they collect about people. The second reportwas billed as a technical assessment and was produced by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, or PCAST. The group consists of academics, government scientists and industry representatives. The working group for last week's report had a large dose of members from the big data business - Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google; Craig Mundie, senior adviser to the chief executive of Microsoft; and Mark Gorenberg, head of Zetta Venture Partners, which invests in data start-ups.  Privacy groups, including the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Center for Digital Democracy, were critical of the science and technology advisers' report for recommending that policy should focus mainly on the use of data rather than in the collection of data. Privacy advocates say that allowing companies to collect all kinds of data - from web browsing to buying habits - opens the door to abuses like discriminating against the poor, older people or minorities, or deploying marketing tactics that exploit them. Industry executives and others who prefer regulating the use of data say there is so much of it out there already, and more all the time, that trying to curb data collection is impractical and not likely to be effective. Besides, they add, there is a fast-growing economy fueled by data, generating jobs and wealth for America. The appropriate target for policy is a reasonable subject of debate. But I was struck by the candor and clarity on certain critical issues in the PCAST report, especially given its membership. The current approach to online privacy is built around the notion that informed consumers can make reasonable choices; in legal terms it is called ""notice and consent."" This concept - or myth - of the empowered consumer means individuals have to fend for themselves in the bewildering, opaque arena of online privacy and marketing practices. ""It fundamentally places the burden of privacy protection on the individual,"" the PCAST report states. ""Notice and consent creates a nonlevel playing field in the implicit privacy negotiation between provider and user."" The report went on to explain with the example of a person browsing through a website, seeking information or goods to buy, and being confronted with a ""terms of service"" page. ""The provider,"" the report states, ""offers a complex, take-it-leave-it set of terms, while the user, in practice, can allocate only a few seconds to evaluating the offer. This is a kind of market failure."" That is hardly the only way the market for online privacy is tilted against the individual. In an interview last week, Mr. Podesta repeatedly used the term ""asymmetry"" to describe the present state of affairs, in which consumers have little idea of how data about their online behavior is collected, traded and analyzed, or for what purposes. To simplify for the purpose of explanation: On one side of the screen is grandma looking for information on arthritis treatments and for gifts for her grandchildren, while on the other side of that screen is a Ph.D. quant from Google, a Silicon Valley start-up or some other company, looking to maximize grandma's value. The answer, the PCAST report suggests, is to change the market, shifting the responsibility for privacy. ""The primary burden,"" the report states, ""must fall on the commercial user of big data and not on the consumer."" If that occurred, it would be a big change indeed. The challenge is how to make that happen. In broad strokes, the answer is some combination of rules and tools. The PCAST report surveys the recent technological progress in data tagging, so-called accountable systems, and automated personal profiles that contain a person's privacy preferences. Outside groups, the report states, could offer competing privacy-preference profiles. The report suggested a few hypothetical examples. A profile supplied by the American Civil Liberties Union might give particular weight to individual rights, while a profile offered by Consumer Reports might be weighted toward economic value for the consumer. Technology can help, the report states, but it is not the whole answer. ""Rules and regulations provide both deterrence of harmful actions and incentives to deploy privacy-protecting technologies,"" the report states. ""Privacy protection cannot be achieved by technical measures alone."" The concept of changing market incentives and responsibilities has a lot of appeal. That's what happened in consumer finance. A few rules were set in place, including a $50 limit on individual liability for fraudulent changes on a credit card that was lost or stolen. So it fell to the banking industry to make credit card fraud a small, manageable problem to protect their profits. The banking industry made huge investments in computing technology to do just that. And the credit card industry flourished. Online privacy is a different market, but the principle is the same.  "
Senators Intend to Amend Federal Student Privacy Law,"In an effort to beef up protections for the personal details about students that schools may share with app developers and other companies, two prominent senators said on Wednesday that they intend to modernize a decades-old federal education privacy law.  The law, called the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Right Act of 1974, or FERPA for short, generally requires schools that receive public financing to obtain parents' permission before sharing intimate details about their children with third parties. It also gives parents the right to review their children's educational records and request corrections to them. But an exception in the law allows schools to outsource school functions, like data processing and analytics, to companies without obtaining parental consent. The kinds of information schools share with third parties may include details like a student's name, disciplinary history, disabilities, family relationships, home address, test scores and attendance records. Now Senator Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, say that law needs to be amended to keep pace with the proliferation of student data that has resulted from increased technology use in schools. The senators today made public draft legislation to amend the educational privacy law. It would: - Require schools to maintain and make available a list of all outside companies that have access to their students' information. - Give parents the right to review and correct personal information collected about their children by educational apps, online homework software or any other school vendors. - Minimize the amount of students' personal details that schools could transfer to companies. - Prohibit the use of students' personal information to market products or services to them. - Require data security safeguards to protect sensitive student data collected by companies. ""The draft legislation would ensure that students are better protected when data is shared with and held by third parties, and parents are able to control the sensitive information of their children,"" a news release from Mr. Markey's office said. Mr. Markey has long been a staunch advocate of children's online privacy. His recent effort on behalf of student data privacy began last fall after he learned about parental objections to inBloom, a new student data repository. inBloom had proposed to streamline the way that schools aggregated their students' records and shared them with selected education technology vendors. In October, Mr. Markey sent a letter to the Department of Education, citing an investigation of inBloom by The New York Times, in which he asked regulators to explain whether the educational privacy law covered student information shared by schools with private companies. Now, the senators are proposing to amend the law to close what they see as loopholes in student data protection. In April, inBloom, the student data repository, announced it would close.  "
"Data Breaches in New York Hit Record High in 2013, State Attorney General Says","Last year was a record-setting one for the state of New York - and not in a good way. Public and private institutions in New York experienced more than 900 data breaches in 2013, according to a report released by the state attorney general on Tuesday. Those breaches exposed the personal and financial records of 7.3 million New Yorkers.  The report, which showed the effects of data security intrusions on New Yorkers over the past eight years, said computer hackers were by far the leading cause of the breaches, accounting for nearly 40 percent of unauthorized data access during that time. In 2013 alone, the breaches cost the public and private sectors more than $1.37 billion, the report said. Losses were calculated by assuming that a data breach costs an affiliated company approximately $188 for each person whose data was compromised, a figure published in a 2013 report by the security company Symantec and the Ponemon Institute, which researches information security. ""What's truly shocking about this report, beyond the fact that hacking is now the greatest threat to our personal information and costs us billions of dollars, is that many of these breaches could have been prevented,"" Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said in a statement. ""If millions of New Yorkers were exposed, one can only imagine how many have been compromised across the nation."" The report comes after an increase in the number of digital attacks on public and private institutions in recent years; in mid-March, Chinese hackers infiltrated United States government systems to obtain information on federal employees, officials said. And in 2011, Sony's popular PlayStation Network for gamers was repeatedly the target of hackers, exposing the names, email addresses and user names of millions of customers. In 2013, intrusions in New York were largely driven by two high-profile hacks, the report said: the huge breach at Target, in which millions of credit card numbers, addresses and phone numbers were stolen, as well as an attack on LivingSocial, a site for deals and discounts.  The report said that other businesses, of all sizes, also had experienced data breaches, including those in the financial and health services industries.                        "
Betting on Security Start-Ups in an Age of Data Breaches,"The hackers appear to be winning. Each month, it seems, another company's records get compromised and another shadowy group amasses millions of private documents. The result: Today, any consumers, companies or entrepreneurs who have been paying attention to the news are thinking long and hard about cybersecurity. And so are Silicon Valley's sharpest investors. Investment into security start-ups has soared in recent years, creating opportunity for entrepreneurs and risk for venture capitalists trying to avoid the kinds of bandwagon companies that fade away as a market starts to mature.  Last year, there were 240 investments worth a combined $1.7 billion in such companies, up from 83 investments worth just $340 million in 2009, according to CB Insights, a research firm that follows venture money. Those numbers continue to grow. The second quarter of this year was the biggest ever for such investments by dollar value, with $767 million put to work through 56 deals. ""When everybody gets a new credit card mailed out to them because Home Depot got hacked, it's on everybody's minds,"" said Scott Weiss, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm. More important than proverbial mindshare, security spending is a growing part of corporate technology budgets. A decade ago, most large information technology customers would spend 2 to 6 percent of their budget on security, estimates Asheem Chandna, a partner at Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm. These days, it is more like 5 to 15 percent, creating an estimated $80 billion-a-year market for security products and services. The rush of money backing security companies is skewing valuations, just as in other pockets of the tech industry across Silicon Valley. While that can be good news for entrepreneurs and employees at start-ups, it makes it more difficult for venture capitalists to place prudent bets. ""There's an inflation of valuations across the board,"" said Karim Faris, general partner at Google Ventures. ""It's an entrepreneurs' market. That makes life a bit more difficult as you look to take early-stage risks."" Several types of security companies are attracting the attention of investors. One is the business of making sure that the person getting access to certain information is authorized to do so. So-called access control and identity management companies are becoming ever more important as employees work from the road, using their own mobile devices to read and edit confidential documents. Google Ventures has backed one such company, Duo Security, which lets people use their mobile phones to complete two-factor authentication - a type of security that requires a password and another item like a fingerprint or randomly generated number to be used before access is allowed to a secure network. Other companies are trying to create online environments that limit the risk of contagion. Bromium, a start-up that Andreessen Horowitz has invested in, creates secure spaces in the computing cloud for different processes, making it less likely that hackers can expand their reach if they have infiltrated a network. And then there are companies like Skyhigh Networks, backed by Greylock, which monitors networks for unusual activity and alerts administrators if something goes awry - as it often does. ""High-profile security breaches have piqued the interest of new investors,"" Mr. Faris said. ""You see an incident a week these days in the popular press and a lot more in the security press."" The recent totals were also bolstered by two late-round investments: a $40 million Series C round for Skyhigh Networks in June and a $42 million Series E round for Centrify, which makes identity management software. Start-ups are at the vanguard of these specialized products and services. As a result, established security companies - like Juniper, Symantec and others - are working to compete. Over the last five years, the venture capital arms of companies like Salesforce.com and Samsung have spent $1.4 billion investing in security companies, through more than 140 deals, according to CB Insights. Executives at some older security companies are aware that the industry is changing around them. ""The way we deliver information to customers is not as compelling as some of these other solutions,"" said Jeff Scheel, who leads strategy, partners and alliances for Symantec. But Mr. Scheel said that technology was changing so fast that even some startups could be outdated soon. ""The computing infrastructure is going to change even more dramatically,"" he said. What is more, Symantec has a much larger customer base than start-ups. ""We have an opportunity to do it at a scale that doesn't exist at some of these other companies that are growing fast but that are an order of magnitude smaller than what we're doing on a daily basis,"" Mr. Scheel said. ""We're in 200 million enterprise endpoints and 120 million consumer endpoints."" But a problem for the big companies is what they can't offer: a chance at striking it rich with an initial public offering. Among engineers who are coveted for their coding skills, working at a fast-growing security company can be just as attractive as working at popular Internet companies like Dropbox or Box. ""There's a war raging out there for security talent,"" said Mr. Faris, alluding to the sky-high salaries top engineers can earn. The war is raging for good reason. Successful security companies can become worth billions. Since going public in 2012, Palo Alto Networks stock has doubled in value and is now worth nearly $9 billion. Barracuda Networks, which went public in 2013, is up more than 66 percent, with a valuation of nearly $2 billion. And while FireEye, a network security company that went public in 2013, is trading below its offer price, it is still richly valued and has already struck a $1 billion deal to acquire the cyberforensics firm Mandiant. But how do investors pick the winners and losers? After all, it is unlikely that all of these companies will survive, and most that do will be acquired rather than go public, Mr. Chandna said. ""The landscape is littered with 'me too' companies,"" he said. But the security companies that survive could have more staying power, so some investors are professing patience. ""Our advice to these entrepreneurs, especially when we have conviction around these companies, is to go play the long ball,"" Mr. Weiss said. ""If you can get to be a platform, there's a multibillion-dollar opportunity there.""                       "
Law Firms Pressed to Tighten Defenses Against Hackers,"A growing number of big corporate clients are demanding that their law firms take more steps to guard against online intrusions that could compromise sensitive information as global concerns about hacker threats mount. Wall Street banks are pressing outside law firms to demonstrate that their computer systems are employing top-tier technologies to detect and deter attacks from hackers bent on getting their hands on corporate secrets either for their own use or sale to others, said people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Some financial institutions are asking law firms to fill out lengthy 60-page questionnaires detailing their cybersecurity measures, while others are doing on-site inspections. Other companies are asking law firms to stop putting files on portable thumb drives, emailing them to nonsecure iPads or working on computers linked to a shared network in countries like China and Russia where hacking is prevalent, said the people briefed on the matter. In some cases, banks and companies are threatening to withhold legal work from law firms that balk at the increased scrutiny or requesting that firms add insurance coverage for data breaches to their malpractice policies.  ""It is forcing the law firms to clean up their acts,"" said Daniel B. Garrie, executive managing partner with Law & Forensics, a computer security consulting firm that specializes in working with law firms. ""When people say, 'We won't pay you money because your security stinks,' that carries weight."" The vulnerability of American law firms to online attacks is a particular concern to law enforcement agencies because the firms are a rich repository of corporate secrets, business strategies and intellectual property. One concern is the potential for hackers to access information about potential corporate deals before they get announced. Law enforcement has long worried that law firms are not doing enough to guard against intrusions by hackers. In 2011, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began organizing meetings with the managing partners of top law firms in New York and other major American cities to highlight the problem of computer security and corporate espionage, especially for law firms with offices in foreign countries like China and Russia. Despite those meetings, F.B.I. officials and security experts say, law firms remain a weak link when it comes to online security. But the push from corporate clients may have more impact on changing law firm attitudes than anything else. ""Clients are putting more restrictions on law firms about things to do to protect themselves,"" said Mary E. Galligan, an executive in the cyber-risk services division of Deloitte & Touche and the former special agent in charge of cyber and special operations for the New York office of the F.B.I. ""It is being driven by victims of hackers, and they don't want to be victims again. It's just good business sense."" When she was with the F.B.I., Ms. Galligan organized the meetings with managing partners of law firms to impress on them the need to better police their computer systems. The first meeting, held in New York in November 2011, was attended by top lawyers from nearly 200 firms. Over the next two years, Ms. Galligan said, she arranged half a dozen smaller meetings with law firm executives around the country. She said it had taken awhile, but she saw law firms being more proactive about computer security in large part because of the demand from clients. Companies are prodding law firms on security at a time of overall rising concern about hacker attacks like the information breach at Target last year, when the retailer said at least 40 million credit and debit card accounts were compromised. Financial regulators are also requiring banks to make sure that vendors they rely on, like law firms, are vigilant when it comes to dealing with hackers and other online intruders. ""The public and private sectors must be riveted in lock step in addressing these threats,"" Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Wednesday at a round-table discussion on the obligations of public companies to disclose online attacks. The discussion brought together more than two dozen security experts from the federal government and the financial services sector. Still, spying by governments both at home and abroad and how that could involve a breach of client confidence is also a concern for businesses. In February, The New York Times reported that communications between lawyers at Mayer Brown, a big Chicago-based law firm, and officials with the Indonesian government were intercepted by an Australian intelligence agency that had ties to the National Security Agency, the federal agency that has been under siege for nearly a year because of its domestic spying program. The American Bar Association, with nearly 400,000 members, sent a letter to the N.S.A. to say it was incumbent on the security agency to make sure the principle of attorney-client privilege was protected. Stuart Pattison, a senior vice president with Endurance Specialty Holdings, an underwriter of professional liability insurance coverage for law firms, said the main concern for the F.B.I. was state-sponsored hackers breaching a law firm computer system to tap into information about what American corporations were doing. He said that a few law firms had recently inquired about obtaining an added level of insurance coverage for data breaches in response to a demand from their corporate clients. Despite the concern, it's hard to gauge just how vulnerable law firms are to attacks from hackers. There are few rules requiring firms to make public any breaches, and because the firms have little direct interaction with consumers, there is no need for them to publicly report a hacking incident the way a bank or a retailer would. In 2012, Mandiant, a security consulting firm, put out a report estimating that 80 percent of the 100 largest American law firms had some malicious computer breach in 2011. Actual reports of confidential information hacked from a law firm computer system and later winding up on some overseas server are rare, however. Representatives for several large law firms, all of whom declined to discuss the topic publicly, said privately that the threat assessments from the F.B.I. and consulting firms were overstated. The law firm representatives said hacker attacks were usually email ""phishing"" schemes seeking to access personal information or account passwords, the kind of intrusions that have become commonplace and are easily contained. But Vincent I. Polley, a lawyer and co-author of recent book for the American Bar Association on cybersecurity, said many law firms were not even aware they had been hacked. He said a lot of law firm managers were in denial about the potential threat. ""A lot of firms have been hacked, and like most entities that are hacked, they don't know that for some period of time,"" said Mr. Polley. ""Sometimes, it may not be discovered for a minute or months and even years.""  "
Privacy Group Challenges Surveillance Practices in Britain,"LONDON - British privacy advocates introduced a legal challenge on Tuesday against one of the  country's intelligence agencies, saying the agency illegally hacked personal computers. The case follows revelations that Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, or G.C.H.Q., developed so-called malware that allowed the government to turn on computer microphones and  cameras without the owners' consent.  The activities allowed the British intelligence agency to collect information like gender, marital status and the education level of individuals, according to Privacy International, the group filing the complaint.  Privacy International said it filed the complaint with Britain's investigatory powers tribunal, a court that handles legal cases against the country's intelligence agencies. The group said that intelligence  agencies did not have the right to conduct such surveillance and asked that it be stopped. ''The hacking programs being undertaken by G.C.H.Q. are the modern equivalent of the government entering your house, rummaging through your filing  cabinets, diaries, journals and correspondence, before planting bugs in every  room you enter,'' Eric King, Privacy International's deputy director, said in a statement. A representative of G.C.H.Q. was not immediately available for comment. The British intelligent agency and the National Security Agency, its counterpart in the United States, are already facing a number of legal challenges connected to their surveillance activities. Edward  J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, revealed that the United  States and British government bodies had collected data from smartphone applications that revealed location, age  and other personal information, according to British intelligence documents. The N.S.A. also has been accused of  the widespread collection of foreigners'  phone and email traffic and reportedly  hacked the personal phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. This latest legal challenge, also based  on revelations by Mr. Snowden, will take up to six months for the British court to hear, Privacy International  said. The complaint filed Tuesday focuses on specific programs that gave G.C.H.Q. and the N.S.A. illegal access to individuals' computers. The different types of  software used had names like Nosey  Smurf, Tracker Smurf and Foggybottom, Privacy International added.   "
When Baby Pictures Offend the Law,"To the Editor: Re ''Baby Pictures at Doctor's? Cute, Sure, but Illegal'' (front page, Aug. 10): I have been caring for patients with breast cancer and hematologic disorders for almost 40 years in private practice and in academia. During that time I have accumulated hundreds of pictures, mostly of babies born after recovery from cancer, but also of other similar events like weddings and graduations. Some of my patients send me yearly pictures, usually around Christmas, extending through the graduations and marriages of their children. I have often shared these pictures, which I keep in several albums, with patients confronting new and frightening diagnoses so that they might understand that there is a possibility of a normal life in the future. It reassures them and makes me feel good. I have never had a patient object to my use of those pictures.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa, passed by politicians and administered by bureaucrats who have no idea what we do, has created a nightmare of meaningless paperwork, oversight and requirements that have further eroded what little humanity is left in American medicine. ARTHUR L. LEVY New Haven, Aug. 10, 2014 The writer is an associate clinical professor of medicine at the Yale University School of Medicine. To the Editor: I am appalled by the banning of the display of baby pictures in the offices of obstetricians. In this Orwellian era of government surveillance of our personal communications and the Internet's making a mockery of any semblance of privacy, one can only marvel at the government's ability to find one more way to waste our tax money. The protection of patient privacy should always be a major goal for the professional community. Unfortunately, Hipaa, with its petty and meaningless regulations, does nothing to further that goal. CAROL H. DEDOV Philadelphia, Aug. 10, 2014 The writer is a registered nurse. To the Editor: Would someone tell me why you would not be able to post baby pictures on the wall of the pediatrician's office because of privacy but be able to find all of our private information on the Internet? Criminals are taking full advantage of this. The Internet can be a wonderful source of information, but we need laws to protect us from cyber-fraud. Perhaps the members of Congress could work on legislation to address this when they get back from their vacation. CAROLE SHAPIRO Wayne, N.J., Aug. 10, 2014 To the Editor: I am an Episcopal priest, properly vetted and cleared to conduct hospital visits in Jacksonville, Fla. Recently, I was prevented from entering a pre-op area to pray with a patient before his procedure. I was there at the patient's request. A nurse told me that pre-op was an open bay, that only curtains separated the patients, and that I might overhear Hipaa-protected information. I was told, ''You should have prayed with him before he went to pre-op.'' This incident and your article about the banning of baby pictures at the doctor's office are examples of the unintended consequences of Hipaa, applied by people in fear and devoid of any imagination or common sense. (Canon) J. PERRY SMITH Jacksonville, Fla., Aug. 10, 2014 To the Editor: What bureaucratic nonsense that obstetricians and other doctors who deal with babies must take down bulletin boards of smiling-baby headshots, because the displays violate a neonate patient's privacy under the federal Hipaa law. While Hipaa may be well intentioned, more often than not it just gets in the way between doctors and patients. I know that it has added reams to paperwork; whenever I go to a new doctor, there are pages of boilerplate patient-rights-and-policy gobbledygook and unnecessary questionnaires. Now, Hipaa could really protect me if it prohibited doctors from snapping my digital photograph for their records, an increasingly common practice that leaves my likeness open to computer hacking along with everything else in my file. Besides, more doctors and hospitals are now insisting upon a photo ID, lest impostors try to stiff them. I don't have to show ID -- photo or otherwise -- to vote. Courts say that's discriminatory. Isn't it likewise discriminatory when doctors and hospitals ask sick people for a photo ID? BILL APPLE New York, Aug. 10, 2014 To the Editor: You report that federal privacy laws block doctors from posting pictures of patient babies where others can see them. Surely parents sending baby pictures to physicians do not expect the photos to be secret. The law should be amended to permit their posting, unless parents request that they be kept private. This is the type of regulation that fuels claims that government is the problem.

Heat System Called Door to Target for Hackers,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Investigators say they believe they have identified the entry point through which hackers got into Target's systems, zeroing in on the remote access granted through the retailer's computerized heating and cooling software, according to two people briefed on the inquiry. The latest revelation highlights the reality that a large company is actually a sprawling network of interconnected vendors, and that weak security at any one vendor can lead to a breach that costs hundreds of millions of dollars.  Target, Neiman Marcus and the Michaels chain of arts and crafts stores are among the major retailers whose systems have been hacked with what investigators suspect is similar malware that invades the computerized register system and snatches consumer data, according to people with knowledge of the investigations. But it has not been disclosed whether other companies were possibly invaded through outside vendors with remotely controlled access. Target had already confirmed that hackers used a vendor's stolen credentials to get inside its corporate network and crawl into a server containing 70 million customers' names, mailing addresses and email addresses and into the company's crown jewels: the in-store cash register systems that authorized 40 million customer's credit and debit cards over the course of a few weeks during the holiday shopping season last year. Using the vendor's access, hackers were able to burrow into Target's systems so thoroughly that even three days after Target thought it had expelled them, the retailer found malware on 25 registers, John J. Mulligan, Target's chief financial officer, testified at a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman, said the company would not comment on its vendors or specific details of the investigation. Brian Krebs, a security blogger who first reported the Target breach, was also the first on Wednesday to identify the vendor whose remote access had been compromised. But investigators would not confirm the vendor's identity. Security experts say that it is common for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning companies -- so-called HVAC companies -- to be granted network access to clients so that they can monitor retail stores and diagnose problems remotely. ''Remote access to these systems is really common and integrators are almost always on the corporate network,'' said Billy Rios, director of threat intelligence at Qualys, a cloud security firm. Mr. Rios said that the security at such companies tended to be poor and that vendors often used the same password across multiple customers. Over the last two years, Mr. Rios and Terry McCorkle, also of Qualys, said that they found 55,000 HVAC systems connected to the Internet. In most cases, they said, the systems contained basic security flaws that would allow hackers a way into companies' corporate networks, or the companies installing and monitoring these systems reused the same remote access passwords across multiple clients. The payment card industry's data security requirements dictate how employees, administrators and vendors can remotely connect to systems. They require that merchants like Target employ two-factor authentication -- which adds a second, temporary password during the login process -- for employees, administrators and vendors trying to gain entry to their systems remotely. Security specialists confirmed Wednesday that Target's heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems were connected to the Internet. But Target would not say whether its vendors were required to use two-factor authentication or to use virtual private network, or VPN, technology, which creates a private tunnel between employees and vendors working remotely and the company's private corporate network. The company has said, however, that it passed a security audit before its breach last November. Security experts advise companies to wrap additional digital security defenses around valuable assets, such as a company's intellectual property, or in Target's case, the cash register systems that process credit card payments. ''A lot of organizations don't know these systems are online,'' said Mr. McCorkle. ''They are truly designed to be bridges onto corporate networks.'' "
Computer Security Firm Raises $35 Million From K.K.R. and Others,"With the news of hacking and data theft dominating headlines, there would seem to be no better time for a security software provider to raise new money. And Ping Identity is wasting no time in collecting new funds. Ping, a 12-year-old company, said on Thursday that it had raised $35 million in a new round of funding, led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Ten Eleven Ventures, a venture capital firm founded by the security specialist Alex Doll.  Existing investors like Draper Fisher Jurvetson, General Catalyst Partners, SAP Ventures, W Capital Partners, Volition Capital, Triangle Peak Partners and Appian Ventures also participated.  The new money, which will bring Ping's total fund-raising efforts to $110 million, is meant to help the company grow as it seizes on a renewed focus on security. Its business is creating what the company's founder, Andre Durand, calls a universal identity for corporations in an age when employees increasingly use different devices and cloud-based applications, instead of simply logging onto a desktop at an office.  Using Ping, employees would to just log in once and then use their company's applications, rather than having to log into a corporate network and then their array of programs. That more centralized system - protected by what Mr. Durand called extra-tough security - makes life easier and more protected for customers. ""The Internet is becoming the center of the new work environment, not the corporate network,"" he said. ""The model of logging onto the corporate network is going away."" That has yielded significant growth over Ping's lifespan, Mr. Durand said. Its sales have grown on average about 50 percent a year, though he declined to provide more precise figures. It's a product offering that drew the attention of K.K.R., the investment giant best known for big leveraged buyouts like the takeovers of RJR Nabisco and the hospital operator HCA. But the firm has been dipping its toe more into the increasingly popular ""growth equity"" market, a somewhat nebulous term that encompasses investments in older, more established start-ups.  Several months ago, K.K.R. learned that Ping was looking to raise money with the assistance of the Royal Bank of Canada, and the firm's technology co-head, Herald Chen, began pursuing meetings with Mr. Durand. To help its cause, the investment firm enlisted Mr. Doll, a former chief executive of the software encryption company PGP. Over three months or so, the two sides began putting together what became the fund-raising round, with Mr. Chen and Mr. Doll agreeing to join Ping's board. ""It's pretty simple,"" Mr. Chen said. ""We have looked at a lot of investments in the growth area, and we think the Ping opportunity offers a great risk-reward proposition for K.K.R. We think it's a solid investment."" What K.K.R. will help bring to the table, according to both Mr. Chen and Mr. Doll, is its huge size and experience and contacts within the Fortune 100. (The firm's stable of portfolio companies will also use Ping products.)  Though Ping remains focused on growth, Mr. Durand added that the company is also keeping an eye on metrics befitting a more mature company, like profits and cash flow. Those measures will become increasingly important as the company heads toward what he said was ""independence"" - which includes a potential initial public offering within a few years' time. Mr. Durand said that a prospective I.P.O. has been discussed internally over the last year and a half, though such a move is likely to require ""a substantial company"" if it is to succeed in the public markets. The job now, he added, is to keep getting Ping to that point, especially while security remains a central focus for both customers and investors. ""Now is the time to seize the moment,"" he said.                       "
"The iPhone 6 Coming Soon to China, After Stern Look at Security","The Chinese government on Tuesday granted Apple the final license required to release the new iPhone 6 in mainland China, but the announcement came with a twist. The approval was good news for China's legions of Apple fans, who will be able to begin making preorders for the phone on Oct. 10, Apple said Tuesday. The phone first went on sale on Sept. 19 in the United States and a few other major markets, including Hong Kong, which operates under laws separate from those of mainland China.  Less encouraging for Apple, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced the approval on its website and, unusually, added a detailed description of security concerns that it had with Apple's iOS operating system. The ministry said it was worried about diagnostic tools that run on the iPhone that could compromise users' private data when the users connect their phones to computers or when they take the phones to repair shops to be fixed. The statement did not mention new encryption functions on the iPhone 6 that are intended to make gaining access to data time-consuming and difficult without the consent of the user. ""What the ministry tests to give this license has nothing to do with the warnings they included about these holes in security,"" said Wang Yanhui, secretary of the China Mobile Alliance, a semiofficial organization that facilitates communication between the Chinese government and mobile phone companies in China. The ministry said on its website that after it presented the concerns to Apple, the company provided it with ""official materials"" to address them. The ministry said that Apple had shown that the company cannot gain access to customer data without approval from the customer, that the new iOS 8 operating system is more resistant to attempts to steal customer data using diagnostic tools and that Apple had never provided a backdoor to give data to any government agency. ""If companies are found to violate personal information protection policies, the ministry will investigate and take care of the problem according to relevant laws and regulations,"" the ministry said. In a statement issued this month, Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said the company had never cooperated with the government of any country to provide access to customer data. All smartphones have certain functions that can make them vulnerable when on the Internet, Mr. Wang said. He added, without elaborating, that he believed there was a level of ""intentionality"" in the inclusion of the remarks about safety. The Chinese government has hinted strongly over the past year that it will take steps to decrease its reliance on foreign technology after disclosures by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden about surveillance by the United States government. At a conference in September, Wei Jianguo, the director general of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said that the Shanghai municipal government had told its employees to use phones made by the Chinese company Huawei instead of ones from Apple or Samsung, according to a transcript posted on the online news portal Sohu, one of the sponsors of the event. Three city and central government officials, who requested anonymity because they feared reprisals, said they had not heard of such a policy, but analysts have said the central government could eventually take steps to ensure that officials use phones made by domestic companies.

Target Executive Resigns After Breach,"The highest-ranking technology executive at Target has resigned, the company said on Wednesday, just one week after it revealed how badly its profits had been hurt during the holiday season by an enormous breach of its system that exposed customer information. Beth M. Jacob, who held the title of chief information officer and executive vice president for technology services, is the first high-level executive to depart after a series of computer hacking episodes that may have also affected more than half a dozen other retailers in recent months.  The company said it would name an interim information officer from outside the company while it searched for Ms. Jacob's replacement, in what Gregg Steinhafel, Target's chief executive, described as an ''overhaul'' of how the company protects sensitive information. ''While we are still in the process of an ongoing investigation, we recognize that the information security environment is evolving rapidly,'' Mr. Steinhafel said. In her resignation letter, Ms. Jacob said she was stepping down ''effective immediately,'' but she made no mention of the data breach. ''This is a difficult decision after 12 rewarding years with the company I love,'' she said. ''But this is a good time for a change.'' While it is unclear how involved Ms. Jacob was in day-to-day protection, online security officials at the company ultimately reported to her. Target has declined to provide details on her training, but according to the Target website, Ms. Jacob does not appear to have a computer science background. She holds a degree in retail merchandising and a master's in business administration. She first joined Target in 1984 as an assistant buyer, left the company for a time and then returned in 2002 to run its call centers. She had been vice president of Target Technology Services and chief information officer since 2008. Target also said on Wednesday that it would create a high-level position to focus on web security. A company spokeswoman said the responsibility had been shared by several people in the past, and would now be centralized. On Dec. 19, during the final days of the holiday shopping season, the company publicly confirmed that credit and debit card information for 40 million of its customers had been compromised. A few weeks later, the company announced that another batch of data, personal information on some 70 million customers, had been stolen as well. The breach at Target was believed to have been perpetrated by a group of criminals in Eastern Europe who installed malware on the company's system to siphon away customer information, according to two people involved in the investigation who were not authorized to speak publicly. One law enforcement official said the criminals were believed to have gained access to Target's system using the login credentials of one of the retailer's vendors, a company based in Pennsylvania that provided air-conditioning, heating and refrigeration services. Since the Target breach became public, several other retailers have acknowledged the theft of customer information, including Neiman Marcus and Michaels arts and craft stores. On Wednesday, Sally Beauty, which sells beauty products at 2,600 stores throughout the United States, said it was investigating a possible breach. The breaches at Target, Neiman and Michaels are believed to have been perpetrated by the same group of criminals, who targeted as many as six other retailers. But so far, the Target breach appears to have affected the most people. For Target, news of the breach could not have surfaced at a worse time, and it had a significant impact on its performance during the all-important holiday season. Last week, Target said that its fourth-quarter profit was down 46 percent from the same period the year before, partly because of a steep drop in sales and traffic after the breach became public. To lure back jittery shoppers, Target was forced to offer unplanned discounts, like 10 percent off purchases in its stores during the last weekend before Christmas, which also took a bite out of its profit. The company spent $61 million on expenses related to the breach during the fourth quarter, and said it expected to receive $44 million in insurance payments. Hemu Nigam, founder of SSP Blue, a security consulting firm that also does corporate reputation development, said Ms. Jacob's departure was an important step for Target in rebuilding both its image and its approach to security. ''When Wall Street and your consumers are so significantly impacted by an event like this, you have to do what people expect, which is to make significant changes,'' Mr. Nigam said. In the past, Target has been fond of hiring internally, but on Wednesday it announced a third external search, for a new chief compliance officer. Ann Scovil, who oversees compliance and risk assurance at the company, will retire at the end of the month, a spokeswoman said, and her position will be split between two people. Mr. Nigam said that understanding and defending against online attacks required a particular skill set. ''I think what Target is showcasing is that the time has come to focus energy and resources in that unique space,'' he said. ''It's the only way for businesses to thrive in the future.'' "
"Secret Service Warns 1,000 Businesses on Hack That Affected Target","More than 1,000 American businesses have been affected by the cyberattack that hit the in-store cash register systems at Target, Supervalu and most recently UPS Stores.  The attacks are much more pervasive than previously reported, and hackers are pilfering the data of millions of payment cards from American consumers without companies knowing about it, according to a new Department of Homeland Security advisory released Friday afternoon.  On July 31, Homeland Security along with the Secret Service, the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center and their partners in the security industry warned companies to check their in-store cash register systems for malware, which security experts dubbed ""Backoff"" after a word that appeared in its code. Until that point, Backoff malware and variations of it were undetectable by anti-virus products. Since then, seven companies that sell and manage in-store cash register systems confirmed to government officials that they each have had multiple clients affected. Some, like UPS and Supervalu, have stepped forward but the vast majority have not Altogether, the Secret Service estimates that more than 1,000 American businesses have been affected. According to the Secret Service, criminals are actively scanning corporate systems for remote access opportunities - a vendor with remote access to a company's systems or employees with the ability to work remotely - and then deploying computers to high-speed guess usernames and passwords until they've hit the right combination. The hackers use those footholds to crawl through corporate networks until they gain access to the in-store cash register systems. From there, criminals are scraping payment card data off the cash register systems and sending it back, through various hop points, to their servers abroad. Millions of American consumers' payment card details are being sold on the black market, many of them from American companies that do not know their systems have been breached. Unless companies search for Backoff on their systems, it can be difficult to identify. The Homeland Security report to be released later Friday recommends companies contact their service providers, antivirus vendors and cash register system vendor to assess whether they've been compromised, or are vulnerable to attack.   In a July 31 advisory, the Secret Service and Homeland Security recommended that companies limit the number of vendors with access to their internal network; require long, complex passwords that cannot easily be cracked by a computer, and lock employees and vendors out of their accounts after multiple login requests. The agencies recommended that companies segregate crucial systems, like their cash registers, from corporate networks and install so-called two-factor authentication, which is a method that forces employees to enter a second, one-time password in addition to their usual credentials. They also suggested that companies encrypt customer's data from the moment their cards are swiped in the store, log all network activity, and deploy security software that can alert technicians to unusual activity, like a cash register in a UPS Store in Tennessee communicating with a server in Russia.

Hackers Breach Security of a Health Exchange Server,"WASHINGTON -- Hackers breached security at the website of the government's health insurance marketplace, HealthCare.gov, but did not steal any personal information on consumers, Obama administration officials said Thursday.  The administration informed Congress of the violation, which it described as ''an intrusion on a test server'' supporting the website. ''Our review indicates that the server did not contain consumer personal information, data was not transmitted outside the agency and the website was not specifically targeted,'' said Aaron Albright, a spokesman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the website. ''We have taken measures to further strengthen security.'' Mr. Albright said the hacking was made possible by several security weaknesses. The test server should not have been connected to the Internet, he said, and it came from the manufacturer with a default password that had not been changed. In addition, he said, the server was not subject to regular security scans as it should have been. The security of HealthCare.gov, which serves residents of 36 states, has been a major concern for some members of Congress, particularly Republicans. Congressional investigators found that administration officials, eager to begin enrollment on Oct. 1, activated the website even though its security had not been fully tested and did not meet federal standards. This created a potentially ''high risk'' for the exchange, according to a memorandum prepared by security experts at the Medicare agency. Since then, administration officials have repeatedly reassured consumers that the problems were fixed. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said Thursday that the intrusion into HealthCare.gov ''should come as a surprise to no one.'' ''Despite numerous warnings from myself and other lawmakers that security breaches were possible, HealthCare.gov underwent virtually no independent security testing'' before it went live, Mr. Hatch said. The attack was noticed by federal employees on Aug. 25. Hackers downloaded malicious software onto a test server of HealthCare.gov as part of a broader denial-of-service attack, intended to cripple other websites. In such an attack, hackers infect hundreds or thousands of computers, called botnets, with malware and then command those computers to send traffic to a particular website in an effort to push it offline. For months, cybersecurity professionals have been warning that the health care site was a ripe target for hackers eager to gain access to personal data that could be sold on the black market. A week before federal officials discovered the breach at HealthCare.gov, a hospital operator in Tennessee said that Chinese hackers had stolen personal data for 4.5 million patients. ''This was a botnet exploit, but you can be assured that had this been a more targeted attack, it would have been much more successful, stealthy and effective,'' said Wayne Jackson, the chief executive of Sonatype, a software security firm.

"Apple Says iOS 8 Update Keeps Data Private, Even From the Police","Apple wants to make clear that it wants nobody snooping around in your device, not even the police. The company said Wednesday night that its latest software system, iOS 8, included deep protection of the information stored on Apple mobile devices. So deep, in fact, that Apple says it has become technically impossible for it to comply with government warrants asking for customer information like photos, email, messages, contacts, call history and notes, to be extracted from devices.   The company said all this information was under the protection of a customer's passcode, the four-digit number used to log in to the device. In the past, Apple was able to extract certain types of information from devices, even when they were locked with a passcode, in response to a valid search warrant.  The new security in iOS 8 protects information stored on the device itself, but not data stored on Apple's cloud service. So Apple will still be able to hand over some customer information stored on iCloud in response to government requests. Apple announced the revised privacy policy on its new privacy webpage, apple.com/privacy, which included a letter written by Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief. ""Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data,"" the company said on the new webpage. ""So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8."" Chris Soghoian, a principal analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union, said Apple's new privacy policy reflected the revelations of the government surveillance programs revealed in documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden. ""The public has said they want companies to put their privacy first, and Apple has listened,"" Mr. Soghoian said.  The new webpage includes explanations of what types of information Apple does and does not collect, and why. It also lists Apple's latest so-called transparency reports, which break down how, when and why it handles requests from law enforcement or government agencies seeking information about customers. In addition, the webpage teaches consumers how to turn on important security features, like two-step verification, to protect themselves from hackers. In his letter, Mr. Cook emphasized that Apple was unlike other Internet companies that benefit from collecting customer data and sharing it with third parties, like advertisers. ""Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products,"" he said. ""We don't build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers."" Apple's ability to protect customer information was openly questioned after a number of celebrities discovered that hackers broke into their Apple accounts, stole nude or provocative photos, and posted those photos on the Internet.  After that episode, Mr. Cook said the company would strengthen some security measures for iCloud, and work harder to educate consumers on protecting their accounts. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the statements in Mr. Cook's letter. "
Acquisition Combines 2 Darlings Of Security,"SAN FRANCISCO -- In a deal that may have broad repercussions for companies and governments fending off sophisticated hackers and state-sponsored digital attacks, FireEye, a provider of security software, has acquired Mandiant, a company known for emergency responses to computer network breaches. The deal, in both cash and stock, is worth more than $1 billion, based on the current value of shares in FireEye.  The acquisition, which closed on Monday but was not publicly announced until after the markets closed on Thursday, was one of the biggest security deals of 2013. It merges two darlings in the $67 billion global computer security market that together could form a formidable competitor to antivirus giants like Symantec and Intel's McAfee. David G. DeWalt, FireEye's chairman and chief executive, ran McAfee before it was sold to Intel in 2010. Mr. DeWalt was rumored to be a contender for the top job at Intel, but surprised company insiders when he left to join FireEye in 2012. Mandiant is best known for sending in emergency teams to root out attackers who have implanted software into corporate computer systems. Much of its work focused on attacks from China, and last year it made headlines with a detailed study of a hacking group known as ''Comment Crew'' that provided the strongest evidence yet that the hackers were closely linked to a unit of China's People's Liberation Army, outside Shanghai. The combination of the two companies -- one that detects attacks in a novel way, another that responds to attacks -- comes as corporate America has become wary of relying on the federal government to monitor the Internet and warn of incoming attacks. That wariness has increased since the revelations of Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who removed thousands of documents before he took temporary refuge in Moscow. The documents have made it evident to companies that the United States monitors allies as well as adversaries, including friendly governments, international organizations and the networks of some Internet companies. Some could turn to companies like FireEye and Mandiant for protection, an interesting twist since many of Mandiant's employees come from the American intelligence world. ''After the Snowden events, in the current political climate, no one can say to the government, 'Please, come on in and monitor our networks,' '' said Kevin Mandia, the founder of Mandiant who will become chief operating officer of the combined company. Mandiant is privately held, and the big winners in the acquisition will be Mr. Mandia, the company's founder, Mr. DeWalt, who joined Mandiant's board as chairman in 2012, and the company's venture backers. Mandiant has raised $70 million from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm, and One Equity Partners, an investment arm of JPMorgan Chase. FireEye's success so far has depended on a technology for detecting attacks that works quite differently from most antivirus products. Most products monitor the web and identify malicious software that has already begun to hit victims around the world. But by the time the attack has been identified and blocked, the malicious software has already had a chance to do damage -- siphoning a company's trade secrets, erasing data or emptying a customer's bank account. FireEye's software isolates incoming traffic in virtual containers and looks for suspicious activity in a sort of virtual petri dish before deciding whether to let the traffic through. ''Companies are spending tens of billions of dollars of their money on a model that doesn't work,'' Mr. DeWalt said. ''It's going to take people and products working together.'' Mandiant was frequently called in after FireEye found malware. In those cases, it used its own threat detection technology to determine where the attack was coming from and to design countermeasures. In an interview, Mr. Mandia and Mr. DeWalt said the combined company would be able to notify its customers as soon as it detected abnormal behavior, execute a temporary fix and then dispatch a Mandiant team to take further steps. It will also give Mandiant more reach: FireEye works with more than a thousand customers, including 40 state military operations, around the globe. Mandiant had $100 million in revenue in 2012, up more than 76 percent from the previous year. Mandiant responded to attacks by Chinese hackers at The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal last year. About 95 percent of its business is domestic and it was just beginning to develop an international presence. In April 2012, the companies began teaming up on various product initiatives. In February, they began integrating FireEye's software with Mandiant's threat detection products after seeing that many of their customers were already deploying their products and services together. Then, a few months ago, the two chief executives started discussing a deal. On Monday, the boards of both companies agreed to terms in which FireEye will pay Mandiant shareholders $106.5 million in cash and 21.5 million shares and options. Under the deal terms, Mandiant will become an operating subsidiary of FireEye, and Mr. Mandia will oversee FireEye's services, cloud and endpoint security operations. Mr. Mandia said that before initiating acquisition talks, he had considered taking Mandiant public. He said he began to warm to the idea of an acquisition in the last few months, when he saw that FireEye's detection products would be a ''natural fit'' for Mandiant's expertise in responding to breaches. The market has already shown an enthusiasm for FireEye's products. Since the company made its debut on the Nasdaq in September, its stock price has more than doubled. That has made it the most successful initial public offering of a security company in 2013 and a big gain for FireEye's founder, Ashar Aziz, a former Sun Microsystems engineer who started the company in 2004, and FireEye's venture capital backers like Norwest, Sequoia Capital and In-Q-Tel, the venture arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, and others. FireEye now has a $5 billion market capitalization, though it has yet to turn a profit. On Thursday, when the company announced the Mandiant acquisition, it also announced that it had exceeded its fourth-quarter revenue guidance. The company said it anticipated total revenue for 2013 to be $159 million to $161 million, compared with previous guidance of $156 million to $158 million. The guidance, and news of the merger, sent FireEye's stock up 22.5 percent in after-hours trading. "
Target Missed Signs of a Data Breach,"Target acknowledged on Thursday that its computer security system had alerted it to suspicious activity after hackers infiltrated its network last year, but the company ultimately decided to ignore it, allowing what would become one of the largest data breaches ever recorded to proceed without a hitch.  ''With the benefit of hindsight, we are investigating whether, if different judgments had been made, the outcome may have been different,'' Molly Snyder, a spokeswoman for Target, said in a statement. Before the attack, Target installed security software designed by FireEye, a security firm based in Milpitas, Calif., according to two researchers who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing client confidentiality. FireEye's software, as it turns out, worked as designed. It isolates incoming web traffic and looks for suspicious activity. In Target's case, the software sounded multiple alarms as criminals uploaded tools to siphon out customers' credit and personal data. ''Like any large company, each week at Target there are a vast number of technical events that take place and are logged,'' Ms. Snyder said. ''Through our investigation, we learned that after these criminals entered our network, a small amount of their activity was logged and surfaced to our team. That activity was evaluated and acted upon. ''Based on their interpretation and evaluation of that activity, the team determined that it did not warrant immediate follow-up,'' she said. On Dec. 19, in the final days of the holiday shopping season, Target confirmed publicly that credit and debit card information for 40 million of its customers had been compromised. A few weeks later, the company said an additional trove of personal information, like email and mailing addresses, from some 70 million people had been exposed as well. The company has said that when the news became public, its traffic and sales took an immediate and substantive hit, from which it has yet to fully recover. The company spent $61 million related to the breach in the fourth quarter, and executives have said they expect those charges to continue. The security alerts were first reported by Bloomberg Businessweek. Since the data theft at Target became public, several other retailers have acknowledged breaches of their own, including Neiman Marcus and the arts and crafts store Michaels. Those two breaches are believed to have come from the same Eastern European group that attacked Target, and may have attacked as many as six other retailers. Last week, Beth M. Jacob, Target's most senior technology executive, resigned from the company in what appeared to be a response to the breach and the company's continuing investigation. She was the first high-level executive to leave after the attacks. "
Target Gives a Defense of Its Efforts on Security,"In advance of next week's annual shareholders' meeting, Target on Monday defended its management and oversight of customer data despite the extensive hacking it experienced last year.  In a letter to shareholders filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Roxanne Austin, the interim chairwoman of Target's board, listed steps the company had taken toward increasing information security since the breach last year, and she described the security apparatus in place before the attack. ''Breaches are occurring across the economy and are affecting a wide range of victims including the U.S. government, the technology and defense industries and more traditional companies, like retailers,'' the letter said. ''Your board fully recognizes the importance of its oversight responsibilities in this area. Under the board's leadership and oversight, Target took significant action to address evolving cybercrime risks before the breach.'' Last week, an influential shareholder advisory group, Institutional Shareholder Services, said that the majority of Target's directors did not deserve to be re-elected because they had not provided sufficient risk oversight before the breach. I.S.S. recommended that shareholders vote against seven of the 10 board members, including Ms. Austin. Before the breach, which exposed the data of tens of millions of Target customers, the company spent hundreds of millions of dollars on network security in areas like technology and personnel and had a staff of more than 300 information security employees, Ms. Austin said. That was double the staff it had in that area five years ago. It also required data security training for all employees every year and had a security operations center staffed at all hours to keep an eye out for suspicious activity, among other measures. Many information security experts, however, have said the company did not have certain important safeguards measures in place. And in March, the retailer acknowledged that its computer system had sent out alerts of suspicious activity during the breach, but that those warnings were ultimately ignored. Ms. Austin's letter also highlighted steps the company had taken in response since the breach was revealed in December, including accelerating its conversion to a more secure payment-card technology on its branded cards and in its stores and hiring a new chief information officer. The letter did not address other significant personnel changes made at the company in recent months, including the resignation of the chief executive, Gregg Steinhafel. A search is underway for his replacement. The chief information officer at the time of the breach, Beth M. Jacob, resigned as well. "
"Chinese Hackers Extending Reach to Smaller U.S. Agencies, Officials Say","WASHINGTON -- After years of cyberattacks on the networks of high-profile government targets like the Pentagon, Chinese hackers appear to have turned their attention to far more obscure federal agencies. Law enforcement and cybersecurity analysts in March detected intrusions on the computer networks of the Government Printing Office and the Government Accountability Office, senior American officials said this week. The printing office catalogs and publishes information for the White House, Congress and many federal departments and agencies. It also prints passports for the State Department. The accountability office, known as the congressional watchdog, investigates federal spending and the effectiveness of government programs.  The attacks occurred around the same time Chinese hackers breached the networks of the Office of Personnel Management, which houses the personal information of all federal employees and more detailed information on tens of thousands of employees who have applied for top-secret security clearances. Some of those networks were so out of date that the hackers seemed confused about how to navigate them, officials said. But the intrusions puzzled American officials because hackers have usually targeted offices that have far more classified information. It is not clear whether the hackers were operating on behalf of the Chinese government. But the sophisticated nature of the attacks has led some American officials to believe that the government, which often conducts cyberattacks through the military or proxies, played a role. Shawn Henry, an executive at the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and a former top F.B.I. cybersecurity official, said the attacks were ''indicative of a state-run intelligence agency'' because that is one of the few groups that would want such information. Mr. Henry said that foreign intelligence agencies spent a fair amount of time trying to break into heavily protected networks with troves of secret information. But hackers will also open the doors of obscure agencies just to see what they may have. ''Along the way you're going to shake a lot of doorknobs,'' he said. ''You may not spend a lot of time in that place, but if the door is unlocked, why not look in?'' Government networks are attacked nearly every day, but the intruders are rarely successful. The breaches in March were significant enough that F.B.I. agents in Washington have opened an investigation into the attacks, which the agents say they believe are connected. James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that it made sense for foreign hackers to target the networks of the accountability office and the personnel office, but that the printing office was curious. ''G.A.O. looks at military, intelligence and economic programs, and you would want to see the information they have that hasn't been made public, like their notes,'' he said. ''O.P.M. has all the information on security clearances, and who is applying for them.'' ''But was G.P.O. a mistake?'' Mr. Lewis said. ''Is it just them not understanding how things work or not understanding what it stands for? They could have found a way in, and these were the agencies that came up. This is some guy sitting in an office in China who doesn't have a sophisticated understanding of how the U.S. government works and doesn't have a lot of direction.'' The attacks occurred at a time when cybersecurity disputes between the United States and China have grown more contentious, with each side accusing the other of unethical, if not criminal, behavior. In May, the Justice Department unsealed an indictment that charged five hackers who worked for the People's Liberation Army with stealing corporate secrets, in an attempt to deter the Chinese from attacks on American corporations. The Chinese have countered by saying that the Obama administration was hypocritical. Citing disclosures from Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, China said the N.S.A. had gone deep into the computer systems of Huawei, a Chinese company that makes computer network equipment, and had spied on Chinese military and political leaders. The accountability office and the printing office said in statements that the hackers had not able been to get their hands on any personal identification information. But the accountability office said that it had been forced to remove several servers that had been infected in the attacks, and that it had taken ''additional steps to strengthen the security'' of its system. With help from the Department of Homeland Security and outside specialists, the agency said it analyzed ''the extent of the malware'' that was embedded during the attacks and eradicated it. The agency said in the statement that it had scanned all of its servers and work stations and had found no evidence ''that any audit records, federal agency records or personally identifiable information'' had been removed. ''In fact,'' it added, ''servers with information on our audit work and report drafts did not have malware, and classified and other sensitive data work stations are not connected to our network.'' The accountability office played down the significance of the attack on its system, saying ''this effort to gain access'' was not surprising because federal agencies reported 9,883 malware attacks in the 2013 fiscal year. Mr. Lewis said he believed that the office's release of the figure on the number of malware attacks on federal agencies was one of the first times the federal government had disclosed such information. That number is difficult to assess, he said, because it is unclear how many of those attacks resulted in intrusions. The accountability office declined to say how often it sustained such attacks, and cybersecurity experts said that only some malware attacks led to an F.B.I. investigation. ''We're not going to get into a history of how many times we have or have not been attacked,'' said Charles Young, a spokesman for the agency. The printing office said only that it had recently been ''notified of a potential intrusion of our network,'' adding that it had ''responded immediately to mitigate risks and ensure the security of our systems.'' Because labor is inexpensive in China, there are many hackers. They often break into whatever they can and move on to their next target if they do not find anything that interests them. ''Everyone moans about the N.S.A., but people don't realize the Chinese are doing the same things to us,'' Mr. Lewis said. "
Apple Issues Fix for Security Problem on Macs,"Apple has finally issued a security update to its OS X Mavericks software for Macintosh computers, patching a bug that could have let hackers eavesdrop on supposedly encrypted connections and steal everything from usernames and passwords to location data.  Version 10.9.2 comes four days after Apple patched iOS, its mobile operating system, to close the same hole. The OS X update addresses several security issues, including the so-called ""goto fail"" code bug, which Apple said could allow an attacker to capture or modify data in sessions users believe are protected by the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transportation Layer Security (TLS) encryption methods. The flaw is extremely serious, and any Mavericks users who haven't yet updated their OS should do so immediately. In a nutshell, the bug prevents the validation of encryption certificates from supposedly secure servers. So, your Mac or iOS device could think it has received a signed encryption certificate from your bank's website, but there's no way to validate that the certificate came from the bank - it could be from a fraudulent website pretending to be the bank and gathering personal data as you type.   The errant code affected Apple's Safari browser as well as iCloud, the Mail email client and any other applications created by Apple, because the company uses its own implementation of SSL/TLS. Since the flaw became public on Friday, when Apple issued its update to iOS, security researchers have been demanding updates to OS X Mavericks.  It's unknown whether active exploits were created, but a New Zealand security researcher reported today that he wrote a proof-of-concept program that successfully captured supposedly secure data on unpatched iOS and OS X devices. ""Nearly all encrypted traffic, including usernames, passwords and even Apple app updates can be captured,"" Aldo Cortesi, of the security consulting firm Nullcube, wrote on his blog. ""It's difficult to overstate the seriousness of this issue."" It's also unclear how long the bug has been in OS X and iOS. It seems to have appeared in OS X with the release of version 10.9 in October 2013, but it existed in iOS as far back as version 6, released in September 2012. A Google engineer named Adam Langley was one of the first to write up the specifics of the ""gotofail"" bug and noted that ""this sort of subtle bug deep in the code is a nightmare. I believe that it's just a mistake, and I feel very bad for whoever might have slipped in an editor and created it.""   No doubt, there will and should be questions over the next few days about how and when Apple became aware of the bug, why it wasn't caught and why it took so long to release a fix for OS X. Since the flaw became public on Friday and in Apple's own published source code before that, it's safe to assume that millions of users could have been exposed to ""man in the middle"" attacks that compromised email, usernames, passwords, calendar updates and even location data. So if you haven't already updated your iOS devices and your Macs, you've got some patching to do - and so do I.   "
Smartwatches and Weak Privacy Rules,"Even before Apple announced a smartwatch that can measure someone's heart rate and the number of steps climbed in a day, wearable devices and mobile apps that log your every move and vital sign were growing in popularity. Apple's size and influence as a trendsetter has now focused attention on the privacy implications of these machines and software.  It's true that the devices could help some people lead healthier lives. The problem is that most of the medical and personal information collected by fitness trackers and apps is not protected by federal privacy laws. Beyond making promises, there is little to keep Apple and other businesses from using the information as they see fit. The firms that collect the data can bombard you with ads for sneakers or nutritional supplements, or sell it to data brokers that have already assembled detailed dossiers on millions of Americans, including their employment histories, shopping habits, Internet browsing patterns and medical conditions. Some of the information can be very sensitive. Employers, for instance, might discover from data collected from fitness devices that an employee, or prospective employee, is struggling to lose weight. Such information is not protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which mainly covers medical records at doctors' offices, hospitals and other health care providers. The Federal Drug Administration regulates the use of fitness devices and apps, but it appears to be largely concerned about their safety and effectiveness, not privacy. The Federal Trade Commission recently tested 12 fitness apps and found that they transmitted personal information, workout habits and other data to 76 different entities. The agency did not describe these entities, but some of them are probably marketers and advertisers. ''We don't know where that information ultimately goes,'' Julie Brill, an F.T.C. commissioner, said recently. Privacy advocates say Apple appears to be taking steps to protect the health data collected by its phones and the Apple Watch, which is expected to go on sale next year. The company has told developers that design and build apps that they cannot use such data for advertising and won't let them store the information in Apple's cloud computing service, the security of which has recently been called into question by the hacking of the cloud accounts of celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence. Apple says app developers, which could include companies like Nike, must also obtain the consent of their users before sharing health information with third parties like Facebook, which would also be forbidden from using the information for marketing purposes. Apple's policies seem well intentioned, but the company will need to monitor app developers closely to make sure they are following the rules and remove them from its app store if they do not. No amount of caution can truly take the place of strong privacy laws that give consumers control over what kinds of data companies collect about them and what businesses can do with it, something President Obama called for in 2012. Federal lawmakers have not passed such legislation, in large part because businesses that collect and use private data for targeted marketing have lobbied aggressively to preserve the status quo. The country should welcome innovative health devices but should also make sure that they do not becomes tools to invade individual privacy. "
Unto the Breach,"Charles M. Blow is off today. On Wednesday, a letter landed in my email inbox from Gregg Steinhafel, the chief executive of Target. He wanted me to know that there was a decent likelihood that some of my personal information had been stolen by criminals who had ''forced their way into our systems,'' as Steinhafel put it, and pulled off one of the biggest data breaches in history. I'm not a regular Target shopper, so I had to think about this for a minute. Then I remembered: In mid-December, while marooned in Houston after missing a connecting flight to Rio de Janeiro, I went to a Target store to buy some clean clothes. I paid with my debit card, which I swiped through the little ''point of sale'' machine, and then entered my passcode -- something I probably do a dozen times a day. The very ordinariness of the transaction is partly why it hadn't stood out in my memory.  Since receiving Steinhafel's letter, however, I've been brushing up on data breaches, and I'm here to say it is going to be a while before I'm sanguine when I make that little swiping motion with my debit card. In the battle between hackers and retailers, it sure looks as though the hackers are winning. If you have read anything about the Target data breach, you know that from Nov. 27 to mid-December, hackers siphoned off the credit card information of 40 million Target shoppers, including card numbers, passcodes and the three-digit security code on the back. They also took names and email addresses of tens of millions of other Target customers. Target acknowledged the breach on Dec. 19, but only after a reporter named Brian Krebs had broken the news on his authoritative blog, Krebs on Security. When I talked to Krebs, he told me that while Target was ''hardly a poster boy for how to secure data,'' the company probably wasn't all that much worse than most other retailers. Its digital system undoubtedly had all the current antivirus software, none of which had detected the malicious software -- ''malware,'' as it's called -- that had infected it. Krebs was pretty convinced that the hackers were Russians. It was obvious that they were extremely sophisticated in how they went about stealing credit card data. After burrowing into a Target server, he explained on his blog, the malware would then grab data from Target's point-of-sale terminals all across the country shortly after customers swiped their cards. At that moment, a moment of maximum vulnerability since all the data was unencrypted at that point, the magnetic stripe would yield all the information the hacker needed. Another security expert, Gerhard Eschelbeck, the chief technology officer at Sophos, wrote in a recent report that ''one trend that stands out is the growing ability of malware authors to camouflage their attacks.'' Eschelbeck described attacks by modern hacks as ''innovative and diverse.'' Virtually every security expert I spoke to said it is likely that a lot more retail companies have been breached than has been acknowledged. Indeed, last week, Neiman Marcus admitted that its systems had been breached. And just the other day, the Department of Homeland Security sent a report to retailers and banks warning about point-of-sale malware, which it suspects has infected more systems than just Target's. So why don't retailers do more to stop such attacks? Part of the reason is that nobody is forcing them to. It costs a lot of money to completely revamp their systems in ways that would make them harder to breach. However disruptive to customers, there really hadn't been any business consequences, not until the Target breach, anyway. (Target saw its Christmas sales decline after the breach was announced.) The simplest thing we could do to diminish data breaches would be to move away from magnetic stripes, which are relatively easy to copy, and go to a system in which credit and debit cards are embedded with chips. In widespread use in Europe and elsewhere, such cards are practically nonexistent in the United States (though a rollout is supposed to begin in the fall of 2015). In 2009, a payment company called Heartland suffered a breach that was even larger than Target's. You would think that would have been a wake-up call, but apparently it wasn't. The most galling part of Steinhafel's letter is its advice to consumers. ''Never share information with anyone,'' he writes. ''Be wary of emails that ask for money.'' None of this advice, of course, would have helped anyone who had the misfortune to shop at Target during the three weeks the malware was doing its devious work. The fault was not ours, Mr. Steinhafel; it was yours. As for me, it turns out that the Russian hackers won't be able to use my debit card information after all. I had to get a new card -- after I was hacked in Brazil. "
"Target Had Chance to Stop Breach, Senators Say","WASHINGTON -- Two Democratic senators on Wednesday criticized Target's management for not stopping a huge data breach of its systems, citing several missed opportunities to thwart the attack and protect customer data. Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said at a hearing that the hacking last year of Target, one of the nation's largest retailers, ''must be a clarion call to businesses, both large and small, that it's time to invest in some changes.'' Senators Rockefeller and Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said that Target's failure to heed warning signs of incursions by cybercriminals ultimately was the fault of its top executives.  ''The best technology in the world is useless unless there's good management,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''And here, to be quite blunt, there were multiple warnings from the company's anti-intrusion software; they were missed by management.'' John J. Mulligan, the chief financial officer of Target, told the committee that the company was fortifying its security systems. Mr. Mulligan and other witnesses said they supported heightened federal regulations, including uniform standards on breach notifications, which are now governed by a mix of state laws. Mr. Mulligan, who began and ended his testimony with effusive apologies for the breach, outlined steps by company to improve data security, including strengthening authentication requirements and narrowing access to its systems. ''We know this has shaken their confidence, and we intend to earn it back,'' Mr. Mulligan said of Target's customers. ''Like you, we are asking hard questions about whether we could have taken different actions before the breach was discovered that would have resulted in different outcomes.'' The breach at Target exposed payment card information of 40 million people and personal information, like phone numbers and email addresses, of 70 million people, making it one of the largest breaches in corporate history. Target has said it believes there is an overlap of at least 12 million people between the groups. Since Target acknowledged the breach last December, similar incidents have been disclosed by other retailers, including Neiman Marcus and Michaels, a chain of arts and craft stores. One loose band of online criminals is believed to be culpable for many of these crimes, but no arrests have been made. A Commerce Committee's staff report said Target may have missed several chances to head off the attack, including by not responding to warning signs from its malware detection systems and not establishing more robust protections against suspicious activities, which could have raised red flags when data was uploaded to a server in Russia, for example. Also testifying at the hearing was Peter J. Beshar, the general counsel of Marsh & McLennan, who spoke about insurance against data breaches. In an earnings report last month, Target said that it spent $61 million in the fourth quarter on data breach expenses, before taxes, and expected to receive $44 million in insurance payments. Target executives have predicted those costs will continue. Several Democratic senators are backing a bill that would give the Federal Trade Commission oversight authority to regulate data security standards and require breached companies to notify affected consumers. Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, pressed Mr. Mulligan and Ellen Richey, the chief enterprise risk officer at Visa, unsuccessfully for estimates of how much fraud had resulted from the data breach at Target, and asked which institutions would end up ''holding the bag.'' Senator McCaskill said ''the bag'' would largely fall in the laps of credit unions and local banks, rather than those of companies like Target and Visa. ''I think it is confusing to the consuming public where this loss falls and where the costs are absorbed,'' she said. ''I think it's very important that the risk be borne by those who must engage in the activity to protect.'' Early this month, Beth M. Jacob, Target's senior technology executive, resigned. She was the first senior executive to step down in the wake of the breach. Representatives from Snapchat, an app that allows users to send videos and pictures that are quickly deleted, declined an invitation to testify at the hearing, Senator Rockefeller said. In January, a group of security researchers announced they had hacked into Snapchat. "
"Malwarebytes, an Antivirus Start-Up, Raises $30 Million","Marcin Kleczynski didn't want the money. It was February 2013, and Mr. Kleczynski, the chief executive of an antivirus start-up called Malwarebytes, had received a cold call from a venture capitalist hoping to discuss a possible investment. But Malwarebytes, which started in 2008, was already making enough profit to sustain itself.  Now, a little more than a year later, Mr. Kleczynski has accepted the check. Malwarebytes announced on Thursday a $30 million investment from Highland Capital Partners, the same firm that tried to get in the door in 2013. It is the first outside capital Malwarebytes has raised. The investment shows investors' continued hunger for antivirus and cybersecurity products, which are increasingly in demand as cybercriminals devise more sophisticated methods. The stock of one prominent cybersecurity firm, FireEye, closed on Wednesday at $34.20 a share, 71 percent above its initial public offering price in September, though far below a high of almost $96 that it reached in March. Highland Capital previously recorded a big success with its investment in Qihoo 360, a Chinese Internet security company that went public in 2011 and now has a market capitalization above $20 billion. Mr. Kleczynski said Malwarebytes is still profitable, but he wanted to raise additional money to hire more employees, including sales people and engineers. Malwarebytes, though it would not disclose its revenue or profit, said it had 60 million quarterly active users of its products. ""We don't see that kind of size very often at all, particularly for a company that has literally bootstrapped itself,"" said Jeremiah Daly, the partner at Highland Capital who placed the original call. Malwarebytes, based in San Jose, Calif., offers a free product as well as a subscription antivirus service, and it has attracted individual and business customers. The free product, which can be downloaded from the company's website, provides a one-time cleanup of a Windows computer, seeking to neutralize intruders that other antivirus programs don't catch. Malwarebytes hopes that users will enjoy the experience enough to sign up for the $25-per-year subscription service, which can supplement an existing antivirus program. Mr. Kleczynski, 24, became interested in malicious software in 2004, when his parents' computer became infected. He went to online forums to do research. Several years later, while participating in an online forum, he encountered Bruce Harrison, who would help him start Malwarebytes. But the two initially did not meet in person. Only when the company started taking off did they arrange a meeting. ""I met Bruce in person after we made our first million dollars,"" Mr. Kleczynski said. Mr. Kleczynski, who said he worked on the company while attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, moved just a few days ago to San Jose.  Now, with new investors, Malwarebytes is hoping to continue its growth. Highland is planning to take a hands-on approach, including by helping to hire employees, Mr. Daly said.  ""It took months and months of meeting and convincing that Highland could add value to the company,"" Mr. Daly said, ""before we closed the investment."" "
E.C.B. Says It Has Been Hacked in Apparent Blackmail Attempt,"FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank said on Thursday that hackers had broken into one of its databases and stolen information about journalists and others, in what appeared to be part of a blackmail scheme.  The central bank said that the information stolen was from people who have registered for central bank events, which include news conferences or gatherings of people from other central banks in Europe or elsewhere. The information contained relatively harmless data like names, email addresses and telephone numbers. Still, the incident was embarrassing for an institution that prizes security and confidentiality. The central bank has a trove of highly confidential information including records of transactions between commercial banks in the eurozone and the central bank, and communications between the E.C.B. and other central banks. No market-sensitive data was compromised, the central bank said in a statement, adding that the hacked database was part of the public website and was not connected to any other internal systems. ''The E.C.B. takes data security extremely seriously,'' the central bank said. The theft was discovered after the bank received an anonymous email on Monday seeking money in return for the data. The bank said the German police were investigating the theft, and that its own security experts had addressed the weakness in the database. A spokeswoman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's office said no arrests had been made in the case. She would not comment on whether the authorities had any suspects, or say how much money the hackers were seeking. Information on at least two International New York Times reporters was among the data stolen, according to emails that the bank sent to the reporters. "
"Sony Breach, Now Wider, Draws Alert From F.B.I.","LOS ANGELES -- Just as Sony Pictures Entertainment appeared to be recovering from a crippling online attack last month, the studio found itself confronting new perils on Tuesday. The Federal Bureau of Investigation warned United States businesses of a similar threat, and additional Sony secrets were leaked online. Sony, the studio behind ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' films and the ''Breaking Bad'' television series, restarted many of its computer systems on Monday after a Nov. 24 breach by a group calling itself #GOP, for Guardians of Peace. Executives at the entertainment company said they were also making progress in fighting the apparently related Internet pirating of five complete films, including the unreleased ''Annie.'' But Sony was newly rattled by the leak of internal documents, one of which contained the pre-bonus annual salaries of senior executives, showing 17 who earn more than $1 million a year. The documents were published late Monday on Pastebin, the anonymous Internet posting site. The breach exposed two things the secretive movie industry is extremely sensitive about -- the piracy of films and details about executive compensation -- and sent a ripple of dread across Hollywood to Washington.  Although large attacks on companies are increasingly common, this one has played out like one of Sony's own thrillers, with macabre images on computer screens of studio executives' severed heads and theories that the attack could be retribution from North Korea for a coming Sony comedy about an assassination attempt on that country's leader, Kim Jong-un. Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro, the private security firm, said that unlike stealth attacks from China and Russia, Sony's hackers not only aimed to steal data, but also to send a clear message. ''This was like a home invasion where after taking the family jewels the hackers set the house ablaze,'' he said. The attack at Sony comes as major American companies and government agencies are still reeling from online security threats. Breaches at major retailers like Target, Home Depot and Staples were only the beginning. Over the last year, the White House, the State Department, the nation's largest bank, energy companies, even the Postal Service, were all breached by attackers who have yet to be identified or apprehended. But the Sony attack, and new details about a spate of coordinated cyberattacks from Iran that emerged on Tuesday, have security experts and law enforcement authorities rattled, worried that Sony's difficulties may be a harbinger of many more to come. ''In 2015 hackers will destroy systems not just for activism, but also for counter-incident response,'' said Mr. Kellermann, suggesting that it would be more difficult for security firms and companies to investigate, respond and recover from cyberattacks. The F.B.I. issued a private bulletin late Monday to a wide range of companies about a malicious software threat that wipes data from computers beyond the point of recovery. The agency did not name the companies attacked, or say whether the bulletin was linked to the Sony attack, but the description mirrored the findings at Sony. The F.B.I. on Monday confirmed that it was working with the company to investigate the attack. Joshua Campbell, an F.B.I. spokesman, said on Tuesday that the agency's ''flash'' warning, first reported by Reuters, was a routine advisory intended to ''help systems administrators guard against the actions of persistent cybercriminals.'' Two people with knowledge of the advisory's contents said the bulletin warned companies of malware that could destroy data on their hard drives and prevent computers from rebooting. The malware overwrites data in such a way that it can be nearly impossible to recover using standard means. Sony declined to comment on Tuesday beyond its previously released statements. ''The company has restored a number of important services to ensure ongoing business continuity and is working closely with law enforcement officials to investigate the matter,'' one statement read. Sony is notably dealing with the breach and its aftermath without a public relations chief, having dismissed its top corporate communications executive the week before the attack occurred. To restore its computer systems, Sony's movie and television divisions -- a large music unit was not affected -- hired the Mandiant division of FireEye, one of the larger online security firms. With Mandiant's help, business on Monday largely returned to normal at the studio, according to employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A previously scheduled town hall gathering to welcome a new movie marketing and distribution executive went forward as planned. The usual trade news trickled out -- a casting announcement here, an international television deal there. Inside Sony's offices on Tuesday the mood was subdued but far from panicked, according to several employees, who said the attack had led to an unusually high degree of camaraderie. But they remained nervous about the breach of personal data and the possibility of identity theft. On Pastebin, hackers released on Monday evening what they said were ''tens of terabytes'' worth of internal Sony data. The post -- titled ''Gift of G.O.P.'' -- included links to various archives that appeared to contain Sony employees' passwords, Social Security numbers, salaries and performance reviews. (The password to open many of the files was ''diespe123'' (presumably an abridgment of ''Die Sony Pictures Entertainment''). The studio has offered to enroll employees in a fraud protection program. ''The problem is that every time there is another leak, people clench up all over again,'' said one executive in Sony's home entertainment division. On Nov. 24, just as Sony employees were settling into their work day, the hacking group took over many of the studio's internal systems. Some screens included images of a menacing red skeleton with the warning, ''If you don't obey us, we'll release data shown below to the world.'' What Sony was to obey was not specified and, aside from the pirated films, no corporate data was leaked -- until the salary information showed up, along with Social Security numbers, marketing plans, financial information and even the script to an in-house recruiting video, posted to Pastebin Monday evening. The information has since been pulled from the site. The hackers also took over certain Twitter feeds for Sony films. For instance, an account for ''Starship Troopers,'' a science fiction series, was hacked to say, ''You, the criminals including Michael Lynton will surely go to hell. Nobody can help you.'' Mr. Lynton is Sony's chief executive. The intrusion prompted Sony technicians to shut down the studio's computer systems, leaving employees without email, the Internet or voice mail. Movie and television production continued, in part because the studio operates a separate, more secure system for processing video. Why Sony? Although the studio is exploring multiple explanations, one theory involves North Korea. This Christmas, Sony plans to release ''The Interview,'' an R-rated comedy about two American journalists who are recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to kill Mr. Kim. A spokesman for North Korea's Foreign Ministry called the film -- apparently after seeing a trailer -- ''the most undisguised terrorism and a war action.'' The spokesman added that the film would invite ''a strong and merciless countermeasure.'' The destructive attack at Sony mirrors similar attacks last year on computers inside South Korea that paralyzed the computer networks at three major South Korean banks and two of the country's largest broadcasters. Those attacks were traced back to computer addresses inside China, though many suspected that hackers inside China were working on behalf of North Korea, retaliating against South Korea for conducting military exercises with the United States, and for supporting recent American-led sanctions against the north. Regardless, Sony is moving ahead with the release of the comedy. Seth Rogen, who stars in the movie, on Tuesday began a round of long-scheduled publicity interviews. "
New Security Report Confirms Everyone Is Spying On Everyone,"Lest we forget, the National Security Agency is in good company. A new security report confirms that Chinese hackers spied on The New York Times in 2012, as well as attendees of the G20 Summit in St. Petersburg last fall. Iranian hackers spied on dissidents in the lead up to state elections last May. The Syrian Electronic Army is only getting better, and North Korean hackers were behind a destructive cyberattack that wiped data from South Korean banks last year.  These were just some of the findings of CrowdStrike, the hot Laguna Niguel, Calif. security start-up which tracked more than 50 hacking groups last year. The company, started by George Kurtz, the antivirus company McAfee's former chief technology officer, and Dmitry Alperovitch, McAfee's former vice president of threat research, produced its findings in an annual report Wednesday. The report buttresses previous findings by The New York Times, Google, and a number of other security firms, including FireEye, the Milpitas, Calif. based security software firm that acquired Mandiant last year. It also offered a number of interesting new discoveries. Among them:  Needless to say, this won't be slow year for the $67 billion cybersecurity industry.  "
Microsoft Software Leak Inquiry Raises Privacy Issues,"SEATTLE -- Technology companies have spent months denying they know anything about broad government spying on people who use their Internet services. But a legal case filed this week against a former Microsoft employee shows the power these companies themselves have to snoop on their customers whenever they want to. Microsoft accused the former employee of stealing company trade secrets in the form of software code for the Windows operating system, and leaking the software to a blogger. In an investigation, the company figured out who revealed the information by reading the emails and instant messages of the blogger on his Microsoft-operated Hotmail and message accounts.  While Microsoft's actions appear to have been legal and within the scope of its own policies, its reading of the private online accounts of a customer without a court order was highly unusual and raises questions about its protections for customer data, privacy lawyers say. ''What blogger will use that service now?'' said Jennifer Granick, an attorney and director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. Ms. Granick said it appeared that Microsoft's actions were within the boundaries of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which allows service providers to read and disclose customers' communications if it is necessary to protect the rights or property of the service provider. Still, she called the move by Microsoft ''stupid'' and said it should raise concerns among bloggers and journalists about using Microsoft Internet services to communicate with their sources. Microsoft said it had done nothing wrong, but seemed to acknowledge the unusual nature of its actions -- as well as a brewing outcry over its methods of investigating the former employee -- by saying it would take several new steps to reassure customers that their communications will be private. In a statement, John E. Frank, a Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel, said that in the future, if the company had evidence of a crime against Microsoft, it would submit that evidence to an outside lawyer who is a former judge, and that it would conduct a search of private communications only if the judge concluded there was enough evidence to meet the standards for a court order. Companies do not need to obtain court orders to search their own services, Mr. Frank said. He said the company would also state the number of searches of customer accounts that it conducted itself as part of a broader transparent report it publishes periodically on government and court orders. ''The privacy of our customers is incredibly important to us, and while we believe our actions in this particular case were appropriate given the specific circumstances, we want to be clear about how we will handle similar situations going forward,'' Mr. Frank said. Criticism of Microsoft began mounting on Thursday after a report on a news site, Seattlepi.com, about the case. The details were especially troubling for people who saw potential implications for journalists. ''I have never seen a case like this,'' said Edward Wasserman, the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at University of California, Berkeley. ''Microsoft essentially decided that whatever privacy expectation that its own customers supposedly had was basically a dead letter. It simply decided that in its own corporate interest, it can intrude on a person's email.'' In the case, filed in federal court earlier this week in Seattle, Microsoft accused Alex Kibkalo, the former employee, of leaking the Windows code to a French blogger in 2012. As part of an internal Microsoft investigation at the time, Microsoft examined the blogger's private Microsoft email and instant messaging accounts and discovered evidence that the blogger had received confidential information and Windows software code from Mr. Kibkalo, who worked as a software architect for Microsoft in Lebanon. The blogger is not identified in the complaint, but the person is described as specializing in publishing leaked screenshots and other information about Microsoft products on the web. Much of the details in the complaint, which was filed by an agent for the F.B.I., were based on Microsoft's own inquiry. Mr. Kibkalo, a Russian national, was arrested in Seattle this week. Russell Leonard, a public defender assigned to represent him, did not respond to requests for comment. The picture that Microsoft's investigation of the blogger paints is not a flattering one. The complaint says a Microsoft investigative team interviewed the blogger, during which the person admitted to receiving confidential information and software from Mr. Kibkalo. The blogger also admitted to selling activation keys for Windows Server software on eBay, the complaint said. Microsoft reached a confidentiality agreement with the blogger, which is why he is not identified in the complaint, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Nate Cardozo, a staff lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy rights group, said that a number of companies had broad terms of service, but that it was extremely rare that any actually follow through and sift through a customer's personal email. ''To see Microsoft using this right to essentially look through a blogger's email account for evidence of wrongdoing and then turn it over on a silver platter for law enforcement, it is extremely undesirable,'' Mr. Cardozo said.

"The Privacy Paradox, a Challenge for Business","People around the world are thrilled by the ease and convenience of their smartphones and Internet services, but they aren't willing to trade their privacy to get more of it.  That is the top-line finding of a new study of 15,000 consumers in 15 countries. The privacy paradox was surfaced most directly in one question: Would you be willing to trade some privacy for greater convenience and ease?  Worldwide, 51 percent replied no, and 27 percent said yes. (The remainder had no opinion or didn't know.) There were country-by-country differences, but there was a consistency to the results, especially in the developed nations. The United States was 56 percent no and 21 percent yes. Britain was almost identical - 55 percent no, 18 percent yes. Germany was most privacy protective - 71 percent no, and 12 percent yes. India, by contrast, had the highest yes percentage - 48 percent, to 40 percent no.  The study, conducted by Edelman Berland, a market research firm, and sponsored by EMC, the data storage giant, has some other intriguing results with implications for business. Consumers worldwide seem to strongly agree with the notion that there should be laws ""to prohibit businesses from buying an selling data without my opt-in consent"" - 87 percent.  When asked to name the leading threats to online privacy in the future, 51 percent of the global panel of consumers picked ""businesses using, trading or selling my personal data for financial gain without my knowledge or benefit."" That was well ahead of the 35 percent who selected ""lone/crazy hackers, hacker groups or anarchist types."" The prying eyes of government - ""my government spying on me"" - was cited as a serious privacy threat by only 21 percent, even in the wake of the Edward Snowden leaks that showed the sweeping surveillance programs of American and British intelligence agencies.  The survey seems to present a grim outlook for data-driven online businesses and marketers. But there are caveats. Like most surveys of consumer attitudes about privacy, the questions posed are in general terms. Privacy? Well, that's a good thing, yes.  But marketplaces, online and off, are arenas of particular behavior - transactions, which are exchanges of value between two parties. And online, people trade their data - bits of their privacy - all the time for convenience and for products and services they value. How knowingly they make those trades is certainly open to debate, if not doubt.  Companies try to create an environment of trust around their products and brand. When a person downloads a company's smartphone app, he or she trusts the company, implicitly. Walk into any Starbucks, for example, and you see that environment of trust, or at least the appeal of overwhelming convenience, as people wave their smartphones over a laser-sensor to pay for drinks and redeem digital coupons. Starbucks and other retailers' smartphone apps collect a lot more information on those customers than the people paying in cash, or even with credit cards - personal data, buying habits and location. But the more data a company collects, the greater the risk of misuse or doing things that will make your customers uncomfortable, said Jeremy Burton, president for products and marketing for EMC. For example, if you are pharmacy chain, the data from online and offline sources that can be mined today can fairly accurately identify people likely to be diabetics. Do you market diabetic-related products to them? It is certainly personalized marketing, but is it creepy?  Conversations with customers, Mr. Burton said, increasingly cover not just what can be done with EMC's data storage and analysis tools, but also what they should do. Most companies oppose new regulations to curb data collection and use, and they may well prevail, certainly in the United States. But if we live in a big data ""Wild West,"" then every company has to be the sheriff of its own brand. A company's data practices must be guided mainly by its own business model and ethics, or not. In an essay earlier this year on the Harvard Business Review blog, ""Big Data's Dangerous New Era of Discrimination,""Michael Schrage, a research fellow at the M.I.T. Center for Digital Business, addressed that issue. ""Tomorrow's Big Data challenge isn't technical,"" Mr. Schrage wrote. ""It's whether managements have algorithms and analytics that are both fairly transparent and transparently fair.""                        "
Google Ready to Comply With 'Right to Be Forgotten' Rules in Europe,"LONDON - Your right to be forgotten on the Internet is almost here. Google will start to remove links to online content in Europe by the end of the month to comply with a recent landmark European court ruling intended to  protect individuals' privacy, according to sources with direct knowledge of the issue, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter. This step follows a monthlong effort  by Google to comply with the European Court of Justice's decision, which requires all search providers operating in Europe to consider people's requests to remove links that they say violate their online privacy.  Last month, Google created a rudimentary framework, including a new online form for making such requests. Google has already received more than 50,000 submissions from people asking the company to remove links. That includes more than 12,000 requests  within the first 24 hours of the form's being made available, according to one of the people with direct knowledge of the matter. Google this week began notifying individuals - both those residing in Europe and people living outside the region - that their submissions would soon be acted upon. An internal team, led by Google's legal department, will review each request to decide if it meets the necessary requirements intended to protect Europeans' online privacy. If Google approves the request, the company will remove the web link within the 28-nation European Union as well as in Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The decisions would affect the German domain google.de, for example, but the link would still be available at google.com  from anywhere in the world. Through Google's new online form, people based in Europe must list web links that they want removed. They have to explain why those search results are irrelevant, outdated or otherwise inappropriate, as well as provide photo identification. It remains unclear whether the legal ruling applies only to  people living in Europe, or if people based outside the region, including in the United States, can request that online links be taken down. Google has been in touch with several of Europe's national data protection regulators, which will have final say if individuals do not agree with Google's  decision regarding the suspect links, about how best to carry out the European Court of Justice's ruling. While the company will start to remove links by the end of June, the process is expected to take several weeks before it is fully operational. Google's  engineering teams - both in Europe and further afield - have been tweaking the company's search infrastructure since the ruling was made in May. The changes to Google's operations will allow for the removal of search results linked to a person's name, which is mandated by the legal ruling, but will still allow the same links to be displayed if people search for other topics online. As part of Google's efforts to comply with the ruling, the company created an advisory group of privacy experts, regulators, academics and company executives. The group includes Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, who has been a vocal opponent of the European court decision. The committee will have no power to  force Google to change its practices, but will instead offer recommendations by the end of the year about how the privacy ruling may affect the company's presentation of search results to its users worldwide. The group has yet to meet, but it is expected to gather in the near future, before traveling to several European countries to hold local meetings and gauge how Europeans want their online  privacy to be protected. "
Google to Tour Europe to Discuss Privacy,"LONDON - Google is about to start a grand tour of Europe. The search engine company will soon send a group of executives and legal experts, including the company's executive chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, around the region to explain Google's stance on online privacy.  The series of meetings, which is expected to start as early as September and last up to nine months, will form part of the company's response to a recent European court ruling that gives people the right to ask that links about themselves be removed from certain Internet searches. On Friday in Europe, Google is expected to open a website for its 10-person privacy advisory group. The site is to include an online form where people can give suggestions for how the company should respond to the court's decision. The privacy committee includes Mr. Schmidt and Google's top lawyer, David C. Drummond. Other members are Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, who has been a vocal critic of Europe's so-called right to be forgotten, and several European data protection experts, including José Luis Piñar, a former Spanish privacy regulator. Google, which announced the creation of the committee in May, is expected to announce on Friday in Europe the selection of three new members, including Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, a former German justice minister, and Sylvie Kauffmann, editorial director at the French newspaper Le Monde. Google will not pay the external committee members for their time, although it will cover their expenses. The group will publish a report next year recommending how search engines should respond to the European court's privacy ruling. The recommendations, however, will only advise the company on its future privacy efforts, and might not be carried out. The steps come as the tech giant, which runs Europe's most popular search engine, has struggled to deal with the more than 80,000 requests from individuals who want links to online content to be removed. The court's ruling has pitted freedom of expression advocates against online privacy groups. Google's efforts to comply with the complicated legal decision have misfired somewhat. That includes removing links to articles from several prominent European news organizations, including the BBC and The Guardian, only to later reinstate some of the links after the media outlets complained. The privacy committee will meet privately in July before starting a six-country European tour. The group will visit France, Spain, Germany, Poland, Britain and Italy. In each country, it will hold a public meeting in which local experts will give their opinions about the implications of the European court's decision, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The meetings will be spread out over a period of months. The people who will speak to Google's privacy group will be chosen from submissions to the  form on the committee's website and recommendations from the 10-person privacy team, according to one of the people with direct knowledge of the matter. During the yearlong process, the advisory group is expected to focus on how search engines like Google can respond to the right-to-be-forgotten ruling. It  will also look at how to balance individuals' right to privacy with the people's need for freedom of expression, as both rights are enshrined almost equally in European law. "
Baby Pictures at the O.B.'s Office? No More.,"If you've been charmed, annoyed, or brought to your knees with envy over the wall of photos of babies at your doctor's office, prepare to be met instead by less personal photography or art (Georgia O'Keeffe, perhaps?). Because of legal and privacy concerns, doctors' offices are moving their bulletin boards of holiday cards into back offices and tucking into locked files the photos parents bring in to share. (Read more: Baby Pictures at the Doctor's? Cute, Sure, but Illegal.)  Many doctors, like Dr. Mark V. Sauer of Columbia University's Center for Women's Reproductive Care, speaking in the video above, see it as a loss - yet another step in the depersonalization of medical care. Baby pictures put a caring touch on an otherwise clinical space, and served as a reminder that the practice's relationship with patients was both professional and personal.  But the federal patient privacy law known as HIPAA  classifies baby photos  as a type of protected health information, no less than a medical chart, birth date or Social Security number, even those sent by the patient to the practice. As Dr. Sauer says, pictures that could once be counted on to stay on the bulletin board can be snapped with a camera phone to ""show up almost anywhere."" Particularly where fertility is involved, even patients who share pictures may not be prepared for their association with a particular practice to appear in an acquaintance's Facebook post. I never sent any pictures to our doctors' offices, but although I understand the concern, I'll miss the walls of baby pictures. Will you?

Are Parents Violating Their Children's Privacy When They Share Photos and Videos of Them Online?,"Parents seem to love posting videos and photos of their children online, sometimes for the whole world to see on YouTube and Facebook. But are children going to grow up regretting being a viral star? Should they somehow have a say in the matter?  Are parents violating their children's privacy when they share photos and videos of them online?  In the Room for Debate feature on ""Children and Digital Privacy,"" panelists weighed in on the subject.  Amy Webb, the founder and chief executive of Webbmedia Group, writes: It seems reasonable enough. On the last day of your daughter's soccer camp, you snap a few photos of her with the ball. During the game, you record video. After her victory, you take some more pictures of your sweaty mess, because you're a proud parent. The problem is what happens next, that moment you decide to upload those photos and videos from your cellphone to Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. Once you post and tag your child, she becomes subject to an array of databases over which you have little control. And James P. Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, writes: It's called ""oversharenting"" for a reason. If you do choose to share images of your kids online, consider the history and reputation you're creating for them. How will they feel about their digital footprints in five years? How will these footprints affect the way other people see them? Consider using a social network's settings to create small, closed groups that include a limited number of people with whom you share more private moments. Even then, be vigilant about content. There's a difference between broadcasting a moment of pride - the first piano recital or the winning goal - and posting something sensitive or potentially embarrassing.  Students: Read the entire article, then tell us ... -  Are parents violating their children's privacy when they share photos and videos of them online? Why? -  Should parents be concerned about leaving an unwanted ""digital footprint"" for their child?  -  Does it make a difference if a parent is sharing a moment of pride, such as a piano recital, rather than an embarrassing or sensitive moment? -  Does it matter if parents are sharing with just family and friends, or with the entire Internet? -  Has a parent or guardian ever posted childhood pictures or videos of you online that you wish they hadn't? Explain.  Students 13 and older are invited to comment below. Please use only your first name. For privacy policy reasons, we will not publish student comments that include a last name.                        "
Europe Digital Nominee Demands Stronger U.S. Data Rules,"Europe may suspend data-sharing agreements with the United States if American policy makers do not improve how Europeans' online information is protected, according to Andrus Ansip, the nominee to lead Europe's digital agenda. His statements could have major implications for American tech giants like Google and Facebook, which routinely compile data generated by their European customers through web searches and other online activities. Those companies' data policies have come under greater scrutiny in Europe in the wake of the revelations about spying by the National Security Agency, using online data.  Mr. Ansip, 58, said that the United States still had to convince European lawmakers that it took a hard line on data protection.  ""Americans have to deliver and provide real trust to European citizens,"" Mr. Ansip, a former prime minister of Estonia, said during a three-hour hearing in Brussels on Monday. In reference to the so-called safe harbor agreement between Europe and the United States, which allows American tech companies to move Europeans' data to America as long as the companies uphold the same privacy rules, he added: ""If we don't get clear answers, suspension has to stay as an option."" Mr. Ansip's comments follow similar warnings by other European politicians, who have criticized the United States for taking a relatively lax approach to online privacy. In response, American officials, particularly those at the Federal Trade Commission who oversee the safe harbor agreement, say they regularly fine companies that flout the rules. The public hearing on Monday was part of two weeks of questions at the European Parliament in which lawmakers have questioned the prospective new members of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union that will start work on Nov. 1. If he becomes chief of Europe's digital agenda, Mr. Ansip - who led Estonia, one of the world's most digitally advanced countries, for nearly a decade - will most likely have to tackle reforms of the Continent's privacy rules and efforts to build digital collaboration across the 28-member bloc. He would also be in charge of completing an overhaul of Europe's digital rules - call the Connected Continent proposals - that are aimed at creating one single digital market across the European Union. These are expected to be completed early next year. During the lengthy hearing on Monday, Mr. Ansip regularly emphasized that the protection of people's online data was his most important goal. ""We have to protect everyone's privacy,"" he said. ""Trust is a basic principle. If people can't trust e-services, they will never use them."" As part of this online privacy push, Mr. Ansip said he backed efforts by some European politicians to create a so-called charter of Internet rights, a legally binding document that would outline people's digital freedoms. A similar law was recently passed in Brazil. The proposed new European commissioner also supported plans to impose so-called net neutrality rules, which are based on the principle that everyone should have equal access to online content. Local lawmakers recently passed legislation proposing that no company could charge for better access to their networks. But in a slight opening for European telecommunications and broadband operators, which would like to charge more for improved Internet access, Mr. Ansip said that they could offer different services as long as basic Internet access was not affected. ""Higher prices for higher speeds are acceptable, but not at the price of others,"" he said.  For a politician whose own country won independence from the Soviet Union only in the early 1990s, Mr. Ansip took a somewhat hard line on efforts to control how information was spread online. In response to questions about Europe's so-called right to be forgotten, which allows people to ask search engines like Google to remove links to online information about them, he said keeping information public was important. ""The right to be forgotten has to stay as an exception,"" Mr. Ansip said.                       "
F.T.C. Names New Chief Technologist,"The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's top consumer protection regulator, appointed a privacy expert and former journalist as its chief technologist on Tuesday, a signal that the commission intends to maintain a close watch on online privacy and security issues.  The appointee, Ashkan Soltani, is an independent technology consultant. As an investigative reporter for The Washington Post last year, he co-wrote some of the articles in that paper's Pulitzer Prize-winning series stemming from the Edward Snowden revelations. Previously, Mr. Soltani worked as chief technical consultant for The Wall Street Journal on its ""What They Know"" series about online tracking and as a technology researcher for The New York Times. Mr. Soltani succeeds Latanya Sweeney, who is returning to Harvard, where she founded and directs Harvard's Data Privacy Lab, the commission said. Edith Ramirez, chairwoman of the F.T.C., said Mr. Soltani would advise the commission on evolving technology and policy issues, returning to the agency, where he worked as a staff technologist in 2010 and 2011. ""Technology and online and mobile platforms are continuing to evolve at a rapid pace and will remain a key focus for the F.T.C. as more and more consumers adopt mobile devices and tablets,"" Ms. Ramirez said. Mr. Soltani will join the commission in November.                       "
Verizon Wireless Under Fire for Ad-Targeting Program,"Google and Facebook are not the only companies tracking your online activities to customize ads. Verizon Wireless has recently come under fire from privacy advocates for running a similar program on its cellular network.  Verizon quietly started its ad-targeting program two years ago and this yearteamed up with other data management and advertising companies. Late last month, Jacob Hoffman-Andrews of the Electronic Frontier Foundation noticed the program and sounded the alarm. ""Verizon users might want to start looking for another provider,"" hewrote in a blog post on Monday about the program, which involves injecting a header containing a unique, anonymous identifier into a Verizon Wireless user's request for a web page. ""Indeed, while we're concerned about Verizon's own use of the header, we're even more worried about what it allows others to find out about Verizon users."" Verizon's ad-targeting method groups these identifiers into different buckets of demographics and interests, so if a website is looking to serve certain ads to a specific type of customer, it will look for those buckets and serve up those ads. Here's the kicker: Even though Verizon allows users to opt out of the program by calling a phone number or changing their privacy settings, Verizon keeps tacking an identifier onto the customer's web browsing for ""other authentication purposes,"" such as logging in to Verizon's apps, according to the company. A Verizon spokeswoman declined to comment but pointed to a company document explaining its marketing program. In the document, Verizon says it frequently changes the anonymous identifier to protect customer privacy. The company adds that it is unlikely that websites and ad companies could create profiles on customers, because the identifiers change often. The Electronic Frontier Foundation says it is concerned that Verizon could be violating a federal law requiring phone companies to keep customer data confidential. In September, Verizon agreed to a $7.4 million settlement with the Federal Communications Commission, which found that Verizon's landline business had failed to inform two million customers of their privacy rights, including the ability to opt out of marketing programs. Mr. Hoffman-Andrews said in an interview that he was concerned about what marketing companies and government agencies like the National Security Agency could do with these web-browsing identifiers. They could stitch together someone's anonymous identifier with web cookies to create a detailed profile that follows the person's web-browsing activities, even after Verizon generates a new anonymous identifier for the user, he said. Verizon is not alone in its effort to expand into mobile marketing. AT&T acknowledged that it was testing a similar program, which involved inserting a numeric code into a user's web requests. This code would change every 24 hours, and if AT&T goes forward with the program, it will allow users to opt out completely, meaning the identifier would stop being inserted altogether, according to Emily Edmonds, a director of corporate communications for AT&T. ""Many different companies use advertising identifiers today, including handset and operating system manufacturers,"" Ms. Edmonds said in a statement. ""We believe that we would be providing industry-leading privacy protections."" The Electronic Frontier Foundation said it was weighing its options for taking action against Verizon. It could file a complaint with the F.C.C., file a class-action complaint or ask state attorneys general to investigate the matter. "
ClassDojo Adopts Deletion Policy for Student Data,"The maker of ClassDojo, a popular behavioral tracking app used in schools across the United States, announced revisions on Tuesday in the way it retains student information. Starting in January, the company intends to keep students' behavioral records for only one school year.  ""We are not a data company. So we have no need to keep any data beyond allowing it to be communicated between teachers, parents and students,"" Sam Chaudhary, the co-founder of ClassDojo, wrote in an email to a reporter. ""We think one year will give busy parents an opportunity to find time to review this information.""  An article in The New York Times on Monday reported on the concerns of some educators that schools were using software that collects sensitive details about students without sufficiently considering the ramifications for data privacy and fairness.  One issue they raised was the possibility that a third-party database - which regularly collected and stored details about individual students' behavior - could potentially saddle a student with a ""problem child"" label.  ClassDojo's new deletion policy directly addressed that concern. ""We want to help kids succeed by recognizing and sharing the things they do well,"" the company said. ""No part of that vision needs 'permanent records.' "" Privacy experts said the company's policy was a step in the right direction. ""Routine deletion is not a new idea, but it's a good idea,"" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit research center in Washington. He added that deleting students' records annually should eliminate the risk that their information would subsequently be used for other purposes.  ClassDojo, a free app, allows teachers to select behaviors - like ""following directions"" or ""disrespect"" - for which they can reward students with points or subtract points. Teachers can use the system to create a virtual classroom, using the names of the students and giving each of them a monster avatar.  Teachers can display the points on an interactive whiteboard, allowing every child to monitor his or her own score and classmates' scores in real time. The app beeps every time a student gains or loses a point. At least one teacher in roughly one of three schools uses ClassDojo, according to the app's maker. But for more than a year, ClassDojo has generated vociferous debate among teachers, principals and parents, over its point-based behavior feedback approach as well as the option it gives teachers to display students' scores publicly, which some have compared to public shaming. The article generated similar passionate responses among Times readers and on social media. Many teachers who use ClassDojo say it has helped them better manage their classrooms, promote good conduct and communicate with parents who have signed up for accounts. ""I love Class Dojo and I am somewhat shocked over the uproar. I use it almost entirely for positive reasons,"" a sixth-grade teacher wrote in the comments section accompanying the article. She added: ""It is much better to reward the kids who are doing the right thing than be constantly screaming at the ones who are misbehaving."" A parent in Vermont whose child's prekindergarten class used ClassDojo registered concern. ""I despise it,"" the parent wrote, adding: ""It is all a big cartoony bribe system, you go to the website and there is no information whatsoever before signing up, it is just another flashy colorful annoying waste of time that gave off huge alarm bells to me."" But the debate over ClassDojowas raging well before the article called attention to it.  Witness this exchange last week among educators on Twitter weighing in on the app's public scoreboard and noises.

Complaint Says Ring Pop Campaign Violated Children's Privacy,"In many ways, it was a typical social media marketing campaign featuring user-generated content -  only this promotion involved a brand popular with children. Earlier this year, the company behind Ring Pop, a jewel-shaped sucking candy on a plastic ring, ran a contest called #RockThatRock. It invited users to post photos on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram of ""how they 'rock' their edible bling,"" as one fan site put it, and to use the #RockThatRock hashtag. The winning photos were featured in a music video by R5, a pop-rock band popular with teenage and pre-teenage girls. Some of the #RockThatRock photos were posted on the brand'sFacebook and Twitter pages, along with contestants' social media user names. Some of those photos depicted teenaged girls -  and a few who looked even younger - in provocative poses, with their lips puckered around Ring Pop candies.  Now, 10 advocacy groups have asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the Topps Company, the maker of Ring Pops, accusing the company of violating a federal children's privacy protection law. That law, called theChildren's Online Privacy Protection Act or Coppa, requires operators of sites directed at children to notify parents and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information - including photos and screen names that could be used to directly contact users online - from children under 13. ""Showing young girls licking the candy in a Lolita-type way, it's outrageous,"" said Michael Brody, a child psychiatrist in Potomac, Md., who is the chairman of the media committee of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, one of the groups behind the complaint. By knowing the contestants' user names, he added, ""you could get in contact with them. Children shouldn't be put in this situation."" In the complaint, filed on Tuesday, the advocacy groups contended that Topps did not seek verifiable consent from parents before collecting, and then publicly disclosing, photos and screen names of children under 13. According to theterms of use for the Ring Pop contest, the act of ""voluntarily posting photographs, videos, comments or other material tagged with one of our promoted hashtags,"" constituted permission from users or their parents for the Topps Company to use, reproduce, modify, publish or broadcast that content. Executives at the Topps Company, which is owned by Madison Dearborn Partners and by the Tornante Company, a privately held firm founded by Michael Eisner, a former chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Although the contest encouraged users to submit photos of themselves via social media sites - not through the Topps Company's own candymania.com site - the complaint argues that the company was required to comply with the online privacy law because it benefited from the collection of children's personal information.  Facebook does not allow users to register if they say they are under 13, and Twitter and Instagram say they are not intended for use by children. But the advocacy groups noted that millions of younger children are believed to have social media accounts and that the company could not assume that all social media account users were 13 or older. The groups also argue in the complaint that Topps failed to accurately disclose its data collection practices in its privacy policy, and that the company continued to use children's photographs after the contest had ended. The children's online privacy rule requires that online operators retain personal information from children only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected. But the #RockThatRock music video - which the complaint contends includes photos of ""children who look younger than thirteen"" - remains on YouTube, where it has been seen nearly 900,000 times. The groups behind the complaint are led by the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit organization in Washington. Others include theRudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University; the Center for Science in the Public Interest; Consumer Action; Consumers Union; Consumer Watchdog; the Consumer Federation of America; the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood; and the Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ. ""Topps is so eager to harness children to promote their products that, regardless of whether this violates the law or is even appropriate, they are encouraging kids to go public on social media, exposing themselves to a vast unknown public,"" said Jeff Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. ""Beyond Topps, many companies are encouraging children to use social media, in violation of Coppa, to promote their products or brands."" This is not the first time a Topps Promotion has come under scrutiny from children's advocates. In 2011, the Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, investigated Topps for promoting online games for children without clearly signifying that the games were marketing tools intended to promote the sale of Ring Pops. Topps responded by adding a written disclosure - ""HEY KIDS THIS IS ADVERTISING"" - to its online games.                       "
Iowa Pursues a Virtual Driver's License App,"Iowa is hoping to become the first state in the nation to make the physical driver's license obsolete. This month, state transportation officials announced they were developing a mobile app that would enable residents to carry virtual versions of their driver's licenses on their smartphones. The news was first reported by The Des Moines Register. ""It's a digital driver's license,"" said Andrea Henry, director of strategic communications at the Iowa Department of Transportation. ""People can choose to have a plastic card, a digital license, or both.""  The electronic driver's licenses would contain the same personal identification details - like date of birth, gender and home address - as plastic card licenses. Like physical driver's licenses, the virtual licenses would also include a unique bar code that the police could scan during a traffic stop to verify the information with the Department of Transportation. But legal experts say the idea of using a smartphone, which typically contains vast amounts of personal information, instead of a physical government ID, introduces a host of data security and privacy issues.  ""It raises questions about what information the app is collecting, how the information is being secured, and what information is being exchanged at the point of use,"" said Alan Butler, senior counsel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research center in Washington. He also raised the possibility that a police officer checking someone's license on a phone might inadvertently, or deliberately, see other information like text messages, call logs or photos: ""Would this give police broader access to information they wouldn't normally get access to?"" The electronic license app is currently in the development stages.  Ms. Henry, the spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation, said her agency hoped to pilot-test the program internally next year and offer it to the public in 2016. In terms of security, she said, transportation officials envision that people would get access to their virtual licenses through a two-step authentication process - such as use of a personal identification number, along with a biometric identifier like a fingerprint, voice or face recognition. On the privacy issue, Ms. Henry said that state officials did not plan to use the app to track drivers. However, the app may include a privacy-preserving feature that prevents a user from looking at other information while the driver's license program is open, she said.  She added that police officers or airport security staff members should be able to scan virtual licenses without owners' ceding control of their phones. [#x200b] ""We don't anticipate the phone would ever leave the driver's hand,"" Ms. Henry said. But the Iowa State Patrol and other police departments are not currently equipped with hand-held scanning devices. The license scanners are integrated with computers in patrol cars.  ""We'd have to take the phone back to the squad car to scan it,"" said Sgt. Scott Bright, the public information officer for the Iowa State Patrol. ""I don't know how many citizens are going to want law enforcement to take their phones back to the squad cars."" He envisioned all sorts of security and privacy problems arising from an electronic driver's license app:  ""What happens if I drop your phone on the highway and a semi runs over it? Who will be liable?"" Sergeant Bright asked. He added:  ""What happens if your phone locks automatically? What happens if someone sends you a text message while I have the phone? I don't want to see anyone's text messages."" He suggested that state transportation officials rethink the app - or at least consult with the police departments that would be expected to work with it. Mr. Butler, the privacy law expert, had a similar view.  He pointed to a Supreme Court case last year concerning police searches of suspects' cellphones in which Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. noted that cellphones could allow access to ""vast quantities of personal information."" (Mr. Butler's group filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the defendant.) The court ultimately ruled that law enforcement searches of cellphones require a warrant. ""It's not a smart idea to create an app that implies people should be handing their cellphones over to police officers without clear implications of what that might mean,"" Mr. Butler said. "
Tech Companies and White House Discuss Surveillance Reform,"Representatives from tech companies including Google, Twitter, Yahoo and Microsoft met on Friday with White House staff members to discuss Internet surveillance reforms. The meeting was part of the Obama administration's weeklong effort to brief various groups before the president announces his proposals for national security reform, which he is expected to do on Jan. 17. The president also met with lawmakers on Thursday and with national security officials and privacy advocates on Wednesday.  Tension has arisen between the government and tech companies after revelations about the National Security Agency's surveillance practices, which include tapping into the networks of some tech companies without their knowledge or permission. Friday's meeting, which was called by the White House, was described as a working policy meeting for administration staff and leaders of the tech companies' policy teams, many of whom are based in Washington. ""This is another opportunity to share views as the administration nears completion of our internal review of signals intelligence,"" (a  technical term for electronic eavesdropping) Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters. Last month, top tech executives, including the chief executives of Apple, Yahoo and Twitter, met with President Obama and aired their grievances about surveillance. The president is trying to find a middle ground between what advocates for security and privacy have demanded. Some of the reforms he is said to be considering are appointing a public advocate at the secret intelligence court, ending the practice of spying on friendly foreign leaders and storing telephone metadata with a private third party or the telecommunication companies instead of the government.  "
Regulators Weigh In on Online Educational Services,"As school districts around the country increasingly turn to online educational services that can collect and analyze details about how individual students learn, some parents andlegislators have been raising questions about whether the personal information collected by such programs is federally protected from being shared or sold by technology vendors. On Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Education weighed in with an answer long awaited across the nearly $8 billion prekindergarten through 12th-grade education software industry: ""It depends.""  That careful wording came as part of new agency guidance that lays out requirements and recommended practices for school management of online education services that directly involve students or their parents. In the document, regulators seemed to acknowledge a recent report by student privacy researchers, which concluded that some school districts in the United States had adopted education technology faster than they had instituted policies to oversee vendor collection and use of student data. ""In particular, the information sharing, web hosting and telecommunication innovations that have enabled these new education technologies raise questions about how best to protect student privacy during use,"" the Education Department guidelines said. The guidelines provide specific examples of federal protections for personal details, like contact information, contained in a student's education record. Under a federal law, called the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, for instance, schools that receive federal funding must generally obtain parental permission before sharing information from a student's education record. Under an exception, however, schools may outsource functions, like tutoring or meal payment systems, without seeking parental consent for sharing student data. Even so, schools or districts outsourcing such services must maintain direct control over the data, restricting companies from unauthorized use of personally identifiable details about students. For instance, regulators wrote, the operator of a hypothetical cafeteria account site where parents pay online for their children's school lunches cannot sell the student roster or use personal details from students' education records to individually target a child with food advertisements. Likewise, if a school district sets up email and document-sharing accounts for students, the email provider cannot mine the content to target individual students with ads for clothing or toys. (The federal education privacy law does not prohibit schools or districts from allowing an online provider to show general ads to students.) The federal guidelines make clear that under the school outsourcing exception, online educational services cannot use protected student information they obtain ""for any other purpose than the purpose for which it was disclosed."" However, the law directly obliges districts or schools - not companies - to protect student data. On that score, a recent study by researchers at Fordham Law School indicated that some school districts had been remiss. For instance, the researchers reported that a few districts had not contractually specified the types of student details online vendors could collect, while some others allowed online service providers to freely modify their terms and conditions of service, potentially putting student data at risk of misuse. In the new document, the Education Department recommended that school districts establish direct control over the collection and use of students' personal details through contracts with service providers. It also recommended that districts not sign agreements allowing online education programs to alter their terms of service unilaterally.  "
U.S. and California Officials Enter Battle Over Facebook Privacy Settlement,"A couple of government wingmen have joined privacy groups in their legal dogfight with Facebook over the company's use of teenagers' likes and comments in advertising. On Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission filed a brief with the appeals court hearing the three-year-old case. It was the first time the agency, the nation's chief regulator on consumer privacy issues, has entered the dispute.  The F.T.C. said the judge who approved the settlement was wrong when he accepted Facebook's argument that a federal privacy law governing children under age 13 preempted state protections for older children. California's attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, filed a similar brief on Friday, arguing that the state's stricter privacy laws apply to teenagers because the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act defines a child as someone under 13.  Both the F.T.C. and Ms. Harris's office stressed that they were taking no position on the merits of the settlement itself and merely explaining their view of the line between federal and state jurisdiction. On a practical basis, however, the government interventions support the arguments made by the parents and privacy groups fighting a 2013 settlement in the class-action case. The challengers, which include Public Citizen and the Center for Digital Democracy, say that the settlement violates the laws of seven states, including California and New York, by failing to require Facebook to get explicit permission from parents before using the personal information of teenage users in advertising. Under the settlement, Facebook plans to institute a system for users aged 13 to 18 to indicate whether their parents are on Facebook, and will give those parents control over the use of their children's likes and comments in advertising. If the parents are not using Facebook, the company says it will opt their children out of social advertising until age 18. In a statement, Facebook said, ""The court correctly found that the settlement was a fair and reasonable resolution of the claims in this case after fully considering these issues. The California Attorney General and the F.T.C. are not challenging the fairness of the settlement, which is the sole question on appeal.""  "
Microsoft Touts Data Protection Approval in Europe; Eager for New Customers,"LONDON - Online privacy is heating up as a selling point, at least in Europe. Microsoft's top lawyer on Thursday said the company's cloud computing services had met Europe's stringent data protection rules - the only company so far to receive such approval - and he used the news as a way to woo potential new customers. ""For customers who care about privacy and compliance, there is no more committed partner than Microsoft,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in blog post on Thursday.  Privacy has become an increasingly important concern for American tech companies following the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, which tied some of these companies to the National Security Agency's vast surveillance program. In response, some companies and governments have starting to look elsewhere for computer services with a greater degree of privacy. International rivals, from Europe to South America, have gained some customers who are shunning American providers. Many of the major American companies have started to face some damage to their bottom lines because of the revelations.   ""The Snowden[#x200b] disclosures amounted to an earthquake for the tech sector,"" Mr. Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in an interview on Thursday. ""There may continue to be aftershocks."" This is the second time this year that Microsoft has tried to distance itself in the highly competitive cloud computing industry from rivals like Amazon and I.B.M. In January, Mr. Smith told the Financial Times that the company was deepening its commitment to allow customers to decide where their information is stored, in part because of concerns about spying by the N.S.A. Microsoft already operates big data centers in Amsterdam and Dublin, allowing European customers to store their data locally. And European customers who use some of the Microsoft's cloud-based products, like Office 365 and Dynamics CRM Online, have their data stored in Ireland or the Netherlands, while the data for Asia Pacific customers is stored in Singapore and Hong Kong, according to the company's website for those products. Similar arrangements exist for users of the company's Azure cloud computing service. The regionalized efforts are likely to become increasingly important, as European policy makers finalize new data protection and privacy rules, which are expected to come into force next year. The proposals could limit how companies like Google and Facebook share data between their operations in Europe and the United States. They also form part of a growing debate here over how consumers' online information should be used by technology companies and government agencies. The new data protection legislation, which runs in parallel to a separate bill aimed at revamping Europe's telecom industry, could have major financial implications for U.S. tech companies.  International companies with European customers, for example, would have to comply with strengthened privacy controls or face fines totaling 2 percent to 5 percent of global revenues, or $138 million, whichever is greater. European lawmakers also want to give people the right to have their online information erased and providing individuals greater control over what data is collected and where it is kept. Yet by showing that it already complies with Europe's strict privacy and data protection rules, the tech company is hoping that it can separate itself from other companies caught up in the Snowden scandal. ""We hope that our European customers won't look at our nationality, but at the commitments we have made around data protection,"" Mr. Smith said.[#x200b]  "
"After European Court Decision, Google Works on a Link Removal Tool","LONDON - Google will announce by the end of the month a mechanism for consumers to request that links to information about them be removed from the company's search engine, a leading European regulator said on Thursday. It was one of the first signs that Google was working through how to operate after a court ruling said consumers could make such requests.  Ulrich Kühn, [#x200b]head of the technical department at Hamburg's data protection regulator, one of Germany's leading data protection agencies, said that the details of the mechanism still had to be finalized. But a basic online tool for people to ask Google to take down potentially harmful links would be in place in about two weeks, he said. ""They are trying to come up with something that users can use to lodge complaints about specific links,"" Mr. Kühn said. ""It will be rolled out across Europe for all citizens."" Google would not comment on when the mechanism would be online or how the tool would work. In a statement, the search engine said the ruling on Tuesday by the Court of Justice of the European Union would have implications about how the company handles requests for information to be taken down. ""This is logically complicated,"" Google said in a statement. ""As soon as we have thought through exactly how this will work, which may take several weeks, we will let our users know."" The decision by Europe's top court to allow individuals to demand that Google take down links in certain instances has been seen as a landmark case in the Continent's push toward increased data privacy. The court's ruling centered on the so-called right to be forgotten, which would allow individuals to ask Google to remove links to certain online information about themselves. Unlike the United States, Europe places almost equal emphasis on the right to privacy and the right of freedom of expression. The judges ruled that search engine is a ""controller"" of individuals' data within the European Union, which means that the search engine must comply with the Continent's privacy rules. Previously, the company had been viewed as a mere ""processor"" of online data, which allowed it to circumvent local data protection laws. European data protection authorities say that since Tuesday's ruling, they've seen an increase in complaints from people looking for ways to take down online links to their past activities. Mr. Kühn said his office had received almost 20 complaints from Germans since Tuesday. On average, two people had contacted the authority each week before the Google court decision. ""The ruling took us by surprise,"" said Mr. Kühn, who contacted Google on Wednesday to find out how it would adjust to the court's decision. ""The court has cemented the right to be forgotten into European law.""  "
California Urges Websites to Disclose Online Tracking,"Every major Internet browser has a feature that lets you tell a website that you don't want it to collect personal information about you when you visit. And virtually every website ignores those requests. Tracking your online activities - and using that data to tailor marketing pitches - is central to how Internet companies make money. Now California's attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, wants every site to tell you - in clear language - if and how it is respecting your privacy preferences. The guidelines, which will be published on Wednesday, are intended to help companies comply with a new state privacy law that went into effect on Jan. 1. That law requires sites to prominently disclose all their privacy practices, including how they respond to ""do not track"" requests. ""This guide is a tool for businesses to create clear and transparent privacy policies that reflect the state's privacy laws and allow consumers to make informed decisions,"" Ms. Harris said in a statement.     The California guidelines for the Jan. 1 privacy law are voluntary. Other efforts to establish more binding privacy protections - either through federal or state laws or through industry self-regulation - have failed to win enough support to pass.  Jeff Rabkin, special assistant attorney general on technology and privacy matters, said that Ms. Harris's office would review companies' privacy policies and work with them to make sure they followed the new law. Those who don't comply will receive 30-day warnings before facing potential litigation from the state. The history of the ""do not track"" issue is a case study in how difficult it is to truly protect users' privacy on the Internet.  The Federal Trade Commission first proposed ""do not track"" rules in 2010. Nothing happened. Two years later, the White House announced a ""Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights,"" which stated that individuals should have control over their private information, including how they were tracked online. However, that document was just a statement of intent, with no teeth.  In an attempt to nudge the process along, two of the leading web browsers, Mozilla's Firefox and Microsoft's Internet Explorer, began giving users the option of sending a signal that tells all websites they visit that they don't want to be tracked. Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome later added similar options. But despite pledges by the advertising and technology industries to find a way to honor such requests - and endless discussions at an industry standards group, the World Wide Web Consortium, that was supposed to come up with a common set of rules - little progress has been made. This month, a White House advisory group again called for limits on tracking. Today, virtually no site respects ""do not track"" requests coming from web browsers. The only major company that honors the signals is Twitter.  Yahoo, which was one of the first companies to respect ""do not track"" signals, announced last month that it would no longer do so. Part of the company's turnaround strategy depends on personalizing its services and advertising, which requires - you guessed it - tracking you across the web. ""As the first major tech company to implement Do Not Track, we've been at the heart of conversations surrounding how to develop the most user-friendly standard,"" Yahoo wrote in a blog post. ""However, we have yet to see a single standard emerge that is effective, easy to use and has been adopted by the broader tech industry."" Officials at Yahoo, Google and Facebook all stressed that they offered their users various other tools to limit the amount of tracking that occurred when users wandered to other sites. Microsoft said Ms. Harris's guidance on best practices would be helpful as companies interpreted the California law. ""We appreciate the willingness to engage industry in developing some of the thinking,"" the company said in a statement. But a simple, one-click method of opting out of web tracking remains elusive.    The crux of the problem is that no one agrees on what ""do not track"" actually means. ""It's like I give you a dollar, and you decide what a dollar is worth to you,"" said Lee Tien, a senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group that has closely followed the debate. Most sites assume that you're fine with being tracked while you're on the site. If you're on Facebook, for example, the company figures you are comfortable with it knowing what you do while you're there. But beyond that, it gets murky fast. Does ""do not track"" mean that Facebook shouldn't follow you to other sites to show you ads based on what it knows about you? Does it mean that Facebook should stop the tracking needed so that its users can visit a news site and click a button to like or share an article with their Facebook friends? The Digital Advertising Alliance, which encompasses virtually every company involved in online advertising, is working on its own ""do not track"" technology that would apply only to tracking for ad purposes.  ""Other than for some limited exemptions, it would stop the creation of dossiers of the sites you've visited,"" said Stuart Ingis, a partner at the Venable law firm and counsel to the alliance. But he said sites would still be able to figure out that you were shopping for a new car, for example, based on other information, so it's not clear what exactly would be blocked. Nor is it clear whether this effort, too, will even see the light of day. ""It might never come out,"" Mr. Ingis said. ""We're trying to get consensus. It's a very broad industry."" In the meantime, what can you do to protect your privacy online?  At the most extreme end, you can turn off all cookies, the little bits of software that companies drop into your web browsers that do everything from remembering your login for a specific site to tracking your every move on the web.  Be warned: Many sites won't operate properly with all cookies blocked. But if you want to do it anyway, Wikihow has a handy illustrated guide for how to adjust your settings on each of the major browsers, or you can search the help pages within your particular browser.  If you are mostly concerned about the tracking being used to deliver personalized advertising, the ad industry has created a page where you can opt out of tracking by participating companies. However, the site is slow and buggy, and I've found that even when I opt out, some companies quickly start tracking me again. Third-party tools likeAdblock Plus and Ghostery can also be helpful. To limit tracking that happens on individual sites like Google or Facebook, you can also visit their privacy pages and adjust your settings from there, to the extent they allow it. Mr. Tien's group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is working on its own solution. It recently released software called Privacy Badger that tries to selectively block tracking by the companies that the group finds the most objectionable. The tool is still in testing, however, and many sites don't work properly when it's turned on.  One more thing: Most of the current ""do not track"" options don't apply to smartphones and mobile apps, which are becoming far more important paths to getting online. Tracking technology - and ways to block it - is much more nascent on mobile.  "
Federal Regulators Seek to Stop Sale of Students' Data,"Last month, ConnectEDU, a popular college and career planning portal in Boston that had collected personal details on millions of high school and college students, filed for bankruptcy. Now federal regulators want to stop the company from selling off students' names, email addresses, birth dates and other intimate information as assets. In a letter sent Thursday to the bankruptcy judge in the case, Jessica L. Rich, the director of the bureau of consumer protection at the Federal Trade Commission, argued that such a sale would violateConnectEDU's own privacy policy, a potentially deceptive practice.   The company's privacy policy states that, in the event of a sale of the company, it ""will give users reasonable notice and an opportunity to remove personally identifiable data from the service.""  The ConnectEDU bankruptcy and potential sale of its databases come at a time of heightened concern over the bulk collection of student information by private education technology companies.  Over the last few years, a number of prominent education privacy experts, federal and state legislators, consumer advocates and parents have warned that the data-mining practices of educational technology firms are eclipsing longstanding federal protections for student information.  ""Information about teens is particularly sensitive and may warrant even greater privacy protections than those accorded to adults,"" Ms. Rich wrote in the letter. ""These users, as well as their parents, would likely be concerned if their information transferred without restriction to a purchaser for unknown uses."" ConnectEDU did not immediately respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. An email sent to press@connectedu.com resulted in an error message. A federal law, called the Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act, or FERPA, generally requires schools to obtain consent from parents before sharing their children's educational records. But an exception allows schools to outsource school functions - like school busing, or data storage and analysis - to outside companies. Issues surrounding students' rights to access and control their own personal information have become more prominent over the last few months. Under fire from parents and privacy advocates, inBloom, a nonprofit student data repository largely financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, announced last month that it was closing. Parents and privacy advocates had raised objections to its plans to collate and streamline disparate academic, attendance and disciplinary data on behalf of schools.  Google last month also announced month that it would halt ad-scanning in Gmail in its Google Apps for Education product, a response to scrutiny it received for scanning student email for potential targeting of advertisements. And two weeks ago, two prominent federal senators announced that they intended to amend the education privacy law to give parents and their children greater control over the proliferation of students' personal details. The issues raised by the bankruptcy of ConnectEDU are likely to provide more ammunition for the senators' effort to amend the law. Founded in 2002, ConnectEDU developed college and career-planning sites where students could create personal listings; detail their academic achievements and interests; build resumes; and interact with teachers, mentors and potential employers.  It registered more than 20 million students as well as 5,000 educational institutions and 130,000 employers in 40 countries, according to the company's website.  Among them, more than 140 schools and districts in Massachusetts signed up for a special state portal, developed by ConnectEDU, the site said. In her letter to the bankruptcy judge, Ms. Rich of the F.T.C. recommended either that ConnectEDU give each student who had registered for its sites the choice to remove his or her personal records from company databases in advance of a sale -- or that the company destroy the entirety of the personal details it had collected.

Irish Regulator Finds Himself at Heart of Privacy Debate,"BERLIN - Billy Hawkes might be the most important tech regulator you've never heard of. When Mr. Hawkes took over in 2005 as Ireland's data protection commissioner, he said, it was a relatively quiet job focused on local issues. But in the years since, Ireland has become a preferred spot for giant tech companies to place their international headquarters, largely because of the country's low corporate tax rates. That has put Mr. Hawkes at the center of a growing debate over how these companies use people's online data.  Mr. Hawkes is tasked with handling privacy complaints about any company based in Ireland, leaving him responsible for protecting around a billion Internet users - both European citizens and those further afield. ""The biggest change is the number of controversial companies that fall under my remit,"" said Mr. Hawkes, who will step down from his role later this year. ""It's a shift from a domestic to an international focus."" The role of Ireland's data protection regulator is set to expand even further under proposed privacy changes in Europe expected to be approved next year. The legislation will allow companies that meet the data protection requirements in one European Union country to operate freely across the Continent. Now, companies like Microsoft and Google have to comply with regulators in each of the union's 28 member states, which often take different [#x200b]views on how local privacy rules should be enforced. While European lawmakers are still negotiating the details, legal experts expect the Irish data regulatory authority to be the main port of call for privacy complaints against American tech companies, as many of their international headquarters are based in Ireland. For Mr. Hawkes, the changes will put an increased burden on his 30-person staff and his annual budget of less than $3 million. (The Irish government has pledged extra money to meet the expected surge in regulatory challenges.) The new rules also will most likely add to scrutiny of his decisions. Some privacy advocates in Europe already say that Ireland's authority takes a lax view toward protecting individuals' online information compared with others, including those in Germany and France. ""At the back of this debate is a resentment of the Irish tax regime,"" said the soft-spoken Mr. Hawkes, who disputed the accusations that Ireland had a light touch on policing privacy concerns. ""I am faced with the paradox of devoting a huge amount of resources to international companies that have little impact on Irish residents."" The reputation of Mr. Hawkes and the Irish data protection authority has come under pressure after a lengthy legal challenge from Max Schrems, an Austrian who complained that Facebook routinely broke Europe's strict data privacy rules. The case centered on allegations by Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency, that the American intelligence agency gained access to large amounts of user data from companies, including Facebook. Mr. Schrems, who previously brought successful privacy complaints against Facebook in Ireland, said that the N.S.A.'s activities breached European privacy rules, but the Irish data protection regulator declined to investigate. Mr. Schrems is challenging that ruling in the Irish courts, and a decision to review his accusations could be made as early as next month. Mr. Hawkes says that despite cases like Mr. Schrems's, his office has taken steps to improve how American tech companies monitor the online data of both European and global users. His office has the ability to shut down companies that do not comply with Ireland's data rules, but it cannot fine companies for wrongdoing. In 2011, his office reviewed Facebook's privacy settings in response to complaints about the company's stance towards data protection. The Irish authority, which has responsibility for all of Facebook's data outside of North America, forced the social network to make its terms and conditions clearer and to give users greater control over how their information is used. Now, Mr. Hawkes says, his team is planning similar audits of Apple, Adobe and Yahoo, which have offices in Ireland. The investigations do not necessarily mean that the companies have breached local [#x200b]privacy rules, he added. ""Data protection will simply have to be higher up the corporate agenda,"" Mr. Hawkes said. ""We're trying to domesticate these international companies.""                       "
Apple's Serious Security Issue: Update Your iPhone or iPad Immediately,"This week, Apple rushed out a patch for its iOS 7 and iOS 6 operating systems to fix a serious security issue. Before I explain further, let me just say this: If you've gotten the prompt to update and you haven't, do it now. If you're still running older versions of iOS on your iPhone, iPod, or iPad, update now.  Done? O.K., good. While you're at it, go download either Chrome or Firefox for your Mac, and stop using Safari immediately until you see a security update for OS X Mavericks, as well. In a nutshell, Apple has a security hole in both its mobile and desktop operating systems that could let a malicious hacker jump in on what you think is a secure Web transaction if you're on a public Wi-Fi network like those at a coffee shop, airport or some other location. The vulnerability affects SSL/TLS, or Secure Socket Layer and Transport Layer Security. These are the two technologies that supposedly encrypt the conversation between your browser and the server you're trying to access when you visit a website. They're represented by an ""https"" rather than ""http"" in your browser's URL bar, and they're supposed to mean you've got a secure browsing session in effect. In fact, thanks to this bug, it's very possible you don't. The problem lies in validating the security certificates that are sent back and forth when you're establishing a secure connection. Thanks to this flaw, your browser can't verify the authenticity of an encryption certificate, meaning someone could easily be pretending to be your bank's website, your doctor's office site or a credit card application form. There are excellent posts here and here about the severity, technicalities and potential of the vulnerability. The update to iOS fixes the problem, but as of now, it's still an issue on OS X Mavericks (although it may not exist in earlier versions of the operating system) for Macintosh computers. There's a workaround on your Mac, though - use an alternative browser and avoid public Wi-Fi hotspots until there is a fix. That method won't work on an iPhone, iPad or iPod, because alternatives like Chrome for iOS use the same security background as Safari. Yes, by the way, people are deeply suspicious of both the timing of when this bug appeared and how it got there, in light of recent revelations about spying activity by the National Security Agency. I've also spoken to one engineer who said the errant line of code that caused the security hole could easily have been a copy/paste error that would have been extremely hard to detect. In today's environment, I tend to assume the worst, but the important thing now is to download the patch, watch for the Mavericks fix, and as usual, trust no one.  "
Poodle Bug Marks Third Major Security Flaw Discovered This Year,"First there was Heartbleed, then Shellshock, and now Poodle, yet another serious security vulnerability in yet another widely used piece of software that went unnoticed for years. This time, the Poodle vulnerability - which stands for Padding Oracle On Downloaded Legacy Encryption - was found in a 15-year-old web encryption technology called SSL 3.0. SSL, which stands for Secure Socket Layer, is the technology that encrypts a user's browsing session, making it difficult for anyone using the public Wi-Fi at Starbucks, for instance, to eavesdrop. The Poodle bug makes it possible for hackers to hijack their victim's browsing session and do things like take over their email, online banking, or social networking account.  Three researchers at Google, Bodo Möller, Thai Duong, Krzysztof Kotowicz, disclosed details of a Poodle attack in a report last month.  Rumors of the bug have leaked over the last few days, prompting the OpenSSL Project, which develops the most widely used type of SSL encryption software, to publish the report on Tuesday. The advisory prompted makers of web browsers, and server software, as well as some technology companies, to disable support for SSL 3.0. Poodle marked the third major discovery of a bug in a widely used technology this year. In April, researchers uncovered Heartbleed, a bug that made it possible for attackers to steal data from a server, including the keys to decode any encrypted contents. Then, last month, researchers uncovered Shellshock,a more serious bug that made it possible for hackers to take control of millions of machines around the world, unnoticed. Security researchers say that the Poodle bug is more innocuous than Heartbleed or Shellshock. For one, they note that SSL 3.0 has been largely superseded by a newer encryption protocol called Transport Layer Security, or TLS. Also, to pull off an a Poodle attack, security researchers say that the victim has to be actively online and physically close to the attacker - say, using the same public Wi-Fi. ""Poodle requires a specific physical location and an active connection before an attack is practical,"" said Karl Sigler, the threat intelligence manager at the security company Trustwave. On Tuesday, Microsoft advised users to disable SSL 3.0 on Windows for servers and PCs.  Bodo Möller, one of the three Google researchers who discovered the bug, suggested a workaround on Google's blog to secure web servers, but added that Google would remove support for SSL 3.0 from future customer software. Mozilla said it would disable SSL 3.0 in the next version of the Firefox browser, which it plans to release on Nov. 25, and suggested browsers and websites turn off the feature in the meantime. Other companies, like Twitter, said they had disabled support for SSL 3.0 and that some users may need to update their browsers to use the service.                       "
Tech Security Upstarts Enter Fray,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Steve Bennett, the chief executive of the computer security company Symantec, is spoiling for a fight. Symantec is still, by a pretty long stretch, the biggest in a growing pack of tech security companies. But like Microsoft, Mr. Bennett's company is sometimes viewed as an aging, if still wealthy, outfit that can't keep up with a new generation. And no one in the technology industry likes being labeled the old, slow rich guy. Particularly when $67 billion is up for grabs. That's how much companies were expected to spend last year on computer security. But younger outfits with names like FireEye and Palo Alto Networks are now competing with Symantec and its longtime rival McAfee, which is now part of Intel, for a greater share of a market that is expected to swell to $87 billion by 2016, according to Gartner, a research firm.  The pitch from the new companies is simple: Conventional security defenses -- like those that the antivirus software of Symantec and McAfee built their brands upon, as well as the network firewalls of Check Point and Cisco -- have proved vulnerable to determined adversaries. The biggest problem with that older technology, they say, is that it reacts to threats rather than anticipating them. The young companies say they can help solve that problem, which the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington estimates costs the United States economy $100 billion a year, and they're getting ready for a long fight with the established companies. ''More so in security than in other areas, companies are willing to buy from smaller start-ups,'' said Asheem Chandna, a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners who has invested in several security start-ups. ''They want the new, shiny mousetraps.'' Take FireEye. This month, the company announced that it had acquired Mandiant, another young firm, for $1 billion in stock and cash. The deal combines two darlings of this new generation of security -- one that detects attacks by examining Internet traffic for potential threats before they hit a network, and another that responds to threats and tries to make sure they don't happen again. FireEye is run by Dave DeWalt, who used to be McAfee's chief executive. ''Antivirus products are not working right now,'' Mr. DeWalt said in a recent interview. ''Companies are spending tens of billions of dollars of their money on a model that doesn't work.'' This fight between new and old has led to an unusually fragmented market, with 50 or so competitive companies, said Lawrence Pingree, a security analyst at Gartner. In 2012, Symantec led the security software market, with 19.6 percent of it, followed by McAfee's 8.8 percent, according to Gartner. Once the final numbers are tallied for 2013, Mr. Pingree said, he expects the incumbents will have ceded ground to the upstarts. The problem with traditional antivirus technology is that security researchers, like medical researchers, must study a virus before they can create the antidote. They have to capture a computer virus, dissect it and identify its signature -- unique signs in its code -- before they can write a program to block it. That process can take as little as a few minutes or as long as several years. Once a virus gets blocked, it is often left to the customer to run frequent software updates. And even then, it takes just a few tweaks to the code for criminals to outwit the system. ''We believe the antivirus market is hopelessly behind in being able to address the most acute problems,'' said Nir Zuk, the founder and chief technology officer at Palo Alto Networks. ''That is not where the action is and that is not where the majority of the money is going to be.'' Venture capitalists are also backing firms that help companies deal with the security issues created by employees who insist on using their own smartphones or computers on the company network -- the bring your own device dilemma. Last year, Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital invested in Skyhigh Networks, a start-up that helps companies keep an eye on apps downloaded to corporate networks through those rogue devices. Accel Partners, Khosla Ventures and others are betting on another start-up, called Lookout, which started out as a smartphone app and is now targeting corporate customers worried about the problem. Investors are also keen on start-ups like OpenDNS, which tries to identify suspicious Internet traffic patterns. The company was able to pre-emptively block malware hidden in Yahoo ads last month after it identified dangerous traffic coming from a small Internet service provider. ''We take a satellite view of the Internet,'' said David Ulevitch, OpenDNS's founder. ''We don't wait for the shots to get fired, then analyze the bullet.'' Even among the antivirus makers themselves, ''antivirus'' has become something of a dirty word. Symantec and McAfee are aggressively rebranding and investing in new sorts of technology. Notably, ''antivirus'' does not appear once on either company's home page. ''Everybody still talks about us as antivirus,'' said Mr. Bennett, the Symantec chief. ''We have more advanced threat protection in our portfolio than anybody else.'' He said the key to Symantec's plans was integrating all the little pieces, from antivirus software to systems that monitor incoming Internet traffic, into one big package that can be more easily installed and controlled. In fact, he said, 50 percent of the threats Symantec blocked last year were not blocked by antivirus, but by the company's newer security protections. ''The reality is that no one security technology is good enough,'' said Mr. Pingree, the Gartner analyst. ''Hackers are always working to defeat the latest defense, and so you have to invest in defenses for the latest threat as well as every threat experienced in the past.'' Last week, Intel, which acquired McAfee in 2011, announced it was killing off the McAfee brand altogether, keeping only the company's red shield logo intact. McAfee will now be known as Intel Security. Analysts say the move is an apparent effort to separate the brand from its antivirus roots and from its founder, John McAfee, who has gained notoriety for behavior that, at last count, included going on the lam after his neighbor in Belize was found dead, an arrest in Guatemala, a deportation to Miami and, finally, an expletive-laced video featuring Mr. McAfee trying to uninstall McAfee software while surrounded by scantily clad women, guns and ''bath salts.'' ''Antivirus is not what we're focused on,'' Michael Fey, McAfee's chief technology officer, said in an interview this week. ''It's fun for younger companies to point fingers, but that's not even where we get the bulk of our revenue.'' McAfee now makes more revenue selling newer network security and intrusion-prevention systems to its business customers, Mr. Fey said. ''We're proud of our antivirus -- it is a valuable solution that catches hundreds of thousands of issues a day for companies -- but under no circumstances do we think that is the future of security.'' And if you can't beat them, buy them. Last year, for example, Cisco spent $2.7 billion to acquire Sourcefire, an upstart security company. Mr. Chandna of Greylock, for one, expects to see a lot more of those big deals this year. One other thing the older companies can still do is compete on price. Last week, McAfee announced that it would begin giving away its mobile security products. ''We're running a marathon, not a sprint,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''When we're at the end of the finish line, sometime in the future, we're going to be there and we're going to be smiling. And we'll see where all these shiny-new-object companies are.'' "
Chinese Tech Company Kingsoft Seeks U.S. Listing for Mobile Subsidiary,"HONG KONG - The latest Chinese technology company to seek a stock market listing in the United States comes with heavyweight backers and is a rare attempt at an offering by a parent company already listed in Hong Kong. On Thursday, Kingsoft Corporation, a Chinese software company listed in Hong Kong, announced that its subsidiary, Cheetah Mobile, had filed for an initial public offering in the United States. Cheetah, which develops Internet security software, said in a filing on Wednesday with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission that it may seek to raise $300 million, a figure that may change and was disclosed for the purpose of calculating registration fees. Cheetah did not indicate whether it planned to list on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.  Coming amid a number of tremendously successful Chinese technology I.P.O.s in the United States, Cheetah's planned offering stands out on several fronts. The company's biggest backers are Lei Jun - a billionaire software and smartphone entrepreneur who has been known to style himself after Steven P. Jobs, the founder of Apple - and Tencent, a Chinese online video game and social networking company with a market value of about $130 billion. It is also uncommon for a company listed in Hong Kong to seek a new listing for a business in the United States. In doing so, Cheetah plans to adopt a two-tiered shareholding structure that would give the company's founders a disproportionate say over the way the company is run. While Hong Kong's stock market regulators have frowned on such structures, similar arrangements are common in the United States, especially among technology companies such as Google, which is creating a new class of shares with no voting rights - or Facebook. Partly as a result of this stance, Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, has chosen the United States over Hong Kong for an I.P.O. that analysts expect will surpass Facebook's $16 billion offering two years ago. Cheetah has developed a number of mobile apps and computer programs that block viruses, remove unwanted files and generally improve security. It boasted a total of 329.5 million monthly active users as of December. Last year, it made a profit of 62 million renminbi, or about $10 million, on revenue of 750 million renminbi. Cheetah's I.P.O. consists of new shares representing a 15 percent stake. Based on the preliminary $300 million deal size, the offering would value the company at $2 billion - or about 200 times last year's earnings. Kingsoft, whose stake in Cheetah is to be diluted to 47 percent from 54 percent after the sale, trades in Hong Kong at about 42 times its historical earnings and has a market value of just under $5 billion. Mr. Lei, whose separate smartphone business, Xiaomi, is targeting sales of 60 million units this year and 100 million next year, personally owns about 27 percent of Kingsoft, meaning he stands to make a significant profit if the Cheetah I.P.O. goes ahead as planned. So too would Tencent, which began investing in Cheetah in 2011 and owns an 18 percent stake. Shares in Kingsoft have rallied, partly in anticipation of the planned sale of Cheetah. The stock has nearly quadrupled over the past 12 months and is up 40 percent so far this year. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse are the main underwriters of the deal.  "
British Court Rules in Favor of Electronic Surveillance,"LONDON -- The court that oversees Britain's intelligence agencies ruled Friday that electronic mass surveillance of people's cellphone and online communications, like the Prism program revealed by Edward J. Snowden, is legal. The ruling, on a complaint brought by privacy advocates and rights groups like Amnesty International, is one of the first by a high-level court in any case linked to revelations by Mr. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor. But it is unlikely to end the debate over whether intelligence agencies should have access to online communications. The decision came after a global outcry against surveillance programs like Prism, which give American and British intelligence agencies almost unfettered access to Internet communications without individuals' knowledge.  The privacy groups said they would appeal the British court's decision at the European Court of Human Rights, which would move the deliberations to the Continent, where citizens' digital privacy rights are generally afforded higher protection than in Britain. Other lawsuits have also been filed against the use of these surveillance programs, including a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the National Security Agency in the United States that was dismissed last year because of security concerns. The British case was the first time that the country's intelligence agencies had openly defended the programs. Lawyers for Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, testified that the electronic spying was needed to protect Britons. Last month, one of Britain's top intelligence officials, Robert Hannigan, demanded in an opinion article in The Financial Times that American technology companies do more to help Western intelligence agencies combat the threat from terrorists and online criminals. The groups that brought the lawsuit, which also include Privacy International and Liberty, said the data collection programs used by Britain's intelligence agencies violated the country's human rights laws. They also criticized the court for keeping secret many of the rules governing the collection practices. But after hearing months of legal arguments, the British court ruled that the programs were legal and that there were enough safeguards in place to protect people's online privacy. ''The 'Snowden revelations' in particular have led to the impression voiced in some quarters that the law in some way permits the intelligence services carte blanche to do what they will,'' the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which handles cases involving Britain's intelligence agencies, said in its ruling. ''We are satisfied that this is not the case.'' The privacy groups disagreed. ''Today's decision by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal that this is business as usual is a worrying sign for us all,'' Eric King, deputy director at Privacy International, said in a statement on Friday. ''The idea that previously secret documents can justify this scale of intrusion is just not good enough.'' The case involved the activities of the N.S.A. and its British counterpart, GCHQ, which collected data from phone applications that revealed location, age and other personal information, according to British intelligence documents. During the proceedings, many of the GCHQ's techniques, including malware that allowed the British government to turn on computer microphones and cameras without the owners' consent, were made public for the first time. While the court ruled Friday that the intelligence activities at issue did not violate British law, it raised concerns that previous efforts to intercept some people's communications might prove to be illegal. That could include efforts to indiscriminately collect information on people's online communications without a specific reason to do so, it said. ''We have left open for further argument the question as to whether prior hereto there has been such a breach,'' the court decision said. Many privacy experts said the European Court of Human Rights, which will not hear the appeal before late 2015 at the earliest, would probably show more sympathy for the concerns voiced by groups like Amnesty International. The British court ''seems very reassured by the system of safeguards that are in place, although some have been kept secret,'' said Ian Brown, a professor of information security and privacy at Oxford. ''In general, European courts are usually less reassured.'' "
"Bank and Brokerage Accounts Are Prey to Hackers, Too","Data breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus were certainly scary. Personal information from tens of millions of people fell into the hands of cybercriminals. But an equally threatening and perhaps more personal attack is a hacker getting into your email and then using it to take money from your bank and brokerage accounts. It is a problem that is increasing at all wealth levels, from individuals with small investment accounts to family offices that serve the wealthiest clients. Naureen Hassan, senior vice president of client experience at Charles Schwab, which is the largest custodian of independent advisers in the country, said the firm had seen a fivefold increase in email-related fraud over the last two years. ''The biggest type of fraud we see is the fraudster takes over the person's email, and emails the adviser asking for urgent money,'' Ms. Hassan said. ''The other problem is related to clients storing signed pieces of paper in their email, which allows fraudsters to forge their signature.''  One of the better-known cases involved a client of GW & Wade, a Focus Financial Partners firm in Wellesley, Mass., that manages about $4 billion. The firm, which settled in October with the Securities and Exchange Commission, sent $290,000 of a client's money in three separate wires to a foreign bank, in response to a hacker sending emails from the client's account requesting the transfers. The S.E.C. accused GW & Wade of not having adequate safeguards to prevent the thefts and fined it $250,000 for executing the transfers. In its censure of the firm, the agency required it to take remedial steps to increase data security. ''When alerted to the situation, we took immediate action and ensured our client was never at financial risk,'' Neil Goldberg, a principal of the firm, said in a statement. ''Since then, we have put into place both new systems and procedures to prevent any similar occurrence.'' While GW & Wade ended up being penalized financially and took a reputational hit, its mistake served as a warning to other independent advisers eager to respond to client requests. A client of a Boston adviser said that he and his wife were traveling in Asia in the fall when their account was hacked and emails were sent to everyone at the adviser's firm who had ever emailed him, asking for a wire transfer. He said the adviser tried to contact him, unsuccessfully, and then reached out to his son to let him know what was happening. ''They read my emails, and they mimicked my tone for requests for money,'' said the man, a retired financial services executive who requested anonymity. ''The whole system appeared to be more sophisticated than these notes from Nigeria.'' The Nigerian prince email swindle, in which a supposed royal offers riches in exchange for a bank account number, is to today's phishing scams what a Brother word processor from the 1980s is to a MacBook. A security executive at a trust company told of a hacker who got creative in trying to fool the firm. The executive, who requested anonymity, said the firm received an email from a client's account asking that $137,000 be wired to Italy to buy some art. He said this client was part of a large family that traveled frequently, so the request was not odd on its face. But he said the family had put a procedure in place in which no wires went out without a call being made to the person requesting the money. The executive said clients can be frustrated by this level of bureaucracy, until someone they know gets hacked. ''Once it's happened to one of their family members,'' he said, ''it's amazing how they're much more accommodating.'' This is where the solution to a sophisticated swindle can sometimes be the simple action most people would take if a stranger knocked on their door at night: They would not answer it. ''I called my wealth manager and said, 'If I emailed you to wire $25,000 to a third party or someone with the same last name as me, what do you do?' '' said Ken Springer, a former F.B.I. agent who is now president of Corporate Resolutions, an investigations firm. ''He said they would want to get a verbal confirmation, and they'll document what phone number I used. Most reputable firms require that.'' It wouldn't hurt to ask the same question of your wealth manager. Where some advisers slip up, though, is in thinking they have received several levels of verification when they have not. ''An email with an attached, signed letter is not enough because it's all the same communication,'' said Jeffrey R. Bedser, founder and chief executive of iThreat Cyber Group. ''That's not two forms, that's one communication. There should always be a secondary verification.'' Beyond employing offline common sense, individuals need to be vigilant about how they use technology and the systems their advisers have to prevent their accounts from being hacked, or, if they are hacked, to keep their money from being transferred. A common area where security breaches occur is an unsecured public wireless network, say in a coffee shop or park. People who commit fraud set up fake hot spots that will still give you access to the Internet but will capture everything you do on the swindler's computer. Another mistake is using your email address as your login for any banking or investment account. ''You're giving hackers half the battle,'' said Bill Wyman, chief executive of Summitas, a firm that builds encrypted communications portals for financial services companies. Yet while technology can secure data both on computers and in transit, Mr. Wyman said, it is limited by what clients will tolerate. ''It's balancing ease of use with security,'' he said. ''Some clients will say 'I don't care,' and have liberal agreements. Some are very strict and have no leeway.'' Ms. Hassan said that Schwab was completely revamping how its advisers wired money for clients. The system currently asks them if they talked to their clients before allowing a wire transfer to go through. The new policy will require clients to confirm any wire transfers from their accounts. If Schwab does not recognize a client's computer or if it has an unusual Internet Protocol address, she said, the new system calls the client with a code to complete the transaction. ''We thought there would be a barrier to this, but advisers are looking for help,'' Ms. Hassan said. While the hacking of Target and Neiman Marcus data has drawn a lot of attention to the issue, advisers say a money management firm without enough checks and balances is a more common risk for wealthy people. Todd Kesterson, director of family office services at the accounting firm Rothstein Kass and former chief financial officer for a family office, pointed to the case of Paul Fireman, the founder of Reebok, whose money manager stole $25 million from him -- even though he had paid the manager a high-six-figure salary, plus bonuses, for over 20 years. ''If it's a couple of employees who are doing all the movement of family money,'' Mr. Kesterson said, ''you need to have reviews done to tighten up internal controls.'' He said that at his firm, no fewer than four people have to see every invoice before it is paid. And if a request comes in to transfer money to a new vendor or account, the scrutiny is even greater. The risk of an inside job is not confined to the wealthiest. Mr. Springer of Corporate Resolutions said he was recently called by a small broker-dealer that suspected one of its employees had been moving money out of an account. He had -- by wiring $25,000 10 times in three months to a friend with the same last name as a client. While the employee was caught and fired, Mr. Springer said the firm chose to remain silent for fear of damaging its reputation. That desire for anonymity may be understandable, but it is keeping people from knowing more about how these networks are working. For individuals, the best hope is due diligence before fraud can occur. ''At the end of the day, it's about being proactive,'' Mr. Bedser of iThreat Cyber Group said. ''Choose banking and financial partners that have a more secure process that you're comfortable with. Do more monitoring yourself.'' "
China's President Will Lead a New Effort on Cybersecurity,"SHANGHAI -- President Xi Jinping is presiding over a new working group on cybersecurity and information security, China announced on Thursday, a sign that the Communist Party views the issue as one of the country's most pressing strategic concerns.  The government said Mr. Xi and two other senior leaders, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Liu Yunshan, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, would help draft national strategies and develop major policies in a field that might include protecting national secrets and developing digital defenses, among other goals. ''Efforts should be made to build our country into a cyberpower,'' Mr. Xi said in a statement released after the first meeting of the group on Thursday, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. The announcement comes as Mr. Xi is solidifying power, mounting a bold crackdown on corruption at the top of the Communist Party and pushing through overhauls aimed at strengthening and restructuring the country's economy. In his first year in office, Mr. Xi, 60, seems determined to signal that he is firmly in control, amassing powers that some analysts say hark back to Deng Xiaoping's tenure as the country's supreme leader. Late last year, Mr. Xi was named to head a leading working group on overall change and a state security committee that some experts say was inspired by the National Security Council, which advises American presidents. He has also presided over a government that has tightened control over the news media and Internet microblogs. The high-profile group on cybersecurity and so-called informatization could be aimed at grappling with one of the thornier issues that emerged in Mr. Xi's first year in office: disputes with the United States over cyberattacks and debates over national security leaks. The Obama administration has strongly challenged China over the past few years to curb what it contends are Chinese cyberattacks on Americans and American companies doing business in China. Among the concerns is that Chinese hackers, possibly state sponsored, have been stealing corporate and national secrets. Beijing has responded that it, too, has been a frequent victim of cyberattacks, many originating in the United States. The Chinese government has also insisted that it opposes hacking in any form. The issue was one of the most delicate that came up in June when Mr. Xi joined President Obama for a summit meeting at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, Calif. Analysts say the talks between the two powers have grown more complicated since revelations that the National Security Agency has engaged in widespread spying around the world, even against American allies. Experts say the issue has major implications for large corporations in the United States and China, which could find themselves blocked from doing business in the other country in areas like telecommunications or Internet security. China now has the world's second-largest economy, after the United States, and the largest number of Internet users, more than 600 million. But Chinese authorities complain that the country's science and technology abilities lag far behind those of more developed countries. The government announcement on Thursday did not offer details about what cybersecurity and informatization would cover, but the government made clear that it was determined to strengthen its abilities. ''No Internet safety means no national security,'' Mr. Xi said Thursday. ''No informatization means no modernization.'' "
China Plans Security Checks for Tech Firms After U.S. Indictments,"HONG KONG -- A Chinese state agency that threatened retaliation after the United States obtained indictments of five People's Liberation Army officers on charges of cyberespionage announced plans on Thursday for tighter checks on Internet technology companies that do business in China. The agency, the State Internet Information Office, said the Chinese government would establish new procedures to assess potential security problems with Internet technology and services used by sectors ''related to national security and the public interest,'' reported Xinhua, the state-run news agency.  The announcement came three days after United States prosecutors laid out charges against the five Chinese military officers, accusing them of stealing sensitive commercial information over the Internet to benefit Chinese state companies. The indictment drew harsh denunciations from the Chinese government. The proposed vetting rules appear to have been under preparation for some time, but the timing of their unveiling is unlikely to be mere chance, said Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, which advises investors on the Chinese high-tech and Internet sectors. ''I don't think any of these things are coincidence in terms of this particular topic, because they're looking for retaliatory measures,'' Mr. Clark said in a telephone interview from Beijing. ''But already, especially since Edward Snowden's accusations, they've been increasingly concerned about Internet security.'' The procedures will ''stipulate Internet security assessments for important Internet information technology products and their suppliers entering the Chinese marketplace,'' Xinhua reported, citing Jiang Jun, a spokesman for the State Internet Information Office. The move is intended to ''prevent product suppliers illegally controlling, interfering in or interrupting user systems, or illegally collecting, storing, handling or exploiting information about users,'' Xinhua said. ''Products and services that do not meet security requirements will be excluded from use in China,'' Xinhua said. Disclosures by Mr. Snowden, the former National Security Agency consultant, about the scale of United States intelligence gathering over the Internet showed that ''without cybersecurity, there can be no national security,'' said Mr. Jiang. ''The vetting will focus on I.T. products and services used in communications, finance, energy and other key industries that concern national security and public interests,'' Li Jingchun, an engineer with China's National Research Center for Information Technology Security, told Xinhua. The companies affected could include Cisco Systems, IBM and Microsoft, suggested a commentary about the new policy on the website of China Daily, a state-run newspaper. The new procedures may oblige such companies to share sensitive data and technology, like encryption processes, a demand that has been a source of trade and commercial friction with China in the past, said Mr. Clark. ''It could be quite broad,'' he said. ''We have the equipment layer, we have the software lawyer, but we also have lots of applications and encryption.'' The move is potentially a major headache for companies that sell Internet hardware and services in China, especially to arms of the government. The reports suggested that such foreign companies were colluding with espionage and illegal data collection agencies. ''The foreign companies are already being hit really hard,'' said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for APCO Worldwide, who advises companies on investment and dealing with government in China. ''It was getting tough already, but since Snowden it's gotten tougher.'' On Monday, the Justice Department unsealed an indictment that named five members of the People's Liberation Army and charged them with breaking into the networks of Westinghouse Electric, the United States Steel Corporation and other companies to obtain information about technology, commercial negotiations and trade disputes. The latest reported comments from the State Internet Information Office did not describe the security checks as retaliation for the indictments. But on Tuesday, an official from the same office, who did not give his name, raised that threat. ''The United States' indictment of five Chinese military officers over so-called cybertheft is pure nonsense, an entirely false accusation, and it is a case of a thief yelling 'stop thief,' '' said the spokesman, according to a report from Xinhua. ''If the United States continues to willfully pursue its own course, China will take measures to resolutely counterattack.'' The Internet in China, and companies who do business with it, are already under the regulation of a plethora of state and Communist Party agencies. The State Internet Information Office was established in 2011 to ''supervise online content management and handle administrative approval of businesses related to online news reporting,'' a report at the time said.

Do You Wish You Had More Privacy Online?,"Personal space can be defined as the physical distance from other people that feels safe and healthy. But it also describes the amount of information about your life that feels comfortable for sharing with others, either in person or online. Do you like the amount of personal space you have online and in face-to-face interactions? If not, what would you change about the privacy you have? Why?  In the Opinion essay ""We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing"" Kate Murphy considers the way our perception of online privacy shapes us as individuals: Imagine a world suddenly devoid of doors. None in your home, on dressing rooms, on the entrance to the local pub or even on restroom stalls at concert halls. The controlling authorities say if you aren't doing anything wrong, then you shouldn't mind. Well, that's essentially the state of affairs on the Internet. There is no privacy. If those creepy targeted ads on Google hadn't tipped you off, then surely Edward J. Snowden's revelations, or, more recently, Jennifer Lawrence's nude selfies, made your vulnerability to cybersnooping abundantly clear. You need only read George Orwell's ""1984"" or watch the film ""Minority Report"" to understand how surveillance is incompatible with a free society. And increasingly, people are coming to understand how their online data might be used against them. You might not get a job, a loan or a date because of an indiscreet tweet or if your address on Google Street View shows your brother-in-law's clunker in the driveway. But less obvious is the psychic toll of the current data free-for-all. ""With all the focus on the legal aspects of privacy and the impact on global trade there's been little discussion of why you want privacy and why it's intrinsically important to you as an individual,"" said Adam Joinson, professor of behavior change at the University of the West of England in Bristol, who coined the term ""digital crowding"" to describe excessive social contact and loss of personal space online. ... So it's not surprising that privacy research in both online and offline environments has shown that just the perception, let alone the reality, of being watched results in feelings of low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. Whether observed by a supervisor at work or Facebook friends, people are inclined to conform and demonstrate less individuality and creativity. Their performance of tasks suffers and they have elevated pulse rates and levels of stress hormones. An analogy in the psychological literature is that privacy is like sleep. Just as being unconscious for a portion of the day is restorative, so is being unselfconscious. The arousal associated with being observed and the implicit judgment drain cognitive resources. We worry about how we are perceived, which inhibits our ability to explore our thoughts and feelings so we can develop as individuals. A three-year German study ending in 2012 showed that the more people disclosed about themselves on social media, the more privacy they said they desired. The lead author of the study, Sabine Trepte, a professor of media psychology at the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart, said the paradox indicated participants' dissatisfaction with what they got in return for giving away so much about themselves.  Students: Read the entire article, then tell us ... - How much privacy do you feel you have online and in real life? Is it the right amount? Explain. - What do you think of the study that concluded that people who share a lot of their lives online are more likely to say they want more privacy? Why? - Have you ever felt inhibited or frustrated with people who follow you on social media judging or otherwise keeping tabs on your words and actions?  - How does this compare with interactions in real life in which people are watching you as you go about your day? - Do you think it is possible to regain privacy once someone has shared a lot of personal information with other people? Why or why not?  Students 13 and older are invited to comment below. Please use only your first name. For privacy policy reasons, we will not publish student comments that include a last name. "
"Security Flaw Could Reach Beyond Websites to Digital Devices, Experts Say","When the Heartbleed bug was disclosed on Monday, the attention focused on the fallout for major Internet companies like Yahoo and Amazon. But security experts said the potential for harm could extend much further, to the guts of the Internet and the many devices that connect to it. By Thursday, some of the companies that make those devices began revealing whether they had been affected.  Cisco Systems, the dominant provider of gear to move traffic through the Internet, said its big routers and servers, as well as its online servers -- a big business -- were not affected. If they had been, that would have had a significant impact on virtually every major company that connects to the Internet. Certain products the company makes were affected, it said -- some kinds of phones that connect to the Internet, a kind of server that helps people conduct online meetings, and another kind of device used for office communications. Cisco also posted a list of products it had examined for the vulnerability, which it was updating as it continued inspecting its equipment. A Cisco rival, Juniper Networks, also said its main products were not affected. The only problem it found was in a kind of device for creating private communications on the Internet. ''Besides one product, the exposure for our customers is minimal, if any,'' said Michael Busselen, vice president of corporate communications at Juniper. Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, said his company had been looking through its products for vulnerabilities for several days and so far had found nothing. He said, however, that the search was not yet done. Qualcomm, a maker of mobile technology, said it was still checking its products. The Heartbleed flaw was found in the method known as OpenSSL that helps encrypt information on the Internet. For most people, the web -- with sites like Facebook and Google -- is the most visible part of the Internet. But hardware like home routers and printers is also connected to the Internet, and OpenSSL is built into some of this hardware. ''That's why this is so nasty,'' said George Kurtz, chief executive of CrowdStrike, a security firm. ''OpenSSL goes far beyond just websites. It's implemented in email protocols and all kinds of embedded devices.'' Most of the equipment made by Cisco and Juniper was unaffected because the companies did not use OpenSSL for their encryption. Security experts say personal home routers often incorporate OpenSSL, which could make them vulnerable. But they note that because many home routers are configured to block outside traffic, the risk of a hacker using the Heartbleed bug to lift data like passwords to online banking and email accounts is low. This is particularly so, they said, when there are still thousands of vulnerable websites where this data could be pulled from much more easily. Nevertheless, Mr. Kurtz said, users would be wise to check with their home router manufacturers to upgrade their devices if they want to be absolutely secure. Security researchers say that while hackers have been posting lists of vulnerable websites, there does not appear to have been an increase in black market sales of sensitive data, like passwords. Security experts say that upgrading and cleaning up those systems, if they are affected, could take years. ''It's one thing to get all of these servers at Yahoo, Google and everyone else fixed, but it's a whole other thing to get these embedded devices fixed up,'' Mr. Kurtz said. ''I don't see them getting updated any time soon.'' "
Keeping Up With Windows Update,"Keeping Up With Windows Q. What is Microsoft fixing every month when I get Windows Update notices on my PC? A. Those Windows Update notices usually contain Microsoft's latest security patches and improvements to its Windows operating system. The company tends to release all its non-emergency updates on the second Tuesday of every month, a day that has come to be known as Patch Tuesday, although additional updates during the month are not uncommon. Although it can be a bit technical, Microsoft posts information about its security updates at technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin if you want to find out what each patch is supposed to repair; the Microsoft Security Response Center blog at blogs.technet.com/b/msrc also has details. While the updates are intended to plug security holes and take care of other issues, the new code can sometimes break other programs.  If an application does not work properly after you have installed Windows updates, a quick web search (or a visit to the support forums for the affected program) may offer workarounds until yet another patch is issued. Scanning a Mac For Malware Q. My Mac has been acting weird, and I'm worried it might be because of spyware, although I'm not sure how I got it. How can I find out and remove it? A. Apple has a number of security features built into its OS X system, but it is still possible for malicious software to plague your Mac. Unexpected pop-up ads, fake security alerts and web pages that behave oddly are common symptoms of a malware infection. Apple has warned about the Flashback and Mac Defender malware that have targeted its systems and recommends that you download and install all the security patches available thought the Mac's Software Update tool, which is available under the Apple Menu. Although Macs have been targeted far less than Windows systems, malware can still invade through things like security flaws in Java or ''free'' programs from the web that also include spyware. If you suspect your Mac is infected, scan your system with security software from a reputable company. The independent institute AV Test has reviewed more than a dozen security programs for OS X, including paid programs like Bitdefender, as well as free utilities like those from Avast and Sophos. TIP OF THE WEEK Online productivity tools like Google Docs, Microsoft Office Online and Apple's iWork for iCloud beta are among the services that let you create and edit documents without having to pay for a dedicated word-processing program for your PC or Mac. However, if you do not always have an Internet connection, or would prefer to keep the files locally on your computers, both Windows and Mac OS X come with a built-in word processor that does much more than simple text editing. Microsoft's WordPad program (found in the Start menu's Accessories folder in Windows 7 or in the Windows Accessories area of the All Apps screen in Windows 8.1) uses a simpler version of the Ribbon toolbar similar to that in Microsoft Word. Documents created in WordPad can include embedded photos and graphics, bold and italic text styles and other formatting features like bulleted lists. Apple's TextEdit program for OS X lives in the Mac's Applications folder and offers similar formatting tools. In OS X 10.8 and later, the Mac's Dictation tool can be used to convert spoken words into type in TextEdit. While the standard Dictation software requires an Internet connection, the Enhanced Dictation program for OS X 10.9 and later works right on the Mac -- just turn on the Enhanced Dictation checkbox in the Dictation & Speech area of the System Preferences to download the necessary software.

Sidestepping the Risk of a Privacy Breach,"Twitter: @ronlieber This week, we reached the inevitable point in the controversy over the credit and debit card breaches where grim-faced retail executives from Target and Neiman Marcus, industry experts and consumer advocates turned up in Washington. They raised their hands and delivered well-rehearsed statements to our elected representatives. It's a familiar bit of theater, but their messages about the security of our personal data when we pay using plastic were startling. ''The innovations that are driving the industry forward and presenting consumers with exciting new methods of making purchases is also rapidly expanding beyond the bounds of our existing regulatory and consumer protection regimes,'' went the written testimony of James A. Reuter, speaking on behalf of the American Bankers Association. ''And, as has historically been the case, the criminals are often one step ahead as the marketplace searches for consensus.''  William Noonan of the Secret Service echoed this sentiment in his testimony, noting the rapid increase in the number of criminals trying to acquire financial information and the sophistication of their methods. That gave Mallory Duncan of the National Retail Federation plenty of cover to declare outright, ''Data breaches are a fact of life in the United States.'' This sounds a lot like resignation, though some of it is mere posturing as the various parties try to pass the buck and the bill for the damages. But if breaches are nearly inevitable for now, important questions arise: What are your odds of being swept up in all this, and how do you reduce them? First, some numbers. If you want a good scare, take a look at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse's interactive chronology of United States data breaches. A full search since the beginning of 2005 turns up 4,167 breaches that exposed 663,587,386 records of personal information. It is an incomplete list, perhaps by many millions, since thieves often extract information without victims ever knowing. Nevertheless, January's tally of instances in which data became vulnerable include the University of California, Davis health system, Snapchat, Coca-Cola, the message boards of the Straight Dope website, Skype, the Wichcraft sandwich chain, the federal Veterans Affairs Department and a county social worker in North Carolina who was supposed to be helping minors and disabled adults and instead stole personal information to aid an income tax fraud scheme. These are the facts of life to which Mr. Duncan referred. Javelin Strategy and Research released the results of its annual survey of criminal activity this week and found 13.1 million victims in the United States of what it calls identity fraud, which it defines as any unauthorized use of personal information for financial gain. This can include a $3 credit card charge that you did not authorize, and as with any survey, it relies on the memories and interpretations of a diverse array of individuals. The most eyebrow-raising numbers are the findings that 30.5 percent of people who were swept up in a breach of some sort in 2013 became victims of some kind of identity fraud. That is up from roughly 12 percent just three years ago, as criminals become better at stealing credit and debit card numbers and selling them quickly. If those figures are right, does that mean that of the 40 million credit and debit card numbers thieves sucked from Target's payments system, scofflaws will end up using more than 12 million of them successfully? Probably not. As with any breach, the thieves may not put all the card numbers up for sale. Buyers may not buy all the ones on the market and may not use everything they buy. Then there is the publicity, vigilance and pre-emptively canceled cards that resulted from the large numbers of people involved. ''For now, everyone is watching this like a hawk,'' said Al Pascual, Javelin's senior analyst of security, risk and fraud. But let's be real about the Target breach and similar ones where thieves get card numbers and, sometimes, email addresses. If you use a credit card to buy things, you're hopefully reading your statement carefully at least once a month. If a rogue purchase shows up, you call the card issuer, the issuer removes the purchase and that's usually the end of it. I often cross my fingers when this happens and keep the card, hoping to avoid the rigmarole of changing card numbers and resetting a bunch of automated monthly subscriptions and bills. Still, it's maybe two hours of work if it comes to that. Debit card users have bigger problems. Let's assume that if the thieves did manage to get encrypted PINs from Target, they were unable to crack the code (and withdraw money from A.T.M.'s). Any ordinary debit card purchase sucks the money from the user's checking account. Unless you're looking at your balances each day, you may not notice the illicit purchase right away. Once notified, your bank may take days to investigate and put the money back. Automated mortgage payments and other bills may bounce, causing a host of hassles and potential dings on your credit report. In a world of inevitable breaches, using a debit card for everyday purchases involves some risk. While it's great for budgeting, users need to check the account activity daily. It's also wise to have spare cash in a different account to draw on in case a big fraudulent charge leaves the other one temporarily short. Thieves who have both card numbers and email addresses may try to send messages, pretending to be from the card company, in an attempt to phish for additional information. The note might instruct you to click a link, which may lead to malware on your computer that can extract usernames and passwords and other information. Or you could end up at a site that resembles your bank's, where you may type in a bunch of personal data. If thieves can get your Social Security number, for instance, they may be able to open new accounts in your name. Sadly, the default assumption these days has to be that every email asking for personal information -- or really any electronic correspondence from a financial institution at all -- is fake. That seems extreme, but all it means is that if any of the notes are sounding alarms about your account, type in the web address of the company and look up its call center number. That way, you can talk to a representative who can tell you if the email warnings are legitimate. You think you would never fall for this, but people slip up. Verizon's most recent annual fright show of a report on data breaches around the world attributes 29 percent of them to this sort of people-to-people breach, at least in part. There is a bit of bribery and extortion in this category, but 77 percent of the social breaches happen through phishing. And while the person responsible for clicking the wrong link is often unknown, seasoned executives and managers are at least partly to blame 27 percent of the time. They tend to be the primary targets, but it's worth noting that cashiers, call center workers and guards are one of the links just 11 percent of the time. I anticipate messing this up sooner or later, which is why I have a security freeze on my credit files. As a result, only companies that I currently do business with can get access to my credit reports. Given that most entities will not open a new account without a credit check, it is the best defense that exists against the most troublesome form of identity theft, in which thieves try to establish new accounts in someone else's name. For a few bucks, I can temporarily lift the freeze when I want to apply for new lines of credit. Leading a cash-only life is a theoretical possibility, but it boxes you out of most online shopping and makes traveling difficult. Going cash-only mostly means endless trips to the A.T.M. and all the fees and hassle that come with it. So cards still offer more benefits than drawbacks for people who don't get into debt, even if the gap between the two seems to be narrowing. With the right tactics, however, it's easy enough for most people to greatly bolster their odds of avoiding the worst of the problems. "
"After an Uproar, European Regulators Question Facebook on Psychological Testing","Facebook could be in hot water with Europe's privacy regulators. The social network is facing potential investigations after it disclosed last week that it deliberately manipulated the emotional content of the news feeds by changing the posts displayed to nearly 700,000 users to see if emotions were contagious. The company did not seek explicit permission from the affected people -- roughly one out of every 2,500 users of the social network at the time of the experiment -- and some critics have suggested that the research violated its terms of service with its customers. Facebook has said that customers gave blanket permission for research as a condition of using the service.  In response to widespread public anger, several European data protection agencies are examining whether Facebook broke local privacy laws when it conducted the weeklong investigation in January 2012. That includes Ireland's Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, which regulates Facebook's global operations outside North America because the company has its international headquarters in Dublin. The Irish regulator has sent a series of questions to Facebook related to potential privacy issues, including whether the company got consent from users for the study, according to a spokeswoman. The Information Commissioner's Office of Britain also said that it was looking into potential privacy breaches that may have affected the country's residents, though a spokesman of the office said that it was too early to know whether Facebook had broken the law. It is unknown where the users who were part of the experiment were located. Some 80 percent of Facebook's 1.2 billion users are based outside North America. ''We're aware of this issue, and will be speaking to Facebook, as well as liaising with the Irish data protection authority, to learn more about the circumstances,'' a spokesman for the British regulator said in a statement. Neither regulator, however, has launched an official investigation into Facebook's practices. Earlier, the Financial Times reported that the British regulator had begun an investigation on the case. In the study, which lasted one week in January 2012, Facebook changed the number of positive and negative posts that some users saw in their feeds to gauge how emotions can affect social media. Richard Allan, Facebook's director of policy in Europe, said that it was clear that people had been upset by the study. ''We want to do better in the future and are improving our process based on this feedback,'' he said in a statement. ''The study was done with appropriate protections for people's information, and we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have.'' The Federal Trade Commission, the American regulator that oversees Facebook's conduct under a 20-year consent decree, has not publicly expressed similar interest in the case, which has caused an uproar over the company's ethics and prompted the lead researcher on the project to apologize. Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, addressed the study in India on Wednesday in a meeting with entrepreneurs and women to promote her book ''Lean In'' and in an interview with the Indian TV network NDTV. [Video: The NDTV interview with Ms. Sandberg. Watch on YouTube.] ''We clearly communicated really badly about this and that we really regret,'' Ms. Sandberg said in the NDTV interview. ''We do research in an ongoing way, in a very privacy protective way, to improve our services and this was done with that goal.'' Ms. Sandberg also expressed confidence that the company will weather any regulatory inquiries. ''We are in communication with regulators all over the world and this will be OK,'' she said in the interview. This is not the first time that Facebook has fallen foul of Europe's tough privacy rules. In 2011, the social network was forced to revamp its privacy settings after an audit by Ireland's regulator found that some of the company's policies did not meet Europe's data protection rules. Mark Scott contributed reporting from London. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Google Offers New Encryption Tool,"The National Security Agency's snooping is about to get more difficult. Google on Tuesday released the source code for a new extension to its Chrome browser that will make it a lot easier for users to encrypt their email. The tool, called End-to-End, uses an open-source encryption program, OpenPGP, that will allow users to encrypt their email from the time it leaves their web browser until it is decrypted by the intended recipient. It will also allow users to easily read encrypted messages sent to their web mail service. The tool will require that users and their recipients use End-to-End or another encryption tool to send and read the contents.  This could be a major blow to the N.S.A. Despite numerous cryptographic advances over the past 20 years, end-to-end email encryption like PGP and GnuPG is still remarkably labor-intensive and require a great deal of technical expertise. User mistakes - not errors in the actual cryptography - often benefited the N.S.A. in its decade-long effort to foil encryption. ""It's important that the government not overstep,"" Eric Grosse, Google's chief of security, said in an interview last week. ""We don't want any government breaking the security of the Internet."" Google's new tool may make the NSA and other intelligence agencies' jobs more difficult. While end-to-end encryption does not eliminate the potential for an attacker or government agency to read a target's messages, it forces them to hack directly into their computer to read messages rather than catching them in transit, or gathering them through a secret court order to their communications provider. Speaking by videoconference at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex., this year, Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, challenged technologists to offer easier end-to-end encryption, saying it would result in a ""more constitutional, more carefully overseen enforcement model."" Until now, technology companies have been hesitant to provide end-to-end encryption because it excludes companies like Google and Yahoo from gathering data from messages that can be sold for targeted advertising. None of the major technology providers have signed on to Dark Mail Alliance, a partnership announced last year by Silent Circle and Lavabit, two privacy-conscious communications providers, that offered companies like Microsoft, Google and Yahoo a new end-to-end encrypted email protocol. Privacy activists have criticized Google and other companies for not supporting end-to-end encryption sooner. ""Google wants to sit between you and everyone you interact with and provide some kind of added value,"" Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union, said on the SXSW panel with Mr. Snowden. ""They want to be in that connection with you, and that makes it difficult to secure those connections."" But Google's announcement on Tuesday showed that the company has heard those concerns. ""We recognize that this sort of encryption will probably only be used for very sensitive messages or by those who need added protection,"" Stephan Somogyi, a Google privacy and security product manager, wrote in a company blog post. ""But we hope that the End-to-End extension will make it quicker and easier for people to get that extra layer of security should they need it."" It will take more time for users to put End-to-End into effect. On Tuesday, Google released the early draft of its open source End-to-End code for cryptographers, privacy activists and engineers to inspect for mistakes and back doors. Google's bug bounty program, called its Vulnerability Reward Program, offers security researchers money if they find security bugs in the code, for End-to-End and other products. Separately, Google released new numbers on Tuesday in a report showing how far companies still need to go to secure user communications. Google automatically encrypts web traffic as it travels from its servers around the Internet, but if the communications provider on the other end does not also support encryption, then the communications aren't protected. Google said 40 to 50 percent of emails sent between Gmail and other email providers are not encrypted. Less than 1 percent of traffic between Google and Comcast is encrypted, for example, while more than 95 percent of traffic between Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist and Amazon remains encrypted. Charlie Douglas, a Comcast spokesman, said the company was currently testing encryption with large websites and email providers and planned to turn on encryption with Google in a matter of weeks. He said Comcast engineers would be on a conference panel next week to discuss best practices and road maps for switching on encryption with other email providers as well. ""We are supportive of, and want to drive adoption of, encryption,"" Mr. Douglas said. Microsoft, which announced earlier this year that it planned to switch on encryption by the end of the year, still has some work to do. Roughly only half the traffic between Google and Microsoft services like Hotmail stays encrypted. Google's data will no doubt be used by privacy activists to shame companies that do not support encryption. And indeed, on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Soghoian had already tweeted a link to Google's report. ""They name,"" he wrote. ""We shame.""                       "
Protecting Data From Its Snatchers,"LONDON -- When Ted Nelson published ''Computer Lib,'' a manifesto for putting computing power into the hands of the people, it was a radical proposition. In 1974, computers cost $5 million, were mostly funded by the Pentagon and filled an entire room. ''Saying that everyone should have a personal computer was like saying everyone should have a jumbo jet,'' said Nicco Mele, an expert on digital history at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Today, every iPhone is dramatically more powerful than a supercomputer in the 1970s.  Mr. Nelson was a hero to the founders of the digital age who came of age amid anti-Vietnam protests, the civil rights movement and a simmering distrust of the state. Bill Gates later bought the rights to Mr. Nelson's book, whose cult cover features a raised fist. Steve Jobs said he was inspired by it. The collision of America's countercultural movements with technology was a defining moment. The ethos of the early nerds was radically antiestablishment: They wanted to take power away from institutions and give it to individuals (and yes, make a lot of money in the process). Four decades later, the former revolutionaries have become billionaires and their companies are more powerful than many states. As the fallout from revelations of digital surveillance by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden continues, two stark questions have emerged: When it comes to data protection, whose side are companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter on? And how empowered, really, are we smartphone-carrying citizens? Companies have reacted to the public outcry over their role in mass spying by accelerating efforts to encrypt more data on phones and email systems. Many publish the number of requests from governments to hand over user data and argue that government agencies should have a warrant when demanding access to information. ''We've been put in the spotlight, but companies have actually made quite a lot of changes,'' said Richard Allan, Facebook's head of policy for Europe who uses Tor software, a system enabling its users to communicate anonymously on the Internet. ''I have yet to see governments undertake any meaningful transparency reforms.'' The finger-pointing is mutual: Last month, the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, criticized some encryption efforts, saying that the ''post-Snowden pendulum'' had ''gone too far.'' This month, Robert Hannigan, the newly appointed director of GCHQ, Britain's electronic spying agency, accused Internet companies of providing the ''command-and-control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals.'' Almost as striking as this very public broadside in a country that during the Cold War did not even acknowledge the existence of its various security services, was the lack of any acknowledgement that intelligence agencies themselves may have something to answer for, said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European Studies at the University of Oxford, who is working on a book on free speech. ''They are trying very hard to turn the searchlight of public scrutiny to the companies,'' he said. Pressing companies to cooperate more, Mr. Hannigan sought to reassure citizens about the safety of their data. But as Mr. Garton Ash put it, ''Snowden's strongest argument was Snowden himself: If they are so good at protecting our data, why are they so bad at it?'' If governments don't protect privacy, the only way to do it is to build security into the technology, said Gus Hosein, head of Privacy International, a London-based advocacy group. ''The tech companies are never going to be our friends -- their business model is the exploitation of user data,'' he said. ''But they are a very powerful pressure point to help us get what we want. We have to try to get them to act in the interest of users.'' The more Google and Facebook have become the establishment they once challenged, the more they themselves are vulnerable to the power they invested in individuals, said Mr. Mele, who last year published ''The End of Big,'' a book about what it means to live in a socially connected world. ''Facebook is terrified of competitors,'' he said. ''Remember MySpace? Or before that, Friendster? They were not demonstrably different from Facebook. And let's not forget that Facebook isn't really that profitable.'' Even Google, with its 67.6 percent share of the search engine market, faces rivals in Yahoo and even in upstart competitors like DuckDuckGo.com, which offers a more private, secure and user-friendly search experience. At a time when the Brazilian legislature is seriously considering laws that would effectively outlaw tech companies headquartered in the United States, for fear of complicity, and German government agencies are looking for alternative providers, could alliances yet shift in favor of privacy-conscious citizens caught between the twin superpowers of governments and companies? ''In terms of user power, it is most certainly there,'' Mr. Mele said. ''The question is: Will we use it?'' "
Gemalto to Pay $890 Million for Data Protection Firm,"LONDON - The Dutch digital security company Gemalto said on Friday that it had agreed to pay $890 million for SafeNet, a Maryland-based  provider of data protection software.  Gemalto's security products are used for mobile wallets and online banking and in some national identity cards and bank cards. Gemalto, which is based in Amsterdam, would acquire 100 percent of the share capital of SafeNet from the private equity firm Vector Capital. The purchase would be funded by cash and existing long-term debt facilities. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Olivier Piou, the Gemalto chief executive, said the deal would ""expand our technologies and growth opportunities in protecting online access."" SafeNet, based in Belcamp, Maryland, is a provider of digital information security software to banks, retailers, government agencies and others. Its software is used to protect more than 80 percent of the world's intra-bank transfers, SafeNet said. Founded in 1983, the company employs more than 1,500 employees and has a presence in 27 countries. It posted revenue of $337 million in 2013. ""The combination of our portfolios will allow customers to have access to world's leading security products for mobile and cloud, delivering best-in-class protection of data and identities,"" Prakash Panjwani, the SafeNet president and C.E.O., said in a news release. Gemalto employs more than 12,000 people in 44 countries. It posted revenue of 2.4 billion euros, or about $3.2 billion, last year. "
Target Vows to Speed Anti-Fraud Technology,"WASHINGTON -- A top executive of Target told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the company was accelerating plans to adopt a technology widely used in Europe but rare in the United States that reduces potential for credit card fraud, and lawmakers from both parties called on other businesses to do the same. The session, a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on privacy in the digital age, was the first time that executives from Target and Neiman Marcus had been subject to detailed public questioning about the detection and handling of the recent data security breaches that exposed the data of millions of customers. John J. Mulligan, Target's chief financial officer, confirmed that the data thieves gained entry to the company's computer system by stealing an outside vendor's credentials, and he disclosed for the first time that Target found malware on 25 registers three days after the company thought it had expunged it from its system.  Michael R. Kingston, chief information officer of the Neiman Marcus Group, spent much of his testimony going over the time frame that led to public disclosure of his company's breach on Jan. 10, some six months after it began last July. He said the malware that infiltrated the company's system was ''exceedingly sophisticated,'' that it had a ''zero percent detection rate'' by antivirus software, and that the company had first learned of a possible breach when MasterCard contacted it on Dec. 17 to say that 122 of its cards that had been used fraudulently had also been used at one Neiman Marcus store. The breaches have unsettled consumers, and left many angry and uncertain about the safety of their personal information. The cases have reignited calls for federal legislation setting database security standards and consumer notification requirements. (Currently federal law requires banks to notify customers of data breaches but retailers have no such requirement and are subject to a patchwork of state laws instead.) ''These stores are a major part of our economy,'' said the committee chairman, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. If consumers cannot trust businesses to keep their data secure, he said, ''our economic recovery is going to falter.'' The Target episode alone is believed to have exposed personal data of as many as 110 million customers, more than a third of the population of the United States. About 40 million of them were shoppers during much of the peak holiday season, from Nov. 27 through Dec. 18. (The phone numbers, email and mailing addresses may have been taken from as many as 70 million more customers, the company said last month.) The Neiman Marcus breach, though affecting far fewer people -- an estimated 1.1 million -- went on much longer, from July 16 to Oct. 30 of last year, the company said. In testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Kingston said no online transactions were affected. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, noted that she was a Neiman Marcus shopper -- including during the period when data was compromised -- but had not been personally notified by the company that her personal data may have been jeopardized. She said public disclosures through the media were ''too vague.'' Mr. Kingston insisted that all shoppers during that time had been notified directly, including online shoppers who weren't affected. ''Well, I'll go home and look for my notice,'' she replied. Reports of smaller breaches as well have emerged recently (including data skimming devices found on registers at a Nordstrom in Miami and the theft of data of about 6,000 online shoppers at Easton-Bell Sports). Recently Michaels Stores, the arts and craft retailer, disclosed that it was investigating a possible breach that could have exposed consumer data as well. Much of the discussion focused on a technology widely used in Europe called EMV that basically amounts to a small chip embedded in each card (rather than a magnetic stripe) that creates a new code for each transaction. This makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit cards, which often happens with stolen data, though the card data itself can still be taken and used for online purchases. The United States has been far slower to adopt the technology than the rest of the world in part because retailers have been reluctant to spend the money to replace current card-processing machines. But senator after senator, as well as witnesses ranging from a security expert at Symantec Corporation and the policy counsel at the Consumers Union, called on companies to institute the new technology -- and to require PINs with the use of chip cards. ''When this technology has been adopted in Europe, it has significantly decreased fraud,'' said Delara Derakhshani of the Consumers Union. ''We need a strong commitment for all stakeholders to adopt this technology sooner rather than later.'' The major credit card companies have already been stepping up the pressure, saying they will require all American retailers to install hardware that can read EMV chips by October 2015 or be liable for the costs of any fraud resulting from stolen data. On Tuesday, Mr. Mulligan said Target would beat that timetable by at least six months. He said the company was aiming to have devices in its stores that can read the cards with chips by the fourth quarter of this year and to issue its own branded RED cards in early 2015. ''We need to move together collectively so the whole system is employing chip and PIN technology,'' he said. Though members called for bipartisan cooperation in addressing the data security threat -- Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the panel's ranking Republican, said that ''this isn't a case where we've got business on one side and government on the other side'' -- there clearly were differing opinions on how far to go. Mr. Grassley said he wanted to avoid a government decree that all companies must do the same thing. Mr. Kingston of Neiman Marcus argued that once standards were made public, criminals would figure out how to get around them. With much focus on prevention, the session shed little light on the hackers behind the breaches. Investigators have said that they are an amorphous band of Russian-speaking cybercriminals who operate in various locations in Eastern Europe. The Secret Service and the Justice Department have been the lead investigators in the cases, and during Tuesday's hearing William Noonan, the deputy special agent in charge of the Secret Service's cyberoperations branch, talked about the increasing sophistication, collaboration and specialization among the individuals involved. He detailed division of labor where one person looks for access in a company system and others work on extracting information from the network. Then there are wholesalers and vendors, those who make the counterfeit cards and those ''on the street'' who buy goods with the fraudulent cards. He spoke of a marketplace where criminals buy and sell access to networks, as well as card data, bank and brokerage account information and hacking services. Some of the ''illicit digital marketplaces,'' he said, have websites with 80,000 users. ''These specialties raise both the complexity of investigating these cases, as well as the level of potential harm to companies and individuals,'' he said. "
"Obama Lets N.S.A. Exploit Some Internet Flaws, Officials Say","WASHINGTON -- Stepping into a heated debate within the nation's intelligence agencies, President Obama has decided that when the National Security Agency discovers major flaws in Internet security, it should -- in most circumstances -- reveal them to assure that they will be fixed, rather than keep mum so that the flaws can be used in espionage or cyberattacks, senior administration officials said Saturday. But Mr. Obama carved a broad exception for ''a clear national security or law enforcement need,'' the officials said, a loophole that is likely to allow the N.S.A. to continue to exploit security flaws both to crack encryption on the Internet and to design cyberweapons. The White House has never publicly detailed Mr. Obama's decision, which he made in January as he began a three-month review of recommendations by a presidential advisory committee on what to do in response to recent disclosures about the National Security Agency.  But elements of the decision became evident on Friday, when the White House denied that it had any prior knowledge of the Heartbleed bug, a newly known hole in Internet security that sent Americans scrambling last week to change their online passwords. The White House statement said that when such flaws are discovered, there is now a ''bias'' in the government to share that knowledge with computer and software manufacturers so a remedy can be created and distributed to industry and consumers. Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said the review of the recommendations was now complete, and it had resulted in a ''reinvigorated'' process to weigh the value of disclosure when a security flaw is discovered, against the value of keeping the discovery secret for later use by the intelligence community. ''This process is biased toward responsibly disclosing such vulnerabilities,'' she said. Until now, the White House has declined to say what action Mr. Obama had taken on this recommendation of the president's advisory committee, whose report is better known for its determination that the government get out of the business of collecting bulk telephone data about the calls made by every American. Mr. Obama announced last month that he would end the bulk collection, and leave the data in the hands of telecommunications companies, with a procedure for the government to obtain it with court orders when needed. But while the surveillance recommendations were noteworthy, inside the intelligence agencies other recommendations, concerning encryption and cyber operations, set off a roaring debate with echoes of the Cold War battles that dominated Washington a half-century ago. One recommendation urged the N.S.A. to get out of the business of weakening commercial encryption systems or trying to build in ''back doors'' that would make it far easier for the agency to crack the communications of America's adversaries. Tempting as it was to create easy ways to break codes -- the reason the N.S.A. was established by Harry S. Truman 62 years ago -- the committee concluded that the practice would undercut trust in American software and hardware products. In recent months, Silicon Valley companies have urged the United States to abandon such practices, while Germany and Brazil, among other nations, have said they were considering shunning American-made equipment and software. Their motives were hardly pure: Foreign companies see the N.S.A. disclosures as a way to bar American competitors. Another recommendation urged the government to make only the most limited, temporary use of what hackers call ''zero days,'' the coding flaws in software like Microsoft Windows that can give an attacker access to a computer -- and to any business, government agency or network connected to it. The flaws get their name from the fact that, when identified, the computer user has ''zero days'' to fix them before hackers can exploit the accidental vulnerability. The N.S.A. made use of four ''zero day'' vulnerabilities in its attack on Iran's nuclear enrichment sites. That operation, code-named ''Olympic Games,'' managed to damage roughly 1,000 Iranian centrifuges, and by some accounts helped drive the country to the negotiating table. Not surprisingly, officials at the N.S.A. and at its military partner, the United States Cyber Command, warned that giving up the capability to exploit undisclosed vulnerabilities would amount to ''unilateral disarmament'' -- a phrase taken from the battles over whether and how far to cut America's nuclear arsenal. ''We don't eliminate nuclear weapons until the Russians do,'' one senior intelligence official said recently. ''You are not going to see the Chinese give up on 'zero days' just because we do.'' Even a senior White House official who was sympathetic to broad reforms after the N.S.A. disclosures said last month, ''I can't imagine the president -- any president -- entirely giving up a technology that might enable him some day to take a covert action that could avoid a shooting war.'' At the center of that technology are the kinds of hidden gaps in the Internet -- almost always created by mistake or oversight -- that Heartbleed created. There is no evidence that the N.S.A. had any role in creating Heartbleed, or even that it made use of it. When the White House denied prior knowledge of Heartbleed on Friday afternoon, it appeared to be the first time that the N.S.A. had ever said whether a particular flaw in the Internet was -- or was not -- in the secret library it keeps at Fort Meade, Md., the headquarters of the agency and Cyber Command. But documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, make it clear that two years before Heartbleed became known, the N.S.A. was looking at ways to accomplish exactly what the flaw did by accident. A program code-named Bullrun, apparently named for the site of two Civil War battles just outside Washington, was part of a decade-long effort to crack or circumvent encryption on the web. The documents do not make clear how well it succeeded, but it may well have been more effective than exploiting Heartbleed would be at enabling access to secret data. The government has become one of the biggest developers and purchasers of information identifying ''zero days,'' officials acknowledge. Those flaws are big business -- Microsoft pays up to $150,000 to those who find them and bring them to the company to fix -- and other countries are gathering them so avidly that something of a modern-day arms race has broken out. Chief among the nations seeking them are China and Russia, though Iran and North Korea are in the market as well. ''Cyber as an offensive weapon will become bigger and bigger,'' said Michael DeCesare, who runs the McAfee computer security operations of Intel Corporation. ''I don't think any amount of policy alone will stop them'' from doing what they are doing, he said of the Russians, the Chinese and others. ''That's why effective command and control strategies are absolutely imperative on our side.'' The presidential advisory committee did not urge the N.S.A. to get out of the business entirely. But it said that the president should make sure the N.S.A. does not ''engineer vulnerabilities'' into commercial encryption systems. And it said that if the United States finds a ''zero day,'' it should patch it, not exploit it, with one exception: Senior officials could ''briefly authorize using a zero day for high priority intelligence protection.'' "
Getting a Clear Picture of a Computer Network's Security,"Security experts say the only hope of protecting corporate networks from hackers is something the industry calls ""defense in depth."" The phrase simply means that plugging in one traditional defense - antivirus software, or a firewall, is no longer going to cut it. To stay ahead of a determined and sophisticated adversary, a security officer's best hope is to layer on many different defenses - strong passwords, two-factor authentication, antivirus software, firewall protection, breach detection plans that can sift through vast amounts of employee data in search of anomalies - then pray they never make the headlines. But the dirty little secret of this growing online industrial complex is this: Even those who are layering on as many defenses as possible are still getting crushed. Why? Because their time is now spent maintaining software, chasing false positives and placating employees who suddenly find themselves locked out of the network, or unable to gain access to a file on the go.  ""It's a race you cannot win,"" said Hitesh Sheth, the chief executive officer of Vectra Networks, a start-up in San Jose, Calif., that is trying to help chief information security officers, or CISOs, deal with the deluge of data. ""CISOs are getting crushed."" Mr. Sheth left his post at Aruba Networks and Oliver Tavakoli, Vectra Network's chief technology officer, left his at Juniper Networks to start their company this year. With funding from Vinod Khosla's venture capital firm, Khosla Ventures; Accel Partners; AME Cloud Ventures and IA Ventures, which invests in data solutions, they created Vectra. Vectra does not claim to stop attackers from coming in. The goal is to quickly find out what's inside the network, with an advanced degree of precision, so that chief information security officers don't have to spend all their time chasing down false leads. Once they plug Vectra into their network, they can monitor suspicious network activity on a dashboard. On a recent Monday, one security officer used Vectra to get a full picture of a network. There were alerts to threatening activity, but Vectra also gave a sense of how threatening the activity could be. Up popped an alert when an employee installed Tor, software that enables online anonymity, which is sometimes used by cybercriminals to mask their whereabouts. Had the same user's device made another suspicious move - like scanning the network for an administrator's account and then trying to guess at her password by trying to log in multiple times - Vectra's tool would highlight the employee's computer and inform a security officer that the employee was a threat with a high degree of certainty. Had the odd behavior stopped at Tor, it would have also been flagged, but not been perceived as an immediate threat.  ""We have to make sure a security solution can provide us with enough credible intelligence to investigate thoroughly, so we're not bogged down with false positives and unnecessary work,"" said Sam Kamran, a chief information security officer at Riverbed Technology. ""Vectra helps us know the unknown."" ""The alerts we see have a higher level of confidence, and that allows us to concentrate our resources and chase down credible threats,"" Mr. Kamran added. Vectra's tool uses machine learning and data science to listen, think and anticipate an attacker's next move. It learns the typical traffic patterns and behaviors on a network, then remembers and correlates any abnormal behavior it has seen over days, weeks or months. That gives security officers the ability to drill down and see where, in an attack, a device's behavior may be. Based on any abnormal activity, Vectra's tool tells CISOs that that activity would indicate whether hackers are conducting reconnaissance, have broken into the network, or are, at worst, pulling data out of the network. An employee who inadvertently clicked on an ad and installed tracking software would be flagged as a low priority and remediation issue, whereas an infected device that was being used to pull data out of the network would pop up as a high-threat priority. Vectra started shipping only in March and has less than 100 customers. Beyond Riverbed, Mr. Sheth's former employer, Aruba, installed the tool to help it prioritize threats. Mr. Sheth said the tool had gained the most traction with financial services firms, technology firms and educational organizations. But he said he was also choosing to market the service beyond major companies to smaller ones that simply could not afford an army of analysts to dig into every possible threat.  Vectra devised the tool to be very basic. Customers work off a simple dashboard and can click on various threats and drill down if they need to, but the tool lacks any flashiness or extra features that might cause confusion. ""We wanted it to be as easy to set up as an iPhone,"" Mr. Sheth said. ""If a complex device like the iPhone can be made easier to use, why can't you extend that to a security product?""                       "
Hacker Tactic: Holding Data Hostage,"An investigative reporter for The New York Times. THE perpetual cat-and-mouse game between computer hackers and their targets is getting nastier. Cybercriminals are getting better at circumventing firewalls and antivirus programs. More of them are resorting to ransomware, which encrypts computer data and holds it hostage until a fee is paid. Some hackers plant virus-loaded ads on legitimate websites, enabling them to remotely wipe a hard drive clean or cause it to overheat. Meanwhile, companies are being routinely targeted by attacks sponsored by the governments of Iran and China. Even small start-ups are suffering from denial-of-service extortion attacks, in which hackers threaten to disable their websites unless money is paid. Just days after the F.B.I. and international law enforcement agencies teamed up earlier this month to kill one ransomware program, CryptoLocker, which had infected over 300,000 computers, another pernicious program, Cryptowall, popped up and began spreading rapidly.  In response, more companies are resorting to countermeasures like planting false information on their own servers to mislead data thieves, patrolling online forums to watch for stolen information and creating ''honey pot'' servers that gather information about intruders. Last year, companies also spent roughly $1.3 billion on insurance to help cover expenses associated with data theft. Some security experts are urging even more aggressive action. ''Companies want better results than are being delivered by law enforcement,'' said Stewart A. Baker, former assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security. He questioned whether the National Security Agency, the F.B.I. or the C.I.A. had enough qualified counterhackers to stake out corporate networks and also whether those businesses would be comfortable giving the government more access to their networks. Mr. Baker maintains that victims of data theft can reasonably argue that they have a right to follow and retrieve stolen data wherever the thief takes it. And, he added, federal law on the matter is so ambiguous that prosecuting a company for trespassing on the domain of a hacker would be difficult and highly unlikely. ''I do really believe there should be a Second Amendment right in cyber,'' added Jeffery L. Stutzman, vice president of Red Sky Alliance, referring to the right to bear arms. His company coordinates intelligence sharing for many of the world's top corporations. Virtually all of them are weighing how aggressive to be in combating hackers, he said. In 2011 Michael Hayden, former director of both the C.I.A. and the N.S.A., suggested that the government should consider allowing a ''digital Blackwater'' with paid mercenaries battling cyberattackers on behalf of corporations. But security experts warn that by taking matters into their own hands companies risk an escalating cycle of retaliation, lawsuits or Internet traffic jams. What's more, since cybercriminals typically hijack the systems of unwitting third parties to launch attacks, it is often hard to pinpoint targets for retaliation, said Orin S. Kerr, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. It is ''kind of like a blindfolded partygoer trying to hit a piñata with a baseball bat,'' he said. ''He might hit the piñata but he might hit Aunt Sally, who happens to be standing nearby.'' Companies might also trip up law enforcement efforts or find themselves on the wrong end of a lawsuit if they inadvertently gain access to someone else's server. And under many foreign laws, self-defense actions by private companies amount to espionage. The Justice Department takes the stance that a company is most likely breaking the law whenever it gains access to another computer network without permission. At a panel hosted by the American Bar Association, John Lynch, chief of the computer crime and intellectual property section of the Justice Department's criminal division, said that usually, when his office determines that companies have gone outside their server to investigate a perceived attacker, his first thought is, ''Oh wow -- now I have two crimes.'' There are, however, other ways to fight hackers that are both legal and effective, said Mr. Stutzman of Red Sky Alliance. His firm, for example, profiles attackers by keeping their pictures, phones numbers and other personal data on file. He is also an advocate of software that tags sensitive documents so that if they are stolen they self-destruct or transmit an alert to the owner. Most security companies say the main objective should be raising the cost to hackers. CloudFlare, for instance, has developed a service called Maze, which it describes as ''a virtual labyrinth of gibberish and gobbledygook'' designed to divert intruders to bogus data and away from useful information. Other companies create bottlenecks to route attackers through security checkpoints. It is fairly common for law firms to have their email read during negotiations for ventures in China, said Dmitri Alperovitch, a founder of CrowdStrike, a company that investigates hackers. So if a company knows its lawyers will be hacked, planting decoys can give them an upper hand, he said. This month CrowdStrike unmasked a secret cell of cyberthieves linked to the Chinese Army that had stolen millions of dollars' worth of data from military contractors and research companies, often by hiding its attack software in emailed invitations to golfing events. Samir Kapuria, vice president of Symantec's Cyber Security Group, recounted how his company helped a major manufacturer create bogus blueprints of a valuable product with a traceable but harmless flaw and left it hidden in its servers. When the manufacturer later found the planted blueprint for sale on the black market, he said, Symantec was able to help trace the leak to its source, fire the subcontractor and save the manufacturer tens of millions of dollars. But there can also be unintended consequences when planting false information, said Dave Dittrich, a security engineer at the University of Washington. He offered a theoretical example in which a company intentionally inserts flaws into a faked vehicle design. ''If someone plants false information to be stolen and used, and this results in the death of any innocent human beings,'' he said, ''there could be a good case made that the entity who planted the fake data is acting in a negligent and unjustifiable manner.'' In general, Mr. Kapuria of Symantec prefers a philosophical approach toward thwarting the legions of cybercriminals, describing the fight as ''Cyber Sun Tzu -- when the enemy is relaxed, make them toil; when full, make them starve; when settled, make them move.'' "
A Tax Inversion in All but Name,"Behold the unversion. United States-based data protection firm SafeNet may very well be able to slash its tax rate as part of a cross-border deal. Instead of doing so by acquiring an overseas company - a move known as an inversion - it isselling itself for $890 million to Dutch digital security outfit Gemalto. The deal shows the limitations of a possible Washington ban on inversions.  Corporations have been trying to leave the shores of the United States apace. Exploiting a portal in the tax code, they are buying smaller rivals in other countries as a way to change domicile and in some cases sharply reduce what they owe to Uncle Sam. The backlash, now joined by President Obama, has become strident. The decision by drugstore chain Walgreen to opt out of a potential inversion this week could be one notable consequence. Sales of  American companies to overseas buyers, though, are not in the cross-hairs. Yet SafeNet's deal could have a similar effect to an inversion. Presumably its tax home can shift from Baltimore to Amsterdam, where its new $8 billion parent company is located. Over half SafeNet's sales last year were generated outside the United States, Gemalto said on Friday, and would therefore be eligible for a reduced tax rate under a new domicile. SafeNet was taken private in 2007 by buyout firm Vector Capital so recent financial information is not public. According to a prospectus filed as part of a plan to float again a few years ago, SafeNet indicated it may have some buffers to curb its tax bill temporarily. In its last annual report as a public company, however, the company reported an effective income tax rate of 36 percent in 2003, 42 percent in 2004 and 50 percent in 2005. Last year, Gemalto's tax rate was 12 percent. As mergers go, the SafeNet deal is relatively plain vanilla. The buyer's shares even went up on the news, as often happens these days. For the anti-inversion crowd, though, it may signify something more important. A Washington crackdown won't necessarily stop United States companies from emigrating. In lieu of seeking a target with a cheaper tax domicile, they may just hang out for-sale signs to attract foreign suitors.  Jeffrey Goldfarb is U.S. editor at at Reuters Breakingviews.

N.S.A. Director Says Leaks Hamper Defense Efforts,"WASHINGTON -- Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency, said Tuesday that the leaks by the former agency contractor Edward J. Snowden had slowed the effort to protect the country against cyberattacks on Wall Street and other civilian targets. General Alexander was speaking at a conference at Georgetown University in one of his last public speeches before he leaves the agency this spring. He predicted that the disclosure of information relating to government surveillance programs would force Congress to act on changes to the rules governing the bulk collection of telephone records before it tries again to pass legislation that would mandate the way private companies protect against cyberintrusions, and delineate what information they share about attacks with the government.  The departing N.S.A. director and commander of the United States Cyber Command, which runs the cyberwarfare and defense operations for the Pentagon, described as largely incomplete what he called one of the agency's biggest tasks: finding a way to protect America's most vulnerable civilian targets. ''An attack on Wall Street or an exploit against Wall Street, N.S.A. and Cyber Command would probably not see that,'' General Alexander said. ''We have no capability there.'' Outside experts and the documents revealed so far by Mr. Snowden, who is still in exile in Moscow, suggest that the N.S.A. would, in fact, most likely see some attacks by monitoring the tens of thousands of ''implants'' it has placed in foreign computers suspected of being involved in cyberstrikes on the United States. But it is unclear what could be done to prevent them; there is no agreement inside the federal government yet about whether Cyber Command could launch a pre-emptive attack. Under a presidential directive updated by President Obama in 2011, only the president himself can authorize the use of an American cyberweapon, unless it is being used in an act of pure defense of national targets. ''We have capabilities to defend the nation,'' General Alexander said, ''but we don't have the ability to share that back and forth.'' Before the Snowden revelations, General Alexander often spoke of establishing large data filtering systems that could detect malicious attacks in real time. But that proposal went nowhere, and it would be almost impossible to convince critics, who have become increasingly concerned about the way the government carries out its surveillance programs, that the government was using those filters only to weed out attacks, rather than to listen to, read or manipulate incoming information. Several efforts to pass cybersecurity legislation requiring private companies to erect certain kinds of defenses have failed partly because of industry objections to the high costs of such systems and to the potential for government to delve into their private data. General Alexander argued Tuesday for something more modest: laws that would allow the companies to share data with the government about suspected incoming attacks. Currently that is prohibited in many cases by privacy laws. Any such legislation, however, would have to come after Congress considers changes in the way the government gains access to telephone records. Mr. Obama announced in January that he wanted to get the government out of the business of holding on to the vast databases of all calls made across American telephone networks, but it is not clear what alternative would be set up so that government officials could gain access to that data with the approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Changes to that program, often called the ''business records'' or ''215'' program because of its section number in existing legislation, would require congressional action. "
The Next Data Privacy Battle May Be Waged Inside Your Car,"Cars are becoming smarter than ever, with global positioning systems, Internet connections, data recorders and high-definition cameras. Drivers can barely make a left turn, put on their seatbelts or push 80 miles an hour without their actions somehow, somewhere being tracked or recorded. Automakers say they are only responding to consumer demand, and besides, they and regulators say, the new technologies help them better understand consumers and make the cars safer. But privacy advocates increasingly see something more unsettling for drivers: that someone is always watching. Now two senators are trying to give car owners more say over some of that data. Early next week, Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, and Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, will introduce a bill stipulating that car owners control the data collected on the device called the event data recorder. The recorder, commonly known as a black box, collects information like direction, speed and seatbelt use in a continuous loop. It is in nearly every car today, and in September, it is set to become mandatory. ''We've got real privacy concerns on the part of the public,'' Senator Hoeven said in a telephone interview. ''People are very concerned about their personal privacy, especially as technology continues to advance,'' he said, referring to revelations of spying by the National Security Agency. Fourteen states have already passed similar laws.  The data collected by the black box has already been the center of litigation by law enforcement agencies and insurance companies seeking to use the information against car owners. The bill would limit what the data could be used for and would require a warrant to release the data without the owner's consent. But even this legislation covers only part of what is a rapidly evolving technological landscape. At the International CES in Las Vegas this week, automakers and technology companies announced a stream of new products and services aimed at making cars more connected. Google announced it had a partnership with G.M., Audi, Honda and Hyundai to bring its Android platform to vehicle infotainment systems by the end of this year. At the same time, G.M. said it would start an app shop, where drivers can use apps like Priceline.com to book a hotel room and CitySeeker, which provides information about attractions and restaurants near the vehicle. The days of a driver being alerted to a deal at a retailer as he drives nearby are rapidly approaching. Many consumers, though, are unaware of just how much personal information is collected and used, privacy advocates say. ''Manufacturers do a poor job of informing consumers and explaining the privacy implications of new technology,'' said Khaliah Barnes of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a consumer group based in Washington. ''Often, that information is in the owner's manual, and when's the last time you thumbed through your owner's manual?'' It didn't help the automakers' reassurances about their handling of data when Jim Farley, Ford Motor Company's top sales executive, who is known for making off-the-cuff comments, told a panel at the CES: ''We know everyone who breaks the law. We know when you're doing it. We have GPS in your car, so we know what you're doing.'' Although he quickly added, ''By the way, we don't supply that data to anyone,'' and later issued a full retraction, the comments, even if overblown and meant to be provocative, fueled the concerns. Vehicle owners, Ms. Barnes said, should be able to request the information manufacturers record and delete information at their discretion. ''Consumers should decide what level of surveillance they want to be under,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''None of that should be on default. You should have to opt in.'' Automakers say that consumers are eager for the new products. At the CES, G.M. introduced a new camera in the 2015 Corvette Stingray designed to give track enthusiasts real-time feedback on their driving. The performance data recorder, as it is called, uses a camera mounted on the windshield and a global positioning receiver to record speed, gear selection and brake force. The Corvette's system goes further than traditional black boxes. A camera mounted on the windshield records the driver's point of view and a microphone in the cabin records any noises made in the car. Chevrolet said that the consumer owned the data, which is collected in a digital card housed in the glove compartment. But privacy lawyers say that the information can still be used against a driver, as well as G.M. and its suppliers, in litigation or by an insurance company investigating a driver's habits. ''The privacy and liability issues associated with the P.D.R. are as real as with any archived data that can be used by or against individuals,'' said William Kohler, a lawyer at Clark Hill in Detroit. The new brainpower in cars puts the industry in new territory with security and data privacy, said Thomas Kowalick, an expert in event data recorders and a former co-chairman of the federal committee that set the standard for black boxes. ''The major concern is not what an E.D.R. gathers now but that future in-vehicle technologies will make it possible to virtually record and track a vehicle's movement from point A to point B,'' Mr. Kowalick said. Garmin introduced a new windshield-suctioned camera that turns on automatically when the car starts. It records wide-angle footage as well as speed, location and time in the event of a collision, and also has a microphone that can record sound from within the car. ''We hope it takes some of the 'he said, she said' out of an incident in your car,'' said Ted Gartner, a spokesman. He said the device's owner also owned the data and that Garmin could not access it. ''There's no way that we have access to that data because there's no way to transfer the data out of the car wirelessly,'' Mr. Gartner said. Despite these and other assurances, the new products are attracting scrutiny in Washington. On Monday, the Government Accountability Office released a report stating that some automakers were keeping private data collected from onboard navigation systems and mapping apps for varying lengths of time and that car owners could not request that it be erased. The report, which was requested by Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, found that the 10 automakers, navigation device manufacturers and application developers surveyed did not make owners aware of all the risks of the data collection, like allowing third parties to track their location or gather sensitive information such as their religious and political activities and preferences. ''Information about your location is extremely sensitive,'' said Senator Franken, who is chairman of a Judiciary subcommittee on privacy and said he planned to introduce a bill that would legislate guidelines on when a vehicle owner's location could be shared. ''If someone has a record of your location, they can figure out where you live, where you work, the doctors you visit and where your kids go to school.'' "
Make Legal Memos Public,"To the Editor: You are right to argue that the Obama administration needs to do more to make public the critical legal opinions of the administration (''What Happened to Transparency?,'' editorial, Jan. 8).  As a general matter, lawyers need some privacy protection to provide candid and thoughtful advice to their clients. That privilege is well established. But lawyers working for the federal government also have an obligation to the public on whose behalf they serve. And lawyers in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel have the authority to issue opinions that have the force of law. For these reasons, previous heads of the Office of Legal Counsel have recommended that such opinions be made publicly available. But this administration, like the previous one, has been reluctant to follow this advice. On a range of matters, from warrantless wiretapping to drone strikes and the National Security Agency's Prism program, in which the emails and other online activity of foreigners are collected, the government is hiding legal justifications and creating secret law. If the courts are unwilling to correct this trend, Congress needs to amend the Freedom of Information Act to limit the scope of privilege for legal memos. In those instances where the Justice Department expects others to follow its advice, the analysis that supports its conclusions should be made public. MARC ROTENBERG JULIA HORWITZ Washington, Jan. 8, 2014 The writers are, respectively, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center and coordinator of the center's Open Government Project. "
French and German Leaders to Discuss Data Privacy,"LONDON -- Some European politicians want to keep Internet data closer to home. On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will meet with President François Hollande of France to discuss plans to create telecommunications networks that keep individuals' data inside European Union borders. The proposals could limit how companies like Google and Facebook share data between their operations in Europe and the United States. They also form part of a growing debate here over how consumers' online information should be used by technology companies and government agencies.  Many European policy makers, particularly in France and Germany, want to beef up data oversight in the wake of the revelations by the former National Security Agency analyst Edward J. Snowden about the surveillance activities of the United States and its allies in Europe. Yet analysts say any effort to keep European data solely within continental borders could prove difficult to put into effect because of how the Internet's infrastructure is designed. Internet traffic like emails routinely crosses national borders, and changes to data infrastructure like servers could take years to carry out and may cost billions of dollars. Much also will depend on new data and privacy rules that are currently being debated by European officials, and how large American tech companies respond to European fears that individuals' data has been misused. ''It's not possible to keep all European data inside the European Union,'' said Mark Little, a technology analyst at the research firm Ovum in London. ''It's a very political idea. European politicians are responding to concerns about citizens' data being held in the U.S.'' The meeting between the German and French leaders Wednesday comes after Ms. Merkel stated that European data should be secured within local borders to avoid being seen or collected by American companies and government agencies. ''We will, above all, discuss which European providers we have who offer security for our citizens,'' Ms. Merkel said in her weekly podcast on Saturday, without providing specifics about the proposals to be discussed with Mr. Hollande. ''So that you don't have to go across the Atlantic with emails and other things, but can build up communications networks also within Europe.'' In an effort to give people more control over how their personal information is used, Viviane Reding, the European Union's justice commissioner, has spent more than two years shepherding new data regulations and privacy laws through the European Union's labyrinthine bureaucracy. The proposals include giving Europeans the right to have their online information erased and providing individuals greater control over what data is collected and where it is kept. International companies with European customers would also have to comply with the strengthened controls or face fines totaling 2 percent to 5 percent of global revenues, or $138 million, whichever is greater. The rules, which are expected to become law next year, would allow companies to operate throughout the Continent if they fulfill the requirements outlined by an individual country's privacy regulator. Currently, companies must comply with regulators in each of the 28 countries of the European Union. ''Data protection has become a personal crusade for Reding,'' said Patrick Van Eecke, a Brussels-based data protection lawyer at DLA Piper, adding that European parliamentary elections in May could slow down the process. As European officials push forward with these new data rules, analysts say any efforts to create email and other online services for just the European market could prove unwieldy. The Internet's infrastructure, for example, relies on data moving across international borders. That structure would be difficult and costly to change, and could be almost impossible to police to meet European policy makers' demands. Many local tech companies also use so-called cloud computing services that run on servers located across the globe. Any changes would require large investments to expand Europe's own tech infrastructure. That may lead to higher prices for individuals as tech companies pass on the costs to customers. ''You can't create something out of thin air,'' said Sylvain Fabre, a research director at the technology consultancy Gartner in London. ''To build new network infrastructure from scratch is not going to be cost effective.'' Despite the difficulties, some European tech companies are forging ahead. The Norwegian email service Runbox, which does not rely on servers in the United States, says it has seen a 34 percent annual rise in customers to 14,000 by the middle of February in the wake of the N.S.A. scandal. The company and local competitors have marketed themselves as a safe alternative to American email services that have been caught up in the recent privacy scandals. Deutsche Telekom introduced an Internet service for German customers last year that encrypted email sent over its network. The company said it was responding to the N.S.A. privacy allegations, and now wants to expand the offering across Europe by partnering with other local telecom companies. In response, some American firms are also expanding their European operations to comply with the Continent's stricter stance, analysts say. That includes potentially expanding data centers in Europe that would allow users to access their information under local laws, instead of sending the data to the United States. ''If companies want to play in the European market, they will have to comply with European rules,'' said William Long, a data protection partner at the law firm Sidley Austin in London. ''It's too late to put the toothpaste back in the tube.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Scrutiny in California for Software in Schools,"A leading California lawmaker plans to introduce state legislation on Thursday that would shore up privacy and security protections for the personal information of students in elementary through high school, a move that could alter business practices across the nearly $8 billion education technology software industry. The bill would prohibit education-related websites, online services and mobile apps for kindergartners through 12th graders from compiling, using or sharing the personal information of those students in California for any reason other than what the school intended or for product maintenance.  The bill would also prohibit the operators of those services from using or disclosing the information of students in the state for commercial purposes like marketing. It would oblige the firms to encrypt students' data in transit and at rest, and it would require them to delete a student's record when it is no longer needed for the purpose the school intended. ''We don't want to limit the legitimate use of students' data by schools or teachers,'' Senator Darrell Steinberg, a Democrat who is the sponsor of the bill and the president pro tempore of the California Senate, said in a phone interview. ''We just think the public policy of California should be that the information you gather from students should be used for their educational benefit and for nothing else.'' Lawmakers like Mr. Steinberg are part of a growing cohort of children's advocates who say they believe that regulation has failed to keep pace with the rapid adoption of education software and services by schools across the country. A federal law, called the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, limits the disclosure of students' educational records by schools that receive federal funding. But some student advocates contend that an exception in the law, allowing the outsourcing of public school functions to private companies, may reveal personal information, hypothetically making children vulnerable to predatory practices. The prekindergarten to 12th grade education software market in the United States http://www.siia.net/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=4801&Itemid=318"">reached $7.97 billion in the 2011-12 school year, compared with $7.5 billion two years earlier, according to estimates from the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group. One reason for the growth is the enthusiasm of many educators for online services and apps that can analyze student performance in real time, offering the promise of personalized learning tailored to the individual child. But a recent study by researchers at Fordham Law School reported that American schools seemed ill-equipped to vet the data-handling practices of the services they used. Some schools, for instance, signed contracts that did not specify the kinds of student details that companies could collect or did not prohibit firms from selling students' personal information, the researchers reported. By aiming to regulate industry practices rather than school procedures, Mr. Steinberg's bill is intended to prevent businesses from exploiting information like students' names, ages, locations, family financial situations, medical information, or even their lunch preferences, said James P. Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a children's advocacy group based in San Francisco. California has been a national leader in data protection. It was the first state to enact a law requiring companies to report data breaches. And last fall, Mr. Steinberg, with the backing of Mr. Steyer's group, spearheaded the passage of the first ''eraser button'' law for children. It requires websites to allow users under 18 to delete their own posts. ''This isn't going to prevent ed tech companies from doing business. It's a very good market,'' Mr. Steyer said of the new student protection bill. ''But it is going to prevent companies from using software as a Trojan horse to gain access to student data for marketing purposes.'' The California effort comes at a time when federal and school officials have been talking up data-driven learning as a way to make education more engaging for students, improve their graduation rates and expand their career prospects. This month, President Obama announced industry pledges of more than $750 million to strengthen student access to high-speed Internet in their classrooms as well as to devices and software. Under the federal education privacy law, schools that receive federal funding must generally obtain written permission from parents before sharing their children's educational records. But an exception allows school districts to share those records -- which might include academic, disciplinary or disability information -- with services like online homework assignment systems, reading apps or school bus companies. The exception requires schools to maintain control over contractors' use of students' educational records. But some student privacy experts caution that federal rules may not be explicit enough to cover some of the latest technologies like those used by lunch account services that, for example, can scan the veins in a child's palm and use that unique biometric pattern to identify a student. Officials at the Education Department have said that the agency is developing best practices for schools to use in contracting out for web services and for transparency with parents. Many online school services already have privacy policies in which they pledge not to sell, rent or trade personal information to third parties. Take ZippSlip, a start-up that allows schools to electronically send permission slips to parents. The company collects and houses information for schools, like which students have peanut allergies or are on the soccer team. But neither the company nor its school district clients are using the information to, say, market soccer equipment to parents, said David Leslie, the chief executive of ZippSlip. ''ZippSlip creates a data-mining opportunity that has literally never been created before,'' like allowing schools to analyze parent-teacher communication patterns, Mr. Leslie said. But, he emphasized, ''we are not selling data to Walmart about who might be a better candidate to buy crayons.'' Still, Mr. Steyer of Common Sense Media is urging more formal protections for student data. ''We messed up the privacy of kids, and probably adults too, in the online commercial, consumer space because we weren't prepared for the extraordinary pace of technology,'' Mr. Steyer said. ''Now we have the opportunity to get it right in the school space.'' "
Documents Released on U.S. Wiretapping Since Sept. 11 Terrorist Attacks,"WASHINGTON -- Orders granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to allow the use of devices to secretly log the communications of suspected spies and terrorists underwent explosive growth after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but leveled off and began dropping around the middle of the last decade, newly disclosed documents show.  The documents are semiannual reports to Congress from the Justice Department showing how often it obtained orders from the surveillance court for ''pen registers and trap-and-trace'' devices. They keep track of metadata about incoming and outgoing phone calls and emails, showing who was involved in a conversation and when it took place, but not the contents of the communication. The reports had been classified and have never been made public. They were obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil liberties and technology advocacy group, via a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The reports show a steady escalation for several years after the terrorist attacks. There were only two such orders in the first half of 2001. By that time in 2002, there were 29, and the numbers kept climbing until they peaked at 184 in the second half of 2004. The numbers then bounced around below that level but gradually declined. They dropped to 58 in the second half of 2008 and have not been in the triple digits since. In the second half of 2012, the last period for which they were available, there were 69 such orders. As a measure of investigative activity by year, that pattern roughly corresponds with the total number of wiretap orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court each year, according to data also compiled by the Electronic Privacy and Information Center. Such orders surged from 932 in 2001 to a peak of 2,371 in 2007, but dropped off after that. It is not clear how the number of either pen register or wiretap orders relate to the National Security Agency's once-secret programs that collect bulk data about domestic communications and allow wiretapping without warrants if the target is a noncitizen abroad. The administration of George W. Bush began those programs outside of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act framework in 2001. But the court began authorizing the bulk email data program in 2004, the bulk phone call data program in 2006, and the wiretapping program in 2007. "
"At Google, Bid to Put Its Glasses to Work","SAN FRANCISCO -- At the 500 Club bar in the heart of the Mission district here, patrons are banned from wearing Google Glass. Two miles up the hill at the hospital at the University of California, San Francisco, a lung surgeon wears Glass to assist him as he operates. The contrast illustrates both the challenge and opportunity for Google as it plans to sell its Internet-connected headwear to the public later this year. Consumers have been wary of Glass. Yet it is finding more enthusiastic acceptance in the workplace: in medicine, law enforcement, manufacturing and athletics. ''I'm sure Google would love this to be a consumer technology, from a scale perspective, but I'm just not sure it is,'' said Chris Curran, chief technologist for the United States advisory practice of PwC, a business consulting firm.  ''It's a technology that's searching for problems to solve, and it's really a matter of where do the problems emerge?'' he added. So far, the most obvious place seems to be jobs that do not involve sitting at a desk, but where a screen with an Internet connection would come in handy. Eighty percent of workers have these jobs, according to Wearable Intelligence, which makes wearable technology software for them. Aiming at this market, Google is announcing on Tuesday a Glass for Work program to provide additional tools for business users, like tech support, and to explore how to sell Glass to more of them. It will not necessarily be an easy sell. The privacy concerns about Glass could be an even bigger issue in certain work settings, said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. Consider meetings in which sensitive information is exchanged, for example, with a doctor or financial adviser. Yet in many cases, he said, there are fewer privacy concerns about Glass in the workplace. ''I can think of a whole bunch of professions where Google Glass makes a lot of sense and poses almost no privacy risk at all and could be really valuable -- everything from engineering to car repair to architecture to lumberjacking,'' Mr. Rotenberg said. ''But what's interesting about all of those professions is that you're not actually interacting with a customer.'' Sullivan Solar Power, which installs solar panels in Southern California, is already using Glass; it created its own software to show technicians information like the electrical characteristics of a certain roof. ''Our construction guys and field techs, they're going up and down ladders, up on rooftops, around potentially dangerous equipment,'' said Michael Chagala, Sullivan's director of information technology. ''To be able to have their hands free is obviously critical, and they can't bring a laptop up a ladder or see one in the sun.'' Head-mounted devices have been around a long time in fields like the military, manufacturing and aviation. Glass is still just a prototype without features that workers say they need, like long battery life and protective lenses. And despite the initial interest, Glass remains a novelty at most businesses, in part because it is not yet publicly available, and for those invited to buy it, it costs $1,500. Sullivan Solar had to buy its first pair on eBay. Yet tech investors and entrepreneurs see potential. Start-ups that make Glass software for businesses are sprouting up, including Wearable Intelligence, Augmedix, CrowdOptic, APX Labs and Pristine. These companies have raised venture capital from investors including Emergence Capital Partners, DCM, Silicon Valley Bank and First Round Capital. Three other well-known Silicon Valley venture firms -- Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers -- also invest through Glass Collective, a partnership. Despite privacy concerns, health care has been particularly intriguing for Glass entrepreneurs. Six clinics, mostly in California, are using software from Augmedix. As the doctor and patient have a conversation, the software automatically enters the patient's information into an electronic chart. Because Glass includes video, the software understands even nonverbal communication; for example, if a patient points to the part of the body that hurts. The lung surgeon at U.C.S.F., Dr. Pierre Theodore, uses Glass when he performs minimally invasive surgery that requires the doctor to rely on imagery to guide the surgical instruments. By using Glass, Dr. Theodore can see the images from scans and the live images at the same time. ''There's relatively little shift of attention between seeing the patient in front of you and seeing critical information in your field of vision,'' he said. ''I believe it can be and will be revolutionary.'' Doctors at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston have been using Glass in the emergency room to see information like vital signs about a patient. One E.R. doctor, Dr. Steven Horng, said Glass told him that a patient with brain bleeding was allergic to several of the blood pressure medicines used to slow brain bleeding. Wearable Intelligence, which makes the software used by Beth Israel, adds safeguards to protect medical information. Doctors are unable to take pictures or operate Glass outside the hospital, and unlike the consumer version of Glass, no information from the medical version is stored on Google servers. Schlumberger, the multinational oil services company, also uses Glass software from Wearable Intelligence, to show checklists to technicians in the field in the United States and overseas. ''Their hands can be elbow-deep in grease and they can still navigate their checklist, hands-free,'' said Yan-David Erlich, founder and chief executive of Wearable Intelligence. Patrick Jackson, a firefighter in Rocky Mount, N.C., built a Glass app to show information from a 911 call, like a map and notes from the dispatcher, and to find the nearest hydrant. He plans to add information like floor plans and exits in buildings. ''I'm the driver of a ladder truck, so it's helpful to see that map really quickly and get a real quick glance of where we're going,'' Mr. Jackson said. Police officers from New York City to Byron, Ga., are also experimenting with Glass. Police departments could use it to collect evidence, stream video from a crime scene or settle accusations of police abuse, said Bill Switzer, a manager at Stalker Radar, which makes video technology called CopTrax for the police including software for Glass. Glass has shown up in professional athletics, too. Basketball players for the Sacramento Kings and Indiana Pacers have worn Glass with software from CrowdOptic to broadcast video streams to fans from their points of view, as well as during practice. It gives coaches a different view and a better understanding of court spacing and ball rotation, said Chris Granger, the Kings' chief operating officer. Google's new program for business users will eventually address some workplace issues, said Kelly Liang, director of business development for Google Glass, as well as improve Glass for consumers. Though many technologies, like smartphones, started in the workplace and later earned widespread adoption, companies like Google go after the consumer market because of its potential to create runaway hits. For Google, though, persuading consumers to put on Glass is going to be the hard part. Even some of the people who swear by Glass at work say they do not wear it outside the office. ''It's pretty geeky, you know?'' Dr. Theodore said. "
Students and Data Privacy,"TO THE EDITOR: The recent collapse of inBloom, the student data company, is a powerful reminder that in the era of Big Data, privacy still matters (''A Data Collector Drops Out,'' Technophoria, April 27). As we see it, the problem was not misunderstanding by the public, but a lack of meaningful privacy protections.  The Department of Education also bears some responsibility for inBloom's demise. Instead of defending important privacy laws that help protect student data, the department chose to loosen the rules so that private vendors could pull sensitive data out of local schools. Schools were also encouraged to collect far more information than they had in the past. Parents did not know what information was being collected, who would have access to it or what impact it might have on their children's future. Not surprisingly, many objected. The Education Department could help restore confidence in these data-intensive programs by strengthening privacy rules and establishing a Student Privacy Bill of Rights. Students should know what information about them is being collected and how it is being used. And schools should be more cautious about turning over their students data to others. MARC ROTENBERG AND KHALIAH BARNES Mr. Rotenberg is president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and Ms. Barnes is director of EPIC's Student Privacy Project. "
"One Ruling on Privacy, 28 Agencies","LONDON -- The ruling on Tuesday by Europe's highest court that Google can be forced to remove links from certain searches will be carried out by data privacy regulators at 28 different agencies across the European Union. But the court gave the agencies little guidance in applying the ruling, and they are likely to interpret it in different ways. That means people in different European countries could receive different treatment, which could lead to jurisdiction shopping.  ''The European Court of Justice is sending a strong message in this case,'' said Peter Hustinx, the European data protection supervisor. ''It's now up to the countries to provide consistency in how it's interpreted.'' At a conference in Berlin on Tuesday, regulators from three countries in the union -- the Netherlands, Ireland and Britain -- as well as officials from the union offered different views of how the law might be applied. The Dutch, for example, suggested they would look carefully at the court's language in interpreting the ruling, while others said they would decide more on a case-by-case basis. How regulators will interpret the ruling is just one of many questions that have left lawyers and technology experts in Europe scratching their heads over the decision. Another issue is whether non-Europeans could petition European regulators to have links to their personal histories removed. Yet another is what kind of obligation Google or other search engines might have in responding to requests to remove links. In their ruling, the panel of 13 judges at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg not only gave no guidance on how their ruling was to be carried out, they also gave no indication that they recognized the Pandora's box their ruling might open. The decision focused narrowly on the legal ruling that Google, as a ''controller'' of information, is bound by European privacy law to heed private citizens' requests to remove links, when requested, absent a compelling public interest in leaving them up. ''The judges aren't digitally savvy,'' said Patrick van Eecke, a data protection lawyer at DLA Piper in Brussels who has argued cases before the court and echoed the views of other lawyers who have argued technology cases there. ''It will be very difficult to put this legal ruling into practice.'' A spokesman for Google, which holds an 85 percent share of the digital search market in Europe, declined to comment or speculate on how the company's European operations would be affected. But legal experts and analysts said Google and others will probably have to create new procedures, involving new administrative offices, to process individual petitions for removing links. ''It may be very disruptive for search engines going forward,'' said Luca Schiavoni, a technology analyst at the research company Ovum in London. Google and other digital companies covered by the decision could try to restrict efforts to erase online content to just Europe, legal experts said, but it might be more practical -- and cheaper -- to simply remove links across all their worldwide platforms. However they respond, the companies could find themselves wrestling with a quagmire of international legal issues. European consumers, for example, would be covered by European laws, in which free speech and privacy typically have a fairly equal standing. Under proposed stronger data-protection standards, any global company, even if it had no physical presence in Europe, would have to follow those rules if its services were used by European consumers. But Americans seeking to play the European privacy card might find themselves restrained by the free-speech laws of the United States. The European court got involved in the case when Spain's data regulator sought its guidance after Google refused to remove links to a Spanish lawyer's tax and debt information. But Google has already faced a number of requests across Europe to take information down, for a variety of legal reasons. In Germany, for instance, Google already blocks links to content that promotes fascist principles. And in Italy, a local charity sued Google after a video showing a child with Down syndrome being bullied by other children was uploaded to YouTube, the company's video service. The charity contended that the video violated the child's privacy. Google removed the online content. Three of its executives, convicted of invasion of privacy by a lower court, were acquitted last year by the country's supreme court. But never before has Google, or any other Internet search provider, faced the prospect of handling so many demands for unlinking online content that the new European ruling may have unleashed. ''This move looks difficult to enforce on a large scale,'' said Mr. Schiavoni, the Ovum analyst. "
"Some Privacy, Please? Facebook, Under Pressure, Gets the Message","SAN FRANCISCO -- Do you know who can see what you are posting on Facebook, including your photos, birthday and personal cellphone number? Chances are that you don't. Facebook is worried that you will start sharing less -- or maybe even move to more anonymous services -- unless it helps you better manage your private information. On Thursday, the company announced that it would give a privacy checkup to every one of its 1.28 billion users worldwide, conducted by a cartoon dinosaur. Facebook, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif., will also change how it treats new users by initially setting their posts to be seen only by friends. Previously, those posts were accessible to anyone. And it will explain to both current and new users that setting their privacy to ''public'' means that anyone can see their photos and posts.  The change in default settings and the person-by-person review is a sharp reversal for Facebook, whose privacy settings are famously complicated. Some users may be shocked when they see just how widely their personal information has been shared. For most of its 10-year history, Facebook has pushed and sometimes forced its users to share more information more publicly, drawing fire from customers, regulators and privacy advocates across the globe. That helped make Facebook the world's largest social network and an advertising behemoth. But the company recently concluded that its growth depended on customers feeling more confident that they were sharing intimate details of their lives with only the right people. ''What we really want is to enable people to share what they want,'' Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder and chief executive, said in a recent interview. And more sharing means more growth and more opportunities to place ads for Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg has also watched the rapid growth of privacy-friendly services like WhatsApp and Snapchat and anonymous sharing apps like Secret and Whisper, which compete for the time of many Facebook users, especially the younger ones. That prompted him to strike a deal this year to buy WhatsApp for as much as $19 billion and take steps to make the Facebook social network more respectful of user privacy. ''Private communication has always been an important part of the picture, and I think it's increasingly important,'' he said. ''Anything we can do that makes people feel more comfortable is really good.'' Nearly nine in 10 Internet users have taken steps online to remove or mask their digital footprints, according to a telephone survey of 1,002 American adults last July by the Pew Research Center. Facebook is also feeling enormous pressure from privacy regulators around the world, said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group. ''If they don't make these changes, they're going to be sanctioned,'' he said. The Federal Trade Commission found in 2011 that Facebook misled users about how widely their data was shared and the company agreed to stricter commission oversight for 20 years. In Europe, privacy officials are reviewing the company's proposed acquisition of WhatsApp, which offers users much stricter privacy protection than Facebook does. ''They have gotten enough privacy black eyes at this point that I tend to believe that they realized they have to take care of consumers a lot better,'' said Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit research and advocacy group. Even as Facebook takes steps to empower its users on privacy, it continues to introduce features that raise new issues. On Wednesday, it announced an optional service for mobile phones that eavesdrops on the sounds in a room to try to identify any music or television shows that might be playing so that a user can share that information with friends. However, Facebook has made several other moves recently that indicate that it is taking privacy more seriously. Last month, it began a location-sharing feature called Nearby Friends that is optional and provides only a user's general location. And it made changes to Facebook Login, a service that allows people to use their Facebook identities to log in to other sites and apps, that reduce the amount of information shared outside Facebook, and in some cases shares nothing at all. In its announcement, Facebook said that when people signed in to post something on the company's popular social network, they would soon see a blue cartoon dinosaur that popped up with the message, ''We just wanted to make sure you're sharing with the right people.'' The service will then walk users through the privacy settings for their status updates, remind them of the applications that have permission to use their Facebook data, and review the privacy settings for some of the most private information on their profiles, like their hometown, employer, phone number and birth date. ''People sometimes feel that their information is more public than they want,'' Mike Nowak, a Facebook product manager who worked on the privacy checkup, said in an interview. ''It's not fun when you share something and someone you didn't expect to be able to see it can see it.'' Privacy advocates have long complained that Facebook's privacy controls, which allow people to set separate permissions for nearly every single item they put on the service, are too complicated. And for years, Facebook has continued to push the envelope on privacy, despite those concerns. For example, when it first allowed its users to share posts publicly in 2009, it decided that the default setting for all posts by new users would be public, which meant that anyone could see them. Ms. Dixon said that particular setting was a sore point for her, since new users were the ones least likely to understand the implications of posting publicly. Given Facebook's history, some people are wary about its latest moves. ''This is Potemkin privacy protection, a facade intended to assure regulators that Facebook is doing something to address widespread user concerns,'' Mr. Rotenberg said. Facebook has been testing portions of the privacy checkup for months and has not yet decided how extensive it will be. The company is also trying to determine how it will work for the 341 million users who gain access to the service only through mobile devices. Facebook is also considering broader privacy changes, like creating a dashboard that would make it easier to find and update a range of privacy settings. ''Privacy is not an all-or-nothing issue for users,'' said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Research Center Internet and American Life Project. ''They want to be able to adjust the dials.'' "
E.U. Debates Which Nation Will Regulate Web Privacy,"LONDON -- The new European Parliament that was voted into office over the weekend, despite having a different political makeup, is widely expected to reach a final agreement this year on stricter online privacy rules that have long been in the works. The rules, which have been discussed since 2012, would be stricter than those in the United States. They would create one law across the European Union to protect several aspects of online privacy, which is enshrined as a fundamental right in Europe, including restrictions on what information could be shipped overseas. And they would impose multimillion-dollar fines on any company that misuses Europeans' data.  Still, a crucial question remains: Which European regulator will have the final say in enforcing the rules? Under the proposals, companies will be able to operate throughout the region if they fulfill the requirements -- and the interpretation -- of European rules from only one country's privacy authority. Companies currently must comply with the regulator in each of the 28 countries in the union in which they operate. Lawmakers in favor of the proposals say that leaving the oversight with one country's office gives companies more clarity about the rules. But consumer groups in Europe have warned that if the current proposal stands, technology companies -- including American giants like Microsoft, Amazon and Google -- could set up shop in the European country with the most lenient interpretation of data privacy. ''This issue has become more political than technical,'' said Raegan MacDonald, European policy manager for the digital rights group Access in Brussels. ''Who gets to decide on these matters is very important.'' The legislation is expected to be completed in the first half of next year. It has gained momentum since the revelations from Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about the spying activities of American and British intelligence agencies. Before the rules go into effect, though, each country in the union must reach a final agreement with the European Commission, the union's executive arm, and the European Parliament. The proposals build on existing rules from the 1990s, providing citizens with greater control over what data is collected, where it is kept, and which companies and governments have access to it. The rules also restrict what information can be sent to countries that do not replicate Europe's data protection laws. To police the new rules, international companies with European customers -- even if they do not have offices in the region -- would have to comply with the controls or face fines totaling 2 to 5 percent of their global revenue, or $137 million, whichever is greater. ''The reforms in Europe will affect companies' global operations,'' said Wim Nauwelaerts, a data protection partner at the law firm Hunton & Williams in Brussels. ''The fines are Europe's big stick to ensure people take this seriously.'' Faced with the prospect of tougher privacy rules, companies like Facebook and eBay have lobbied hard since the proposals were first outlined to limit the legislation's impact, saying that Europe was creating strict laws that make it difficult for companies to invest in the region's lackluster economy. Industry groups have raised fears that the new laws would add extra costs, because companies must explicitly tell consumers on a regular basis how their data is used, and limit what information is sent to countries that do not comply with Europe's privacy rules. Yet companies have supported giving one regulator sole control over interpreting European rules. That, they say, adds regulatory certainty because companies will be responsible to just one authority across the region. ''We're concerned that the new rules will remain as fragmented as they are today, but it will cost more to comply,'' said John Higgins, director general of Digital Europe, a trade body in Brussels whose members include Microsoft and Apple. Some national governments, however, have balked at these changes. Countries like Germany believe their domestic privacy rules, which are some of the most stringent in the world, may be watered down if other regulators gain greater control. European lawmakers also have criticized the rules because citizens may not have the money, or even the language skills, to bring complaints against companies in other European countries. Already, questions about who monitors and regulates online privacy are bubbling to the surface. Two weeks ago, the union's highest court ruled that people could demand that Google take down links to information about them on the Internet. This so-called right to be forgotten, which is an important part of Europe's new data protection legislation, allows individuals -- European Union citizens and others -- to force global tech companies to remove links to their past activities, as long as people are not deemed to be public figures like celebrities or politicians. Analysts say the legal decision will force Google and other search companies to field a wave of requests that online links be taken down. But the ruling must be carried out by data privacy regulators at 28 different agencies across the union, which could lead to jurisdiction-shopping. ''Data protection can't survive on a national level,'' said Peter Schaar, a former federal data protection commissioner in Germany. ''We need to have an international approach.'' If the final privacy decisions will eventually rest with an individual regulator, many consumer groups expect Ireland to become the de facto arbiter on privacy matters for the union. Many American technology companies are based in Ireland because of low tax rates, and digital rights advocates say that Ireland is already known for taking a more moderate view on online privacy issues than are regulators in places like Germany and France. Others have called on individual countries' regulators to continue to play a role by acting as intermediaries between individuals and the privacy authority that holds the main responsibility for policing each company. That, industry lobbyists say, may lead to national regulators' continuing to vie for control over privacy matters, despite regulatory efforts to make it easier to deal with individual complaints. Whatever the outcome, European politicians say their policies will have more bite than the current rules -- as well as those on the books in the United States. ''Lobbyists need to understand that we're creating a global digital standard,'' said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German politician and a leading supporter of the new privacy rules. ''This is important for all of our citizens.'' "
Facebook to Let Users Alter Their Ad Profiles,"SAN FRANCISCO -- If you have ever wondered why Facebook showed you that advertisement for a new iPhone game or a cheap flight to Bermuda, you will soon be able to find out. Facebook announced on Thursday that it is going to give its users the ability to see the dossiers of likes and interests it keeps on them, as well as the ability to change, add or delete information in those files. And if you don't like an ad, you will be able to tell the social network what types of marketing messages you would rather see. But even as the social network gives its users more insight into the data it collects on them, it said it would also begin adding even more details to their profiles gleaned from watching what they do on other websites and from their smartphone apps. Users can opt out of such extended tracking, but they will have to visit a special ad industry website and adjust their smartphone settings to do so.  The additional tracking immediately raised the hackles of privacy advocates, who warned that the end result will be a Facebook that knows more about its users than ever before and uses that information to sell products to them. ''The privacy announcements today are a political smokescreen to enable Facebook to engage in more data gathering,'' said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group that promotes privacy rights. ''They claim to protect user privacy at the same time as they work to undermine it.'' Detailed tracking of people's digital activities has become commonplace. Other big companies like Google and Yahoo, as well as data brokers and small players that most people have never heard of, scoop up data on people's online, and even offline, activities to develop detailed profiles that are used to market products. Consumers are largely unaware of the monitoring and often don't know how to limit it. Both the Federal Trade Commission and the White House recently called on Congress to pass legislation that would better protect such private data, including requiring companies to give people more control over the digital files collected on them. The F.T.C., which was briefed on the company's plans, declined to comment. For Facebook, giving users a bit more control over their data even while collecting more information about them could be smart business. Companies are likely to buy more ads and pay higher prices if they know that their pitches are reaching a receptive audience, and the audience is more likely to be receptive if the ad is relevant to them. ''The thing that we have heard from people is that they want more targeted advertising,'' said Brian Boland, Facebook's vice president in charge of ads product marketing. ''The goal is to make it clear to people why they saw the ad.'' Right now, the company's marketing profiles are based mostly on people's activities on Facebook, such as liking brand pages or sharing a funny ad. That record of user interests is the basis of ad targeting on the social network. For example, an auto advertiser like Toyota might pay to, say, reach 30-something men in the United States who like Ford and S.U.V.s. Facebook is now simultaneously inviting users to improve the accuracy of its existing list of their interests while it adds to that list from other sources. ''At the end of the day, it's all about data,'' said Debra Aho Williamson, who studies social media for the research firm eMarketer. ''Marketers want more data to be able to target people. And Facebook wants more data to make the advertising as relevant as possible.'' Facebook began informing its American users about the changes on Thursday, and they will receive access to their profiles within the next few weeks. The company said it would introduce similar access to other users around the world in coming months. Although Facebook will now give its users a way to modify the customer profiles that drive the ads they see, users cannot completely get rid of ads. If people were to delete everything Facebook had collected about them, they would simply see more generic pitches based on other information that they have given Facebook, like their location, gender and age. Most other big Internet companies already allow consumers to see, change or block some of the personal attributes that they use to deliver ads. Last year, the data broker Acxiom also began allowing people to see at least a portion of the profiles it had collected on them. But Facebook will be the first major Internet company to show consumers how a specific ad for, say, a new television, is linked to a particular assessment of their interests, such as a fondness for electronics. Every ad will have a tiny arrow in the right corner. If you click on that, then choose ''Why am I seeing this?'' Facebook will tell you the most important attribute about you that led it to show the ad. You will also be able to click through to your full marketing dossier, or what Facebook calls your ad preferences, and see all of the attributes that Facebook believes describe you. Typically, those attributes will be a mix of general interests, like coffee or house music, and more specific ones, such as the coffee brand Illy and the rapper Kesha. Users can change, delete or add to the information in their files. Facebook already offers a way to block ads from a particular advertiser, by clicking on the arrow on the top right of an ad and choosing the option to hide all ads from that brand. Facebook executives hope that people will choose to improve the accuracy of the information, although people concerned about their privacy could just as easily fill their profiles with fake information. Joseph Turow, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication, said that Facebook's users would be tempted to share even more about themselves with the company. ''Who in his right mind wouldn't want relevant ads over irrelevant ads?'' he said. And that will make Facebook, already one of the fastest-growing advertising companies on the Internet, more powerful than ever. ''It's more likely to help Facebook than you,'' Mr. Turow said. "
"Irked by N.S.A., Germany Cancels Deal With Verizon","LONDON -- Germany said on Thursday that it would cancel a contract with Verizon Communications, part of the fallout from continuing revelations by Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, who says that American intelligence agencies had routine access to global data provided by telecom companies.  Mr. Snowden's accusations have had particular impact in Germany, where the personal cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly was tapped by United States intelligence agencies. Telecom providers in the United States like Verizon and Internet giants like Google have been fighting to show that they did not actively participate in the clandestine activities. But as anger on the Continent has grown, the region's own cellphone carriers, like Deutsche Telekom, have been promoting their European roots -- and the fact that they comply with Europe's stringent data protection rules -- to win business from American competitors. The cancellation of Verizon's contract with the German government is one of the first signs that companies in the United States are starting to lose business because of the scandal. Verizon provided telecom services to many of Germany's federal agencies. ''The links revealed between foreign intelligence agencies and firms after the N.S.A. affair show that the German government needs a high level of security for its essential networks,'' the German Interior Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The ministry added that it would reorganize its communication infrastructure to strengthen security as the contract with Verizon was phased out. In response, Verizon said that its German operations complied with the country's data protection rules. ''We have made it clear that the U.S. government cannot access customer information that is stored outside the United States,'' Detlef Eppig, managing director of Verizon Germany, said in a statement on Thursday. As Europeans fret that the United States government is continuing to check their online data, Internet privacy has taken center stage. Last month, Europe's highest court ruled that Google must provide local users the right, under certain circumstances, to request that information about themselves be removed from online searches. And on Wednesday, the United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., said that new legislation was planned to grant Europeans the same privacy rights as American citizens when data is sent to America for law enforcement purposes. European policy makers welcomed the announcement, but called on the United States to pass new laws that would allow Europeans to sue in American courts if their online data was misused. ''Words only matter if put into law,'' Viviane Reding, the European justice commissioner, said in a statement. ''We are waiting for the legislative step.'' "
Superpowers of the Web,"Readers respond to a July 16 letter from Marc Rotenberg, an Internet privacy expert, calling on policy makers to examine the business practices of dominant Internet companies like Facebook and Google. To the Editor: Your recent article about the reluctance of consumers to turn away from the Internet titans suggests that most users are largely satisfied with the current choices (''Principles Are No Match for Europe's Love of U.S. Web Titans,'' Business Day, July 7). A better reading could be that they have no real choices. A small group of companies today controls much of the online world. Internet companies have grown in part because of the same network effects -- the benefits that arise with many participants in the same communications environment -- that enabled the growth of the Internet. Large Internet companies have also benefited from powerful economic incentives, a lax regulatory environment, rapid technological changes and business practices that are designed to deprive users of meaningful choices. The practical consequence is increasing consolidation of Internet-based services and little real choice for consumers.  Consider Facebook's recent acquisition of WhatsApp, the popular messaging service, or Google's purchase of Nest, the smart home thermostat company. Both of the target companies had offered strong privacy safeguards to consumers. Now they -- and the data of their users -- will simply be subsumed in the larger companies. Companies are also doing more through the political realm to extend their power. Witness Google's proxy war against the recent privacy decision of the top court in Europe, waged through media organizations that are themselves losing readers and revenue to Google. Or consider Facebook's decision to remove Facebook groups critical of the company. Much is said about the use of these platforms to promote democracy and human rights in the Middle East, China and Russia. But hardly a word is spoken when these companies prevent their own users from expressing criticism. Political institutions today are not well equipped to deal with the realities of the modern Internet economy. Change is happening quickly. The benefits are oftentimes dazzling, and to many policy leaders disorienting. But there is a real need for a more thoughtful, critical examination of current business practices. MARC ROTENBERG Washington, July 11, 2014 The writer is president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center and has been active in Internet governance issues for more than 20 years. Readers React There is no one more committed or passionate about online issues than Marc Rotenberg, but I don't share his pessimism about the future of the Internet. The barriers to entry for new and better online companies are low, and consumers are fickle. By the millions, consumers vote online for their preferred company with the click of a mouse. The so-called behemoths now are competing on privacy. In a few short years, we have seen literally millions of new apps offering new services to consumers -- many privacy-enhancing. And most exciting is the emergence of new tools that promise great features and more user control, at start-ups and behemoths alike. Watchdogs like Mr. Rotenberg are keeping the pressure on, and that's a good thing. They should take heart that there is a hopeful future for privacy and the Internet. CHRISTOPHER WOLF Washington, July 16, 2014 The writer is the founder and co-chairman of the Future of Privacy Forum and a lawyer focusing on privacy issues. One reason companies such as Google may not be facing as much political resistance here as they are in Europe is that they have gotten heavily engaged in the political process, on both the state and federal levels, and on both sides of the aisle. Since 2012 Google has spent an average of $1.4 million per month on federal lobbying -- ranking third in lobbying spending among all companies, according to OpenSecrets. Ironically, the company that is making the world's information more accessible is secretive about its own political practices. Google should join tech peers such as Microsoft in disclosing more about its lobbying campaigns and its funding of politically active nonprofits, as some shareholders urged at the company's annual meeting. SAM JEWLER Washington, July 17, 2014 The writer is communications officer at U.S. Chamber Watch, a project of Public Citizen. Consumers have repeatedly patronized companies knocked for controversial business practices. Post a comment to your Facebook ''wall'' about Wal-Mart, Starbucks, Foxconn, Microsoft, Monsanto or any other newsmaker to glimpse these criticisms. For the sake of low prices and convenience, we've condoned business practices that go against our principles and harm others and, occasionally, ourselves. And now, for the sake of low prices, free services and convenience provided by Internet titans, we're doing the same thing. Is it time yet to reassess our priorities? JONATHAN CAREY San Francisco, July 16, 2014 Mr. Rotenberg's assessment that our political institutions are not well equipped to deal with Internet realities is correct. We are at a key regulatory moment. Now is the moment to educate our policy makers. We have a chance for a far-seeing policy that puts long-term public need ahead of short-term private profit. To aim only for the bottom line is to aim too low. WILLIAM F. BAKER New York, July 16, 2014 The writer is director of the Bernard L. Schwartz Center for Media, Public Policy and Education at Fordham University and president emeritus of WNET public television. Mr. Rotenberg's letter delivers a welcome breath of clarity and fresh air, but it does not go far enough. The ''behemoths'' that we have to cope with in the United States include the broadband oligopoly of Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. The most dangerous scenario is one in which the web giants, such as Google, Facebook and Netflix, collude with the big broadband operators in order to strike deals for the delivery of their services over these operators' networks that are beneficial to them (as Netflix has already done), while unreasonably discriminating against smaller Internet companies with no or little negotiating power, and further increasing consumers' costs. In other words, today's winners will pull up the ladder to inhibit the next wave of innovative entrepreneurs. MARTYN ROETTER Boston, July 16, 2014 The writer is a telecommunications consultant. Facebook recently experimented with its users by modifying their news feeds, and concluded that manipulation of the news feed modified the mood of the user. Facebook seems to consider that it has ownership of its users' data and no obligations that aren't voluntary. The Internet itself should be regulated as a public utility. We need a national conversation on the rights of users and how to promote competition rather than looking away as the big companies eat up all the potential innovators that might provide competition. Since so many of the privacy problems are driven by the need for advertising revenue, it would be nice to have more for-pay players, with no ads. BRIGITTE DE SAINT PHALLE Albuquerque, July 16, 2014 Mr. Rotenberg's observation that network effects allow large Internet companies like Google, Facebook and Netflix to dominate their markets has implications far beyond the privacy issues he cites. The ''net neutrality'' debate raging in the United States proceeds from the assumption that Internet providers -- cable, fiber, wireless and modern D.S.L. -- are monopolies that can bully hapless content-providing companies. But these companies have far greater market power. Google controls 88 percent of the market for search, and Facebook and YouTube together control more than 80 percent of all social media, for example. From Facebook to Kickstarter, these services are so powerful and popular that no I.S.P. could market a network without unimpeded access to them all. A provider that discriminated against Netflix or Ebay in favor of its own offerings would lose customers by the droves. Google started in a garage, but now has a market value about seven times that of General Motors. The power of the Internet companies that Mr. Rotenberg identifies makes clear they don't need regulatory help. EV EHRLICH Bethesda, Md., July 17, 2014 The writer is president of ESC Company, an economics consulting firm, and former under secretary of commerce in the Clinton administration. The Writer Responds I once would have agreed with Mr. Wolf's view, but the evidence increasingly points in a different direction. Instead of innovators displacing incumbents, today incumbents are acquiring innovators. Federal agencies that once pursued major cases to protect consumer privacy have since dropped the ball on enforcement. Little has been done to stop the downward spiral of privacy policies and the increasing profiling of Internet users. Mr. Jewler points to a deeper problem that should trouble many -- the institutions of government and the media itself are being transformed by the companies that should be the focus of public scrutiny. The United States has a long history of reining in the excesses of private power, but that requires effective government and an independent media. Both are increasingly within the gravitational pull of the large Internet companies. Of course, I agree with Mr. Baker about the need for long-term policies that promote growth and innovation, while safeguarding privacy and consumer rights. That is the direction we need to head. But the clock is ticking. Consolidation is accelerating. The titans are already taking steps to block competition in markets that do not yet exist. Google is trying to buy many of the new Internet top-level domains -- ''.books,'' ''.movies,'' ''.family,'' ''.love'' and ''.earth.'' Facebook, as Ms. de Saint Phalle noted, is now manipulating the news users see to make them happy and sad. My letter only scratched the surface of the growing threats to the open Internet. MARC ROTENBERG Washington, July 18, 2014 "
Judge Rules for Seizure of Emails Kept Abroad,"Updated, 8:38 p.m. | Microsoft has suffered a setback in its efforts to block federal prosecutors from seizing a customer's data that is stored overseas.  Judge Loretta A. Preska of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on Thursday upheld a magistrate judge's ruling that Microsoft must turn over the customer's emails, held in a Microsoft data center in Ireland. Big technology companies have rallied around Microsoft in the case, seeing the ruling as a potential threat to their plans to offer cloud computing services overseas. Microsoft plans to appeal the ruling. Judge Preska agreed to stay her order while the company pursues the appeal. The issue at the heart of the case is whether communications kept in overseas data centers operated by American companies are beyond the reach of domestic search warrants. Microsoft has argued that federal prosecutors cannot seize the data in Ireland because United States law does not apply there, even though Microsoft controls everything in its data center there. ''What is at stake is the privacy protection of individuals' email and the ability of American tech companies to sustain trust around the world,'' Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in an interview after the ruling. The Microsoft case is believed to be the first time that an American company has fought against a domestic search warrant for data stored overseas. Craig A. Newman, a lawyer with Richards Kibbe & Orbe who was present in the courtroom in New York on Thursday but is not involved in the case, said the decision could lead to a clash between European and United States privacy laws. ''This type of ruling is going to open up a Pandora's box of concerns by European countries,'' Mr. Newman said. Individuals and corporate users of technology increasingly rely on services that store email, documents and other private data in the cloud. Technology companies like Microsoft are building data centers around the world to meet that demand. But customers in some countries are concerned that the ruling in this case could mean that their private data would be accessible to American law enforcement. Mr. Smith, in an earlier interview, said he was quizzed about the case in the spring by technology officials from German government agencies and was told that they would not use data centers operated by American companies if the search warrant was allowed to proceed. Apple, AT&T and Verizon have all filed briefs in support of Microsoft's opposition to the search warrant.In a statement, Wayne Watts, general counsel of AT&T, said the company was ''extremely disappointed'' with the ruling. ''There is nothing more critical than protecting the privacy and information of every single AT&T customer -- no matter the country in which they reside,'' he said in the statement. The search warrant in the case was granted by a federal magistrate judge in New York late last year. The identity and the nationality of the customer whose emails are being sought have not been disclosed, though the warrant in the case suggests that it is related to drugs. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Irish Panel to Pick Privacy Regulator With Global Reach,"In the coming weeks, an Irish government committee is set to pick the country's new data privacy regulator, a relatively obscure position but one with global sway. The five-person panel of civil servants and privacy experts will choose a data protection commissioner, who will have a large say in how Internet giants including Facebook and Apple use online information from roughly a billion users. That is because the regulator has the power to police any company based in Ireland, and over the past two decades many of the world's largest technology companies have moved their international headquarters there, in large part because of the country's low corporate tax rates.  ''Ireland's data protection watchdog has found itself responsible for protecting the data of a large part of the world's population,'' said Daragh O'Brien, an Irish data protection expert in Dublin. ''It's the first person over the top on any privacy battle.'' Facebook, for example, moved its international headquarters to Dublin five years ago, and roughly 80 percent of its 1.2 billion users are outside North America. The protection of their online data will thus fall to the Irish commissioner's office and to its 31-person staff. Their role will become even more important once the European Union finishes new privacy rules next year that will strengthen the Irish regulator's position as the first port of call for many privacy complaints against American technology companies. The proposed regulations could also lead to fines of up to 5 percent of a company's global revenue, with a maximum of $130 million, if they breach Europe's strict privacy laws. A number of recent privacy cases, including a European court's ruling that gives people the right to ask Google and other search engines to remove links to online content, have also placed increased scrutiny on how tech companies use people's online data. ''The new commissioner will have to balance international issues with domestic privacy concerns,'' said Kate Colleary, a data protection expert at the law firm Eversheds in Dublin. ''Most Irish people don't complain about Facebook or LinkedIn. But with Europe's new regulation, international privacy problems will be front and center.'' The Irish government committee, which meets in a modern office block in central Dublin, is expected to hold a second round of interviews with candidates over the next two weeks and to appoint a new commissioner by the end of September. More than 30 people, including Irish nationals as well as citizens of other countries, applied for the post, and fewer than five are expected to invited for the final interviews. For many, an appointment cannot come soon enough. Billy Hawkes, who has held the position of privacy chief since 2005, will step down by the end of August. John O'Dwyer, a deputy to Mr. Hawkes who has been tipped as a potential successor, will lead the department until a permanent replacement is appointed. Analysts say there has not been overt lobbying from companies seeking to influence who will take over. But privacy advocates remain concerned that the watchdog has not taken a strong enough stance against how tech giants use people's online information. Some privacy groups also complain that the regulator does not have the resources to effectively police companies whose financial muscle far outweighs that of the commissioner, whose annual budget is less than $3 million. The Irish government has said that it will provide extra funds to deal with any increases in regulatory challenges. ''The commission is not up to the test,'' said Joe McNamee, executive director of European Digital Rights, a privacy group in Brussels. ''What's needed is someone with sharp elbows to stand up to companies with a loud voice.'' Mr. Hawkes, the departing data regulator, rejects that he is a soft touch. He says his office has carried out several audits of large tech companies, including Facebook and LinkedIn, and has worked with other data protection agencies in Europe to enact the region's privacy rules. He added that complaints about the commission's work often stem from countries that have complained about Ireland's low corporate tax rates. ''At the back of this debate is a resentment of the Irish tax regime,'' Mr. Hawkes said in an interview earlier this year. ''I am faced with the paradox of devoting a huge amount of resources to international companies that have little impact on Irish residents.'' The commissioner's work has come under scrutiny, however, in a lengthy legal challenge from Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who complained that Facebook routinely broke European data privacy rules. Mr. Schrems has filed more than 20 legal challenges against Facebook with Ireland's data regulator. They include accusations related to Edward J. Snowden, a former contractor of the United States National Security Agency, who has claimed that American intelligence agencies obtained users' data from companies including Facebook. Mr. Schrems says these activities break European privacy rules, and one of his legal challenges was recently referred to Europe's highest court. A decision is not expected until 2016, at the earliest. He also recently filed a class-action lawsuit against the social network, and has secured more than 70,000 signatures in the civil case, whose first hearing will be held in Austria by the end of the year. Mr. Schrems said he had initiated the class-action suit after failing to persuade Ireland's data protection commissioner to clamp down on Facebook's possible abuse of European data privacy rules. ''The biggest tech companies are just ignoring the privacy rules, and nothing happens,'' said Mr. Schrems, who submitted an application to become Ireland's data protection commissioner as part of his campaign to draw attention to the privacy watchdog. ''I don't think the Irish data protection agency has the political backing to truly regulate the industry.'' "
Police in Spain Arm Themselves With Social Media to Fight Crime,"MADRID -- When a European arrest warrant was issued recently for Brett and Naghemeh King, who took their cancer-stricken child out of a Hampshire hospital in the south of England without permission, the Spanish police did what has become increasingly common in the search for missing or wanted people: They posted an alert on Twitter. Within three minutes, the police received a Twitter message saying that the British family's minivan had stopped for gasoline the night before on a highway in Eskoriatza, in northern Spain, and was headed south. In coordination with British authorities, the police centered their search on Spain's touristy southern coast. Two hours later, they received a call from a hotel receptionist near Málaga, who had seen the police alert and checked the license plate number on the minivan. The parents were then detained.  The department's Twitter account, @policia, has become the most popular maintained by a law enforcement agency -- just ahead of the F.B.I.'s -- with a million followers in a country of 47 million people. Police forces in Latin America and elsewhere have visited Spain recently to replicate its police department's Internet strategy. This month, the New York Police Department announced that commanding officers would take a course on using Twitter and how to release better information online about investigations. As Twitter and other social media become more prevalent, however, some police forces have had problems related to privacy laws and the posting of inappropriate messages by individual officers. In New York, the Twitter training is being conducted after a police officer posted a personal message in July that made light of the death of a woman who had fallen onto the subway tracks while using her iPad. In the case of Ashya King, the boy with brain cancer, the police in Hampshire have been under pressure because of their handling of the case, including postings on the Internet. The Hampshire police ''lookout'' alert, accompanied by mug shots, was criticized as portraying the parents as hardened criminals, rather than people seeking alternative medical treatment for their son. On Tuesday, the parents were released from custody in Spain after British prosecutors dropped the case. Under Britain's data protection act, the police have wide latitude to use and spread information. Still, the British police have investigated as many as 828 cases in which officers have been accused of abusing social media, including posting racist and threatening comments, according to documents obtained last month by The Associated Press. Almost 10 percent of the cases ended in the resignation, dismissal or retirement of the accused officers. Isabela Crespo Vitorique, a technology and intellectual property lawyer at Gómez-Acebo & Pombo, a law firm in Madrid, said she was not aware of any court cases involving Spain's police being accused of violating online privacy rules. She said Spain had ''one of the strictest data privacy agencies in Europe,'' but the courts had backed police officers, as well as private detectives, who were using social networks ''as long as it is for professional investigative purposes.'' Still, legal specialists recognized that legislation was struggling to keep pace with technological advances, creating some legal uncertainty as to how aggressive the police could be when using online tools. ''It's going to remain case by case and for the judge to value whatever proofs are presented,'' said Borja Vidaurre Bernal, a partner at VTF Abogados, a media law firm in Madrid. Carlos Fernández Guerra, the social media manager for the Spanish police, said he knew of only one ''minor'' internal police inquiry involving an officer who had posted an inappropriate photo online. Mr. Fernández Guerra, who worked previously as a journalist and in corporate public relations, leads a team of eight police officers who run the media department. In some cases, a police department's online presence increases markedly because of a crisis or major search. The number of followers for the Twitter account of the Boston Police Department rose fivefold after the bombings at the Boston Marathon last year. In Spain, however, the growth in the department's Internet presence has been more gradual and has been coupled with social awareness campaigning. Recent Twitter posts have urged beachgoers not to drive while wearing flip-flops and offered advice on how to erase unwanted photos from applications like WhatsApp. Spain's police have also increasingly gone online to fight Internet fraud. A police alert was recently sent out about a fraudulent ad aimed at clients of Banco Santander, Spain's largest bank by assets. Another important advance, according to Mr. Fernández Guerra, has been so-called tweet raids, intended to guarantee confidentiality to people who help solve dangerous cases. The strategy involves sending a general alert on social media, then inviting people with information to respond to a private email account. Since 2012, the practice has helped in the arrests of more than 500 people suspected of involvement in drug trafficking, according to the Spanish police. Mr. Fernández Guerra conceded that the online drive bothered officers who preferred to work the streets, but he said the strategy was backed by the director general of the national police, Ignacio Cosidó, who took charge in 2012. To soften the formal and institutional image of Spanish law enforcement, some social media campaigns have included jokes or music soundtracks intended to appeal to young people. Mr. Fernández Guerra said the youth response had been quite strong. ''A few years ago, it was unthinkable that an adolescent would want to be in touch with the police,'' he said. "
German Regulator Warns Google Over Collecting Users' Data,"A German privacy regulator has ordered Google to give its users greater control over how their online data is used, in the latest privacy case that challenges how the search giant operates in Europe. The city of Hamburg's data protection regulator, one of Germany's leading data protection agencies, said in a legal ruling that Google must seek Germans' expressed permission before it uses their data to create online user profiles across its services like email, online search and its Android-based mobile products. The watchdog said that Google's ability to aggregate such online data without people's consent could allow the company to ascertain individuals' financial information, relationship status and sexual orientation, which is illegal under German law.  The German regulator acknowledged that Google did not collect this delicate information to target advertising to people online. But it added that other information that the company aggregated without users' consent could nevertheless allow the search giant to form a detailed picture of individual users. Google may face financial penalties of up to 1 million euros, or about $1.27 million, if it does not comply with the regulator's ruling, according to a spokesman for the Hamburg data protection commissioner. In response, Google said that it had worked with the regulator to explain its privacy policies, adding that ''we're now studying their order to determine next steps.'' Google has a month to respond to the ruling, which was based on an investigation that began in April of last year. ''The issue is up to Google now,'' Johannes Caspar, Hamburg's data protection commissioner, said in a statement, adding that the company had made some unspecified changes to how it collects people's online information. ''The company must treat the data of its millions of users in a way that respects their privacy.'' The regulator's comments signal the latest privacy challenge for Google, which has faced similar legal cases brought by other national regulators. In France, the national watchdog fined the company 150,000 euros, or about $190,000, this year for similarly tracking and storing people's online information. Google is also battling on a variety of other legal fronts in Europe. The company is facing renewed antitrust complaints brought by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. And the tech giant has been stung by a recent European court decision that gives Europeans -- and potentially those farther afield -- the right to request that links to online information about themselves be removed from Internet searches. The latest complaint, which was sent to the company last week and made public late on Tuesday, relates to changes in Google's privacy policies in 2012 that consolidated the company's 60 privacy policies into one document, which also allowed the company to start collecting data on users across its online services. As part of the changes, Google is now able to collect information including location-based data when someone uses one of its services, like Google Maps. The search engine also scans individuals' Gmail accounts to filter out spam and to create tailored advertising. The changes did not allow people to opt out of the data collection globally. Mr. Caspar, the Hamburg data commissioner, who previously fined Google $190,000 for illegally collecting personal information from unencrypted German Wi-Fi networks, said the company had not made sufficient changes to give users greater control over how their online information is aggregated. Mr. Caspar added that while Google excluded personally delicate data like sexual orientation from its online advertising products, combining all the user information from across its services could eventually create ''meaningful and comprehensive personal records'' of individuals without their consent. The search giant may also take the case to a local German court if it does not agree with the initial ruling, according to the spokesman for the data protection commissioner. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Estonians Embrace Life in a Digital World,"TALLINN, Estonia -- The centuries-old city center here looks quaintly antique, with well-worn cobbled streets lined by medieval buildings at nearly every turn. But the people have fully embraced the digital world, enthusiastically adopting public and private online services -- offering a snapshot of a society that lives first and foremost online. Estonians, using a national identity card embedded with a microchip, gain access to some 4,000 services, including banking, business registration and even fishing licenses. They review medical records and order prescriptions on smartphones. Almost everyone files taxes on the web within minutes, and about a third of voters now cast their ballots online. While Europe and the United States debate the role of technology in people's daily lives, Estonia has welcomed it as a fact of life, largely shooing away concerns about data privacy that have become hot-button issues elsewhere. In the last 23 years, Estonia, a Baltic country, has transformed from being a member of the Soviet bloc to one of the most connected countries, using technology built primarily within its borders.  The rest of the world -- particularly Europe -- has taken notice. The country's former prime minister, Andrus Ansip, has been tapped to become the new European Commission vice president in charge of Europe's digital future. If he is confirmed for the job by Europe's lawmakers, he will face pressure to improve online privacy and give people greater control over their information, which stands somewhat at odds with Estonia's approach to digital services. During a three-hour nomination hearing in Brussels on Monday, Mr. Ansip trumpeted his support for Europe's privacy agenda. ''We have to protect everyone's privacy,'' he said. ''Trust is a basic principle. If people can't trust e-services, they will never use them.'' But he also pushed the upside of going digital. ''I know from personal experience that paperless government can work,'' he said. With a population of 1.3 million, about the same as in Dallas, Estonia faces fewer challenges than bigger countries like Britain and the United States when introducing online services. And while it remains uncertain whether other countries can follow Estonia's path, it is clear Estonia has little desire to turn back. ''Digital services have changed our lives,'' said Taavi Roivas, who recently succeeded Mr. Ansip as prime minister. ''It's easier to communicate with the state, and there's a lot less bureaucracy.'' The transformation has been made on a small budget. The country spends about 50 million euros, or $63 million, a year on information technology, far from the $700 million spent on HealthCare.gov, the online health insurance marketplace in the United States. Most of the money goes to local companies, some of which began in local research centers started in the Soviet era. In large part, Estonia's decision to go digital also has been driven by one basic fact: It had no other choice. When the Iron Curtain fell, Estonia had few financial resources and a small population to jump-start its economy. Local policy makers also soon realized that they could not offer Western-style services without using new technology, including the Internet, that could keep government costs at a bare minimum. ''Luckily, Estonia was never a rich country,'' said Priit Alamae, chief executive of Nortal, a local company that built much of the technology powering Estonia's digital services. ''We're like a working-class child and had to earn everything on merit.'' While Estonia's online services have expanded rapidly, the system still relies on two staples. All Estonians are issued an identity card at 15, which includes a microchip that holds personal information and allows access to government and commercial services. To keep records safe, each card uses a personal identification number that must be correctly entered before using the digital offerings. The numbers are much harder to compromise than signatures and other forms of online security, analysts say. Estonia also relies on a government-run technology infrastructure, called X-Road, that links public and private databases into the country's digital services. All personal information is kept on separate servers and behind distinct security walls of government agencies, but the system allows the state and businesses like banks to share data when individuals give consent. Estonia's willingness to use digital products sets it apart from France and Germany, where people have objected to keeping data online. Estonians have embraced the concept. The country's systems have recorded few serious security breaches that could test people's faith. And many residents say the online services are more secure and more convenient than traditional methods of dealing with the government. Now, about 98 percent of people file their income taxes online through an automated system that takes roughly five minutes to complete, said Marek Helm, who leads Estonia's tax and customs authority. That has increased overall tax compliance, cut his agency's staff in half, to 1,500 employees, and allowed the government to issue tax refunds within a week. The transition to a digital life has come with a few hiccups. Estonia's online medical portal routinely crashed after digital prescriptions were introduced in 2010 because retirees -- the main users of regular prescriptions -- kept signing into the system to renew their medication on the day they all received monthly social security payments. And some local politicians have voiced concerns that the introduction of Internet voting in 2005 has led to suspicions of election fraud. But Estonians largely view the country's digital services as the standard way of interacting with the government and local companies -- a far cry from the rest of Europe. Citizens are more concerned about frequent government requests for online information than they are about privacy, said Siim Sikkut, a technology adviser to the Estonian government. To prevent people from being bombarded for information, Estonia passed a law that required the authorities to ask only once for specific data, like someone's date of birth. That means local agencies and companies are legally obliged to share basic information when requested, to make it easier for people to use online services. ''If we had a centralized system, it would be a privacy concern,'' said Taavi Kotka, Estonia's chief information officer, during a recent walk through the picturesque center of Tallinn. ''But nobody has the whole picture. Everything is separate, but connected.'' The country now wants to take its digital services global by signing up people living outside Europe for so-called ''e-residency'' that would give people anywhere in the world access to Estonia's public and private online services. The upside, Estonians say, is convenience. ''I can't imagine doing things the old-fashioned way,'' said Priit Heinla, 27, a project manager for an energy company who regularly signs documents with digital signatures on computers or mobile devices. ''You don't have to sign a mountain of paperwork,'' he said. ''It's just one signature and you're done.'' "
Google Provides Details on 'Right to Be Forgotten' Requests,"LONDON - Facebook, and Google's own services, are the latest to be affected by Europe's so-called right to be forgotten, according to figures Google released on Thursday. As part of an update of its online transparency report, Google said that it had removed more links to content on Facebook from its search results than from any other website, in response to people's requests to have links to material expunged to protect their privacy. Two of Google's services - YouTube and the online forum Google Groups - were also among the products most affected by such requests. The links are being removed in response to a European privacy ruling, which allows people to ask that links to information about themselves be removed from online searches unless a compelling public-interest reason exists for retaining the material.  Since the European Union's highest court handed down its privacy decision in May, more than 3,300 links to content on Facebook have been removed. The figure represents 1.9 percent of the 169,500 links to websites that Google has removed in total from its search results, according to the report by the company on Thursday. Facebook declined to comment on the report. A combined 4,300 links to Google's YouTube and Groups services also have been removed, or roughly 2.5 percent of all the links removed. Profile Engine, a social network based in New Zealand, and Badoo, an online dating service, were among the websites with the largest number of links removed, Google's report said. The New York Times and other media organizations have also been notified that links to articles have been removed from some Google search results. The privacy ruling has pitted freedom-of-speech advocates like Jimmy Wales, a founder of Wikipedia, against consumer advocates, who argue that individuals should have the right to seek removal of links to online information about themselves. Unlike in the United States, where the First Amendment protects freedom of speech above privacy rights, the European Union places almost equal weight on people's privacy and freedom of expression. Google's report offers snippets of insight about the decisions its team of legal experts has made while processing the approximately 143,000 requests, related to 491,000 links, that the company has received in the last five months. Examples of the requests, which remain anonymous in compliance with European data protection rules, include a Swiss financial services professional who asked that links to 10 web pages outlining his conviction for financial crimes be removed. Google said it had denied the request. Another request related to a rape victim in Germany who asked that a link to an article about the crime be removed. Google said it had taken down the link. While the decision in those cases would seem clear-cut - there is a clear public interest in publishing information about a business figure's financial crimes, but not in the case of a rape victim - others are more ambiguous. The other requests include the decision in the case of a British man who successfully asked that links to a newspaper report about his guilty plea at a local court be removed. Google said it had taken down the links, which relate to factually accurate information, because British law requires that information about convictions not be held against people after a certain period of time. The search engine's transparency report also provides updated figures about which European countries have submitted the most privacy requests. The right-to-be-forgotten decision allows anyone based in Europe - and potentially those elsewhere - to submit requests to Google. If their submissions are successful, the links will not appear in search results on the company's services with European domains, but will remain open to search on global sites like Google.com. People in France have made roughly 28,500 requests, the largest number of any European country, according to Google's report. People in Germany and Britain,  two of Europe's most populous countries, submitted the second- and third-largest number of requests. Some countries have more successful requests than others. In Italy, for example, about three-quarters of submissions have been rejected, according to Google's report. By contrast, more than half of the submissions from Germany so far have been approved.                       "
"Americans Say They Want Privacy, but Act as if They Don't","Americans say they are deeply concerned about privacy on the web and their cellphones. They say they do not trust Internet companies or the government to protect it. Yet they keep using the services and handing over their personal information. That paradox is captured in a new survey by Pew Research Center. It found that there is no communications channel, including email, cellphones or landlines, that the majority of Americans feel very secure using when sharing personal information. Of all the forms of communication, they trust landlines the most, and fewer and fewer people are using them.  Distrust of digital communication has only increased, Pew found, with the young expressing the most concern by some measures, in the wake of the revelations by Edward Snowden about online surveillance by the government. Yet Americans for now seem to grudgingly accept that these are the trade-offs of living in the digital age -- or else they fear that it is too late to do anything about it. ''The reason is often they don't have real choice,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''It's not like picking up the newspaper and realizing ice cream has too many calories and you can start eating frozen yogurt, information that people can act on.'' One reason is that once people are invested in a service -- if they have all their social contacts on Facebook or years of email on Gmail, for instance -- they have a hard time giving it up. ''It's this modern economy that doesn't really rely on price, but on connections and stickiness,'' Mr. Rotenberg said. ''The companies have done everything they can to make it impossible to go somewhere else.'' Eighty-one percent of people do not feel secure using social media to share private information. Sixty-eight percent feel that way about online chats, 59 percent about text messaging, 57 percent about email, 46 percent about talking on cellphones and 31 percent about talking on landlines. In each case, those who said they were more aware of reports about government surveillance were more likely to say these communications were not secure. People harbor equal distrust of advertisers and the government, Pew found. Eighty percent of users of social networks say they are concerned about advertisers or businesses gaining access to their information there, and 70 percent say they are at least somewhat concerned about the government doing so without their knowledge. Yet highlighting the privacy paradox, 55 percent of people say they are willing to share information about themselves with web companies in order to use their services free, and 36 percent say they appreciate that these services are more efficient because they have access to this information. The types of digital information that people consider to be most sensitive are their Social Security numbers, health information, the content of emails and phone calls and their location. They are least sensitive about their purchasing habits, media consumption, political and religious views, and the identities of their friends. People with more education and higher incomes tend to be more sensitive about their online privacy, Pew found. And despite perceptions that young people care little about digital privacy, they often care more than older people. Email is an example. Just over half of all adults consider the content of email messages to be very sensitive. Fifty-nine percent of young adults feel that way, compared with 42 percent of older adults. ''There's a pretty big, mounting body of evidence that suggests young adults are just as likely to care, if not more so, when it comes to awareness of government surveillance,'' said Mary Madden, a senior researcher for Pew's Internet Project and an author of the report. Pew offered some evidence that people are inured to the trade-offs of using digital services: Ninety-one percent agree or strongly agree that consumers have lost control over how their personal information is collected or used by companies. They are unsure what to do about it, though. Nearly two-thirds say they would like to do more to protect the privacy of their personal information online. About the same number think the government should do more to protect them. There are technical methods for protecting information, like PGP, a data encryption tool. But broader fixes would most likely come through policy changes, privacy advocates say. ''The privacy survivalists will start exchanging PGP key prints, but that's not going to work for most people,'' Mr. Rotenberg said. ''I think more needs to be done at the macro policy level to restore trust: update federal privacy laws, limit circumstances under which government gets access and mandate better security.'' The question is whether policy makers or their constituents will push for that -- or whether they, too, have accepted privacy trade-offs as a fact of living life online.

"Clicks, Not Gold Stars","HUNTER, N.Y. -- For better or for worse, the third graders in Greg Fletcher's class at Hunter Elementary School always know where they stand. One morning in mid-October, Mr. Fletcher walked to the front of the classroom where an interactive white board displayed ClassDojo, a behavior-tracking app that lets teachers award points or subtract them based on a student's conduct. On the board was a virtual classroom showing each student's name, a cartoon avatar and the student's scores so far that week. ''I'm going to have to take a point for no math homework,'' Mr. Fletcher said to a blond boy in a striped shirt and then clicked on the boy's avatar, a googly-eyed green monster, and subtracted a point. The program emitted a disappointed pong sound, audible to the whole class -- and sent a notice to the child's parents if they had signed up for an account on the service.  ClassDojo is used by at least one teacher in roughly one out of three schools in the United States, according to its developer. The app is among the innovations to emerge from the estimated $7.9 billion education software market aimed at students from prekindergarten through high school. Although there are similar behavior-tracking programs, they are not as popular as ClassDojo. Many teachers say the app helps them automate the task of recording classroom conduct, as well as allowing them to communicate directly with parents. But some parents, teachers and privacy law scholars say ClassDojo, along with other unproven technologies that record sensitive information about students, is being adopted without sufficiently considering the ramifications for data privacy and fairness, like where and how the data might eventually be used. These critics also say that the carrot-and-stick method of classroom discipline is outmoded, and that behavior apps themselves are too subjective, enabling teachers to reward or penalize students for amorphous acts like ''disrespect.'' They contend that behavior databases could potentially harm students' reputations by unfairly saddling some with ''a problem child'' label that could stick with them for years. ClassDojo does not seek explicit parental consent for teachers to log detailed information about a child's conduct. Although the app's terms of service state that teachers who sign up guarantee that their schools have authorized them to do so, many teachers can download ClassDojo, and other free apps, without vetting by school supervisors. Neither the New York City nor Los Angeles school districts, for example, keep track of teachers independently using apps. If parents wish to remove their child's data from ClassDojo, they must ask the teacher or email the company. ''There is a real question in my mind as to whether teachers have the authority to sign up on behalf of the school,'' said Steven J. McDonald, the general counsel of the Rhode Island School of Design and a leading specialist on federal education privacy law. ''Since this is a free service,'' he added, ''one wonders if there is some other trade-off.'' Sam Chaudhary, the co-founder of ClassDojo, said his company recently updated its privacy policy to say that it does not ''sell, lease or share your (or children's) personal information to any third party'' for advertising or marketing. ''We have committed in the terms of service to never selling the data,'' Mr. Chaudhary said. ''It's the user's own data.'' The company plans to generate revenue by marketing additional services, like more detailed behavior analyses, to parents. But ClassDojo could make money from the information it collects in other ways. Another section of the privacy policy says the company may show users advertisements ''based in part on your personally identifiable information.'' Mr. Chaudhary said ClassDojo gave students feedback as a way of encouraging them to develop skills like leadership and teamwork. Some special-education teachers also use the program to set individualized goals with students and their parents. ''Kids are being judged at school every day,'' Mr. Chaudhary said. ''They are just being judged on a narrow set of things. If we can broaden that set, it's a good thing.'' But critics say that the kind of classroom discipline that Class Dojo promotes is not made effective by packaging it in an app that awards virtual badges for obedience. ''This is just a flashy digital update of programs that have long been used to treat children like pets, bribing or threatening them into compliance,'' said Alfie Kohn, the author of ''The Myth of the Spoiled Child'' and other books on learning and child-rearing. Teachers who use ClassDojo can choose which behaviors to reward or discourage. Kelly Connolly-Hickey, an English teacher at West Babylon Senior High School in West Babylon, N.Y., rewards students who ''brought in supplies'' or ''brightened someone's day'' while docking points for cellphone use. ''Knowing that they are being graded on how they behave and participate every day makes it easier for them to stay on task,'' Ms. Connolly-Hickey said of her students. She added that she had not read ClassDojo's policies on handling student data, but that she had shown the principal of her school how she used the app. ''I'm one of those people who, when the terms of service are 18 pages, I just click agree,'' she said. Teachers can decide whether to display students' points or to use the system in private mode. Mr. Fletcher, the third-grade teacher, said he used ClassDojo publicly in an effort to be transparent. He deliberately awards many more points for good behavior than subtracts them for being off-task. Last month, after a well-mannered class discussion about the motivations of characters in a picture book, Mr. Fletcher invited each student to the white board to award him- or herself a point for teamwork. With each point, the app emitted a contented ping. ''I don't ever award the kids points or take away points without them knowing,'' he said. ''What I am trying to do is put the ownership back on the kid.'' Melinda McCool, the school's principal, said she felt Mr. Fletcher used the app judiciously, and had asked him to show other teachers how he used it. But at least one school is concerned that the app could make a student feel publicly shamed. ''I have told all my staff, 'You cannot display this data publicly,' '' said Matt Renwick, the principal of Howe Elementary School in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis. His school also requires teachers to obtain permission from a child's parent before they start using any app that transfers the student's data to a company. Parents are also divided over ClassDojo. Some like being able to use the app to follow their child's progress and receive reports from teachers. ''It's a great way to get the prognosis on your child,'' said Gabrielle Canezin, whose daughter is in Mr. Fletcher's class. But Tony Porterfield, a software engineer in Los Altos, Calif., asked a teacher to remove his son's information from ClassDojo. He said he was concerned that it might later be aggregated and analyzed in unforeseen ways. ''It creates a label for a child,'' he said. ''It's a little early to be doing that to my 6-year-old.'' ClassDojo has received nearly $10 million from investors, including General Catalyst Partners, Shasta Ventures, New Schools Venture Fund, Paul Graham and Yuri Milner. Mr. Chaudhary says he and his team have studied ClassDojo's effectiveness by visiting classrooms, conducting weekly phone calls with a few dozen teachers, and surveying 1,000 teachers. Such an anecdotal approach does not sit well with evidence-based educators. ''That's like polling people in McDonald's about how they like the food,'' said Brett Clark, the director of technology at Greater Clark County Schools in Jeffersonville, Ind. ''They are not asking the teachers who looked at the app, walked away and said, 'Not in my classroom.' '' "
What Are the Best Teaching Methods for Getting Students to Behave Well in Class?,"Have you ever been in a class where all the students were focused and engaged? And the class seemed to run perfectly? Or have you experienced the opposite - where most students were misbehaving or, at the very least, distracted? Why do students behave in one teacher's class - but then misbehave in another's?   What are the best teaching methods for getting students to stay focused in class?  In ""Privacy Concerns for ClassDojo and Other Tracking Apps for Schoolchildren,"" Natasha Singer writes: For better or for worse, the third graders in Greg Fletcher's class at Hunter Elementary School always know where they stand. One morning in mid-October, Mr. Fletcher walked to the front of the classroom where an interactive white board displayed ClassDojo, a behavior-tracking app that lets teachers award points or subtract them based on a student's conduct. On the board was a virtual classroom showing each student's name, a cartoon avatar and the student's scores so far that week. ""I'm going to have to take a point for no math homework,"" Mr. Fletcher said to a blond boy in a striped shirt and then clicked on the boy's avatar, a googly-eyed green monster, and subtracted a point. The program emitted a disappointed pong sound, audible to the whole class - and sent a notice to the child's parents if they had signed up for an account on the service. ClassDojo is used by at least one teacher in roughly one out of three schools in the United States, according to its developer. The app is among the innovations to emerge from the estimated $7.9 billion education software market aimed at students from prekindergarten through high school. Although there are similar behavior-tracking programs, they are not as popular as ClassDojo. Many teachers say the app helps them automate the task of recording classroom conduct, as well as allowing them to communicate directly with parents. But some parents, teachers and privacy law scholars say ClassDojo, along with other unproven technologies that record sensitive information about students, is being adopted without sufficiently considering the ramifications for data privacy and fairness, like where and how the data might eventually be used. These critics also say that the carrot-and-stick method of classroom discipline is outmoded, and that behavior apps themselves are too subjective, enabling teachers to reward or penalize students for amorphous acts like ""disrespect."" They contend that behavior databases could potentially harm students' reputations by unfairly saddling some with ""a problem child"" label that could stick with them for years.  Students: Read the entire article, then tell us ... - What do you think are the best teaching methods for getting students to behave well in class? What motivates you to stay focused? Have you ever behaved well in one teacher's class and misbehaved in another's? Why? - The article reports on ClassDojo, a popular behavior tracking app used by many teachers.

French Official Campaigns to Make 'Right to be Forgotten' Global,"Europe is pressing for its ''right to be forgotten'' ruling to go global. The privacy decision, which allows individuals to ask that links leading to information about themselves be removed from search engine results, has been gaining traction worldwide ever since European officials released guidelines last week that demanded Google and others apply the ruling across their entire search empires.  And on Wednesday, Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who heads the French data protection authority and has campaigned heavily for expanding the ruling, defended European efforts to force search engines to apply the ruling to search results outside of Europe. Currently, Google, which controls about 80 percent of Europe's search market, removes links only from its local domains, like Google.fr in France and  Google.de in Germany, while other domains, like Google.com, are not affected. That allows individuals - both in European and farther afield - to sidestep Europe's privacy rules as long as they use a non-European search domain. But Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, who also heads a European body composed of the region's 28 national privacy regulators, said Google must remove links globally and not just from its European domains,  adding that such a step was essential to protect every European's right to privacy. ''For Google, the answer is worldwide,'' said Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, when questioned about the scope of the European ruling. ''If people have the right to  be delisted from search results, then that should happen worldwide.'' The expansion of the ruling beyond Europe's borders has raised questions over whether the region's regulators would be able to enforce the decision in  other jurisdictions like the United  States, which do not have the same privacy rules. Yet Ms. Falque-Pierrotin defended Europe's efforts, saying that as long as a European resident had requested that online links be removed, then any  search engine must comply with that decision across the globe. ''The location of the search user, not the search engine, is the most important,'' Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, who added  that her agency had received roughly  100 complaints from French residents  about how their ""right to be forgotten"" requests had been handled by Google.  ''Now that we have the guidelines, we'll start to investigate each case,'' she said, in reference to policies that  Europe's privacy chief announced last  week. Under the current rules, individuals must first submit requests to Google about links that they want removed from online search results. So far, the search giant has received almost 180,000 requests and has removed about 41 percent of these links, according to the company's transparency report. If  individuals are not satisfied with Google's response, they can ask a country's data regulator to intervene. Ever since Europe's highest court made the privacy ruling in May, Google has fought to limit the impact of the decision to its European operations, where  an individual's right to privacy is often on par with freedom of expression. The opposite is true in the United States. "
Uber Responds to Senator Franken's Privacy Concerns,"Facing increased scrutiny from lawmakers and members of the media, Uber on Monday defended its privacy practices on Monday, laying out some of its policies in response to an inquiry from Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, sent last month.  In the letter, which was addressed to Senator Franken and written by Katherine M. Tassi, Uber's managing counsel for privacy, the company challenged what it has said were misconceptions about how Uber treats the private travel data of its users.  ""Uber has always had a strong culture of protecting rider information, and Uber prohibits employees from accessing rider personal information except for legitimate business purposes,"" the letter, which was first obtained by BuzzFeed, said. The letter comes on the heels of a rough few weeks for the start-up, which lets users hail a private car through the use of a smartphone app. Uber has faced intense criticism after a BuzzFeed report that said one of Uber's top executives suggested the company do ""opposition research"" on journalists who were critical of the company.  Another report said that an Uber employee had looked into the private Uber travel history of a BuzzFeed reporter. Shortly thereafter, Senator Franken sent a letter asking the start-up to lay bare the way it handles sensitive rider data.  In its response, Uber said it had taken extra steps to implement additional safeguards to its privacy practices over the years, as the start-up has exploded from a few hundred employees to more than 2,000 employees around the globe.  The company also said that it had disciplined Josh Mohrer, the employee who accessed the travel data of a BuzzFeed employee. The letter did not explain what punishment Mr. Mohrer was given.  "
Privacy Concerns a Challenge For Retailers,"DAVOS, Switzerland - As technology rapidly increases the amount of personal data that is readily available, companies are trying to strike a balance between better tailoring their message to consumers and protecting an individual's privacy, said Doug McMillon, the incoming chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores said Thursday.  Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum, Mr. McMillon said that the retailing giant routinely discusses internally how to better reach customers through technology, but is well aware of how quickly a consumer's trust can evaporate if a retailer goes about it in the wrong way. ""We are people and we are families,"" Mr. McMillon said. ""We have to do it in a way that makes people comfortable and builds trust as we go,"" Mr. McMillon said Wal-Mart is ""becoming more of a tech company,"" using innovations to streamline its supply chain and to create a better experience for customers. In Britain, customers of its Asda unit shop using their mobile phones and then pick up their items at a drive-through, Mr. McMillon said. Paul E. Jacobs, the chairman and C.E.O. of the wireless company Qualcomm, said that his company is working on technology in which consumers will soon be able to receive information and offers for products tailored to their buying habits on their mobile phone or other devices when they approach a store display. It will be built in a way so that people have to agree to receive such offers, in the name of privacy, he said. ""In the future you'll get notifications all around you, for breaking news, for health,"" Mr. Jacobs said. ""It's not on the phone. It will come to your wrist, your ear, your glasses."" Maurice Lévy, the chairman and C.E.O. of the advertising company Publicis, said technology can be ""extremely useful"" in tailoring advertising to ""the right person at the right time."" That said, a person's interest in a product doesn't always result in sales. ""We should never forget about that: they are human beings, they have the right to think different, they have the right to think with their emotions,"" Mr. Lévy said. ""At the end, there is a kind of alchemy delivering this message to the right person.""  "
InBloom Student Data Repository to Close,"In a setback for the nearly $8 billion prekindergarten through 12th-grade education technology software market, inBloom, a non-profit corporation offering to warehouse and manage student data for public school districts across the country, announced on Monday morning that it planned to shut its doors. Financed with $100 million in seed money from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation along with the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the venture promised to streamline how teachers and administrators accessed student records. The system was meant to extract student data from disparate school grading and attendance databases, store it in the cloud and funnel it to dashboards where teachers might more effectively track the progress of individual students.  But the project ran into roadblocks in a number of districts and states over privacy and security issues. The inBloom database included more than 400 different data fields about students that school administrators could fill in. But some of the details seemed so intimate - including family relationships (""foster parent"" or ""father's significant other"") and reasons for enrollment changes (""withdrawn due to illness"" or ""leaving school as a victim of a serious violent incident"") - that parents objected, saying that they did not want that kind of information about their children transferred to a third-party vendor. That led some schools to recoil from the venture. After parents in Louisiana discovered that their children's Social Security numbers had been uploaded to inBloom, Louisiana officials said last year that they would remove all student data from the database. Subsequently, the school board of the Jeffco district, in Jefferson County, Colo., voted to end its relationship with inBloom. This month, after New York state legislators passed legislation prohibiting the state department of education from giving student information to data aggregators like inBloom, education officials also reversed their plans to use the service. The idea of using data-mining to tailor learning for students may be promising. But the story of inBloom suggests that many parents remain leery. In a statement on Monday morning, Iwan Streichenberger, the chief executive of inBloom, said that personalized learning was still an emerging concept. He said that inBloom, as an infrastructure layer of that ecosystem, had been ""the subject of mischaracterizations and a lightning rod for misdirected criticism."" He added that inBloom would wind down over the coming months. ""We stepped up to the occasion and supported our partners with passion,"" Mr. Streichenberger said in the statement, ""but we have realized that this concept is still new, and building public acceptance for the solution will require more time and resources than anyone could have anticipated."" Following is the full statement from inBloom. Friends and colleagues: In 2011, an alliance of educators and state leaders, non-profit foundations, and instructional content and tool providers formed the Shared Learning Collaborative (SLC). The vision of that group was simple: create a resource that allows teachers to get a more complete picture of student progress so they can individualize instruction while saving time, effort and precious resources. I signed on to the project in November 2012 to lead inBloom, the nonprofit corporation that is the SLC's successor. I joined because I passionately believe that technology has the potential to dramatically improve education. My belief in that mission is as strong today as it ever was. Students, teachers and parents deserve the best tools and resources available, and we cannot afford to wait. Over the last year, the incredibly talented team at inBloom has developed and introduced a technical solution that addresses the complex challenges that teachers, educators and parents face when trying to best utilize the student data available to them. That solution can provide a high impact and cost-effective service to every school district across the country, enabling teachers to more easily tailor education to students' individual learning needs. It is a shame that the progress of this important innovation has been stalled because of generalized public concerns about data misuse, even though inBloom has world-class security and privacy protections that have raised the bar for school districts and the industry as a whole. The use of technology to tailor instruction for individual students is still an emerging concept and inBloom provides a technical solution that has never been seen before. As a result, it has been the subject of mischaracterizations and a lightning rod for misdirected criticism. In New York, these misunderstandings led to the recent passage of legislation severely restricting the education department from contracting with outside companies like inBloom for storing, organizing, or aggregating student data, even where those companies provide demonstrably more protection for privacy and security than the systems currently in use. We stepped up to the occasion and supported our partners with passion, but we have realized that this concept is still new, and building public acceptance for the solution will require more time and resources than anyone could have anticipated. Therefore, in full alignment with the inBloom Board of Directors and funders, I have made the decision to wind down the organization over the coming months. It wasn't an easy decision, and the unavailability of this technology is a real missed opportunity for teachers and school districts seeking to improve student learning. I want to thank you for your partnership in our endeavors and look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming months. Kind regards,Iwan StreichenbergerChief Executive Officer "
"Quantifying Privacy: A Week of Location Data May Be an ""Unreasonable Search""","When does the simple digital tracking of your location and movements - the GPS bleeps from most of our smartphones - start to be truly revealing? When do the data points and inferences that can be drawn from it strongly suggest, say, trips to a psychiatrist, a mosque, an abortion clinic, a strip club or an AIDS treatment center? The answer, according to a new research paper, is about a week, when the data portrait of a person becomes sufficiently detailed to qualify as an ""unreasonable search"" and a potential violation of an individual's Fourth Amendment rights.  The research paper, a collaboration of computer scientists and lawyers, wades into the debate over the legal and policing implications of modern data collection and analysis technology. It explores what in legal circles is called the ""mosaic theory"" of the Fourth Amendment, which essentially states that when linked and analyzed by software, a much richer picture emerges from combined information than from discrete data points. ""It's not the direct observation,"" said Steven M. Bellovin, one of the paper's co-authors and a computer science professor at Columbia University, a computer security and privacy expert and a former chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission. ""It's what can be inferred."" The main technology for making these inferences is machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence. In the paper, the authors write that their goal was ""to identify the threshold at which enough is enough - the point at which long-term government surveillance becomes objectively unreasonable."" In the interview, Mr. Bellovin observed, ""We put it at a week, based on our research."" One reason the technology works so well, Mr. Bellovin said, is that people help, by following patterns of movement that are quite predictable. When combined with other data, the result is something close to a movement fingerprint - that is, surprisingly distinctive and identifying. The 74-page paper, ""When Enough Is Enough: Location Tracking, Mosaic Theory, and Machine Learning,"" has been published in the current edition of the New York University Journal of Law and Liberty. Its co-authors, in addition to Mr. Bellovin, are: Renee M. Hutchins, an associate professor at the University of Maryland Carey School of Law; Tony Jebara, an associate professor of computer science at Columbia, and a machine learning expert; and Sebastian Zimmeck, a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Columbia, who is also a lawyer. The issue of when location data and analysis might constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment came up most prominently in a Supreme Court case, United States v. Jones, in 2012. The Supreme Court discussed the data-privacy issues, but it decided the case based on other grounds. In the case, Antoine Jones, a nightclub owner in Washington, D.C., was suspected by the police of dealing drugs. The local police, working with federal agents, put a GPS tracking device on his car, without a warrant, and gathered his location data for four weeks. Mr. Jones was initially convicted of drug trafficking conspiracy, based in part on thousands of pages of location information sent from the GPS tracker over 28 days. The Supreme Court ruled for Mr. Jones, saying his Fourth Amendment rights had been violated because placing the GPS device on his car, without a warrant and without his knowledge, was ""an unauthorized physical intrusion,"" as if someone had come into his home. But the justices discussed the subject of modern data tracking and its potential to reveal ""intimate facts"" about a person's life. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that based on data trails, it would be possible to detect trips of an ""indisputably private nature."" In her list that would take ""little imagination to conjure,"" she cited the trips to a psychiatrist, abortion clinic, AIDS treatment center, strip club and mosque - mentioned above - but she also included trips to a criminal defense lawyer, a by-the-hour motel and a union meeting. Justice Samuel Alito stated that four weeks of location data collection, without a warrant, was ""surely too long,"" in that it would be enough for a detailed portrait of a person's behavior. But Justice Antonin Scalia noted in his majority opinion that ""it remains unexplained why a four-week investigation is 'surely too long.' "" ""That's a fair critique,"" observed Ms. Hutchins, the University of Maryland law professor. ""We wanted to see what the science showed."" The 2012 court case was exceptional in that it involved a location tracking device surreptitiously affixed to someone's car by the police. Most of us willingly carry our own tracking devices, smartphones. You can turn off the GPS tracking, but then you lose all location services like Foursquare and the Google Maps feature that guides you to a destination. There are some state-by-state differences, Mr. Bellovin said, but in most of the country, if a law-enforcement agency asks a mobile carrier for location data from cell towers, it gets it. Often, he said, the location information is disclosed without a subpoena, but even getting a subpoena requires only that the police certify to a judge that the information is ""relevant to an ongoing investigation."" By contrast, a search warrant requires ""probable cause"" and ""particularity,"" meaning the name of a person and a location. The one-week threshold identified in the research paper would change police practice, especially at a time when big data technology is being applied to the emerging field of ""predictive policing."" Today, predictive policing software forecasts - almost like a weather forecast - where crimes are more likely to occur and when, rather than who specifically might commit a crime. But Mr. Bellovin suggests that the vision of the 2002 movie ""Minority Report,"" based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, of ""pre-crime"" squads identifying people likely to commit crimes is getting less fantastic all the time.  ""It's science fiction,"" he said, ""but we're not that far from there in certain circumstances."" Paraphrasing the Vichy police captain played by Claude Rains in the movie ""Casablanca,"" Mr. Bellovin said, ""Round up the probable suspects, based on the data."" What can be done with data now and in the near-future, Mr. Bellovin said, is why the subject of its collection and use in law enforcement is important. ""We need to have a public debate about this,"" he said.                       "
F.B.I. Director Hints at Action as Google and Apple Lock Up Cellphone Data,"WASHINGTON -- The director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, said on Thursday that the ''post-Snowden pendulum'' that has driven Apple and Google to offer fully encrypted cellphones had ''gone too far.'' He hinted that as a result, the administration might seek regulations and laws forcing companies to create a way for the government to unlock the photos, emails and contacts stored on the phones. But Mr. Comey appeared to have few answers for critics who have argued that any portal created for the F.B.I. and the police could be exploited by the National Security Agency, or even Russian and Chinese intelligence agencies or criminals. And his position seemed to put him at odds with a White House advisory committee that recommended against any effort to weaken commercial encryption. Apple and Google have announced new software that would automatically encrypt the contents of cellphones, using codes that even the companies could not crack. Their announcement followed a year of disclosures from Edward J. Snowden, the former government contractor who revealed many government programs that collect electronic data, including information on Americans.  The new encryption would hinder investigations involving phones taken from suspects, recovered at crime scenes or discovered on battlefields. But it would not affect information obtained by real-time wiretaps, such as phone conversations, emails or text messages. And the government could still get information that is stored elsewhere, including emails, call logs and, in some cases, old text messages. But F.B.I. agents see the encryption as a beachhead they cannot afford to lose. With the latest software, the new phones will be the first widely used consumer products to encrypt data by default. If that is allowed to stand, investigators fear other technology companies will follow suit. If all desktop computers and laptops were encrypted, it would stymie all kinds of criminal investigations, they say. Mr. Comey's position has set up a potentially difficult struggle between law enforcement agencies and the nation's high-technology manufacturers, who have rebuffed the government's demands for a way to decode data. It has also touched off a debate inside the government that highlights the difference between cybersecurity and traditional crime fighting. Any technology that allows the United States government to bypass encryption in the name of solving crimes could also allow hackers and foreign governments to bypass encryption in the name of stealing secrets. Justice Department officials and company representatives have discussed these issues privately. Some Obama administration officials believe that the companies would be successful in killing any legislation that seems to weaken privacy protections and that it makes no sense to pick a public fight with Apple and Google or push for new legislation. Just 10 months ago Mr. Obama's advisory committee on the N.S.A., created in light of the Snowden disclosures, recommended that the government ''not in any way subvert, undermine, weaken or make vulnerable generally available commercial software.'' The committee also recommended that the government ''increase the use of encryption and urge U.S. companies to do so.'' Mr. Comey made no reference to that report in an hourlong speech and discussion at the Brookings Institution, and White House officials have said they are still struggling to come up with a policy for Mr. Obama to adopt. While Apple and Google declined to respond to Mr. Comey's speech, just last week, at an event in Palo Alto, Calif., executives of several companies made clear they would not slow their efforts to offer encryption. In fact, they said, the effort would accelerate, and they would develop algorithms that would take the government months or years to crack, and then insist that consumers themselves create their own encryption keys so that the companies would be unable to crack the code or provide it to the government. Colin Stretch, the general counsel for Facebook, called encryption ''a key business objective'' for technology companies. ''I'd be fundamentally surprised if anybody takes the foot off the pedal of building encryption into their products,'' he said. Mr. Comey's complaint is that technology is vastly outpacing the ability to assure that authorities can track suspects however they communicate -- by cellphone, text message or over a smartphone app. Four years ago the F.B.I. pressed to update a 20-year-old law that required traditional communication providers -- like AT & T or Verizon -- to build into their systems an ability to immediately comply with wiretap orders. But many different companies, including small start-ups and foreign firms, now transmit communications. The F.B.I.'s effort to require many kinds of companies to provide unencrypted, plain-text information to the government if served with a court order failed. Last year the F.B.I. called back its proposal so that companies would still be permitted to offer messaging that would be entirely encrypted between users. The Snowden disclosures about the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency killed all those proposals. Now Mr. Comey appears to be going even further, seeking a way into data stored on phones even if it is never transmitted. And he wants to make sure that Apple, or other phone manufacturers, do not ''throw away the key'' that allows that information to be unencrypted. The companies, meanwhile, are going the other way: They want to convince customers that their data will be private, even from the phone's maker. ''Just as people won't put their money in a bank they won't trust, people won't use an Internet they won't trust,'' Brad Smith, the general counsel for Microsoft, said recently. Recognizing America's suspicion of government surveillance, Mr. Comey has based his argument on the need to conduct investigations into child pornographers and kidnappers, not terrorists. The office of the director of national intelligence and the N.S.A. have deliberately stayed out of this argument, leaving the issue to Mr. Comey. But under questioning from Benjamin Wittes, a cybersecurity expert at Brookings, and from reporters and audience members, Mr. Comey made clear he was speaking only for the F.B.I. As a result, he made no commitment that the N.S.A. or other American intelligence agencies would never exploit the technology that could unencrypt data. Mr. Snowden's revelations, backed up by classified documents, were rife with examples of how the agency secretly tapped into communications lines between Google's servers -- then still unencrypted -- to drain out data, and took similar steps to find holes in encryption systems marketed by American companies. While the presidential commission found no evidence that the government had created a ''backdoor'' that gave the United States unauthorized access to data, it concluded that ''the use of encryption should be greatly expanded to protect not only data in transit, but also data at rest on networks, in storage and in the cloud.'' Mr. Comey did not specify what kind of technological fix he wanted, other than to say that if the companies built one into their software, it would be far easier to assure that it was not exploited by others. But he also said that ''we may get to a place where the U.S. Congress forces this'' on American manufacturers. "
Neiman Marcus Investigates Breach Involving Credit Card Data,"SAN FRANCISCO - Neiman Marcus is investigating a security breach involving credit card information stolen from its customers. The breach, reported late Friday by Brian Krebs, a security blogger, was confirmed by Neiman Marcus.  The retailer, based in Texas, said it began investigating reports of fraudulent activity on credit cards belonging to customers who had shopped in its stores in mid-December and discovered that its systems had been intruded. The company said some customers' credit card details may have been stolen, but did not say how many records were potentially compromised. Neiman Marcus said it had informed federal law enforcement agencies and was working with the Secret Service, credit card companies, a payment processor, an investigations firm and a forensics firm to investigate. The company said that on Jan. 1, the forensics firm discovered evidence that the company had been breached and that some credit card information was possibly compromised. ""We have begun to contain the intrusion and have taken significant steps to further enhance information security,"" the company said, adding it was notifying customers whose cards were used fraudulently after making a Neiman Marcus purchase. The news followed an update on Friday by Target, the retailer based in Minneapolis, which revised the number of customers whose personal and payment information was stolen in a widespread hacking.  "
Home Depot Data Breach Could Be the Largest Yet,"Home Depot confirmed on Monday that hackers had broken into its in-store payments systems, in what could be the largest known breach of a retail company's computer network. The retailer said the exact number of customers affected was still not clear. But a person briefed on the investigation said the total number of credit card numbers stolen at Home Depot could top 60 million. By comparison, the breach last year at Target, the largest known attack to date, affected 40 million cardholders. The breach may have affected any customer at Home Depot stores in the United States and Canada from April to early last week, said Paula Drake, a company spokeswoman. Customers at Home Depot's Mexico stores were not affected, nor were online shoppers at HomeDepot.com. Personal identification numbers for debit cards were not taken, she said.  Home Depot has not yet confirmed other details. The retailer operates 1,977 stores in the United States and 180 in Canada. That is about 400 more than Target had when it was compromised. Target's breach went on for three weeks before the company learned about it, while the attack at Home Depot went unnoticed for as long as five months. ''Honestly, Home Depot is in trouble here,'' said Eric W. Cowperthwaite, vice president of Core Security, an Internet-security consulting company. Mr. Cowperthwaite noted that it was a security blogger, Brian Krebs, not the company, that first reported the breach. ''This is not how you handle a significant security breach, nor will it provide any sort of confidence that Home Depot can solve the problem going forward,'' Mr. Cowperthwaite said. Last week, before Home Depot confirmed the attack, customers in Georgia had already filed a class-action lawsuit against the retailer for failing to protect customers from fraud and not alerting them to the breach in a timely manner. Home Depot said it would offer free identity protection and credit-monitoring services to any customer who had used a credit or debit card at any of its affected stores. Since the breach at Home Depot first came to executives' attention last Tuesday, the company said it had been working with two security companies, Symantec and FishNet Security, to investigate. Home Depot is unlikely to be the last big retailer to suffer a breach of its cash register systems. Hackers have for some time been scanning merchants' networks for ways to gain remote access, such as through outside contractors who have access to a computer network. Once they find that opening, they install so-called malware that is undetectable by antivirus products. The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service recently estimated that more than 1,000 businesses in the United States had been infected with malware that is programmed to siphon payment card details from cash registers in stores. They believed that many of these businesses did not even know they were sharing customers' credit card information. Besides Home Depot and Target, among the companies that have been hacked are U.P.S., Goodwill, P. F. Chang's, Sally Beauty, Michael's and Neiman Marcus. Security experts believe that the same group of criminals in Eastern Europe is behind the attacks, according to several people briefed on the results of forensics investigations who were not allowed to speak publicly because of nondisclosure agreements. Buried in the malware used in the Home Depot attack were links to websites that reference the United States role in the conflict in Ukraine. In each case, the entry point has differed, according to one law enforcement official. At Target, it was thought to be a Pennsylvania company that provided heating, air conditioning and refrigeration services to the retailer. The entry points for the other businesses are still unknown. Studies have found that retailers, in particular, are unprepared for such attacks. A joint study by the Ponemon Institute, an independent security research firm, and DB Networks, a database security firm, found that a majority of computer security experts in the United States believed that their organizations lacked the technology and tools to quickly detect database attacks. Only one-third of those experts said they did the kind of continuous monitoring needed to identify irregular activity in their databases, and 22 percent acknowledged that they did not scan at all. After Home Depot confirmed the breach on Monday, a retail lobbying group in Washington said it was time the industry worked together to combat such threats. ''Any organization connected to the debit and credit card ecosystem faces constant and evolving threats,'' said Sandy Kennedy, president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association. ''The public and private sector must continue to work together to improve debit and credit card security, identify threats and share information to best defend against cyberattacks.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Home Depot Confirms Largest Retail Data Breach,"Updated, 8:21 p.m. | SAN FRANCISCO -- Home Depot said on Thursday that the account information of 56 million cardholders was compromised in what is the largest known breach of a retail company's computer network. Home Depot said hackers breached the company's cash register systems in its United States and Canadian stores in April. The hackers, the company said, used custom malware that was designed to evade traditional security tools and had not been previously used in other cyberattacks. The company said that it had since removed infected registers and closed off the hackers' mode of entry and that it had been using new encryption systems in its American and Canadian stores for the last nine months.  Home Depot has been scrambling to investigate the breach since it became public on Sept. 8. It is unclear how the company missed signs of the attack after a breach last year at Target compromised 40 million cardholders' information, and after the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security warned retailers in July that their systems were potentially compromised. The company said its encryption project began in January but was not completed in its American stores until Saturday. It said encryption in its Canadian stores would not be completed until 2015. Home Depot's attack went unnoticed for five months. During that time, hackers found an entry into the company's network, gained access to its in-store payment systems and installed malware to take payment data off the memory of the company's registers during processing. The hackers then sent that data back to their servers abroad. Home Depot said it would offer free identity protection and credit monitoring services to any customer who had used a credit or debit card at affected stores. ''We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and anxiety this has caused, and want to reassure them that they will not be liable for fraudulent charges,'' Frank Blake, Home Depot's chief executive, said in a statement. Security experts and law enforcement say that hackers are actively scanning merchants' networks for ways to gain remote access to their systems. The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service recently estimated that more than 1,000 businesses in the United States had been infected with malware programmed to siphon payment card details from cash registers. They believed that many of these businesses did not know they were sharing customers' credit card information. Besides Home Depot and Target, companies that have been attacked by hackers include UPS, Goodwill, P. F. Chang's, Sally Beauty, Michael's and Neiman Marcus. The only way to thwart such attacks, security experts say, is for merchants to adopt a new chip-based payment standard known as E.M.V., short for Europay MasterCard and Visa, the technology's first backers. The technology makes it more difficult for criminals to use stolen account information to make purchases or create counterfeit cards. Home Depot said that moving to E.M.V. required writing tens of thousands of lines of new software code and deploying it to 85,000 new PIN pads in its stores. It said on Thursday that E.M.V. already existed in its Canadian stores but would not be introduced in its United States stores until the end of the year. Credit card companies have set an October 2015 deadline for American retailers to upgrade their payment systems. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
N.S.A. Director Makes Another Visit to Silicon Valley,"PALO ALTO, Calif. - Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, said on Monday that a secure Internet was in the best interest of the United States, following disclosures that the N.S.A. had been exploiting weaknesses in the web for foreign intelligence gathering.  Admiral Rogers took over the post of N.S.A. director in April as the agency faced criticism over its mass-surveillance program, and particularly its efforts to undermine digital encryption and exploit security flaws to spy on foreigners, after the revelations by the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden.   Since then, technology companies like Google and Yahoo have taken significant steps to encrypt their data, both when it is stored and as it flows through their own data centers, because Mr. Snowden's revelations showed the N.S.A. was gathering it in an unencrypted form as it passed between computers. More recently, Apple and Google have taken steps to encrypt mobile data by introducing fully encrypted cellphones.  Those moves prompted the F.B.I.'s director, James B. Comey, in a speech two weeks ago, to remark that the ""post-Snowden pendulum"" had ""gone too far.""  But Admiral Rogers took a different tack in his speech on Monday, before an audience of students and faculty at Stanford, saying ""a fundamentally strong Internet is in the best interest of the U.S.""  Increasingly encrypted products and services are ""a challenge,"" Admiral Rogers said. ""And we'll deal with it."" He added that the agency had changed its approach to so-called zero-day vulnerabilities, which are undiscovered software bugs that could be exploited for espionage. In the past, the N.S.A. had actively searched for and bought zero-day bugs from defense contractors as well as hackers.  On Monday, Admiral Rogers said that when the agency discovered software bugs and vulnerabilities, ""the default setting is if we become aware of a vulnerability, we share it.""  But he said there would be exceptions.  ""There are some instances where we are not going to do that,"" he said, declining to clarify what circumstances would warrant disclosure.  Admiral Rogers was making his second visit to Silicon Valley since he joined the N.S.A. last April. He said he would return every six months, both to engage technology executives in a dialogue about ""what the N.S.A. is and what it is not"" and also because the agency now competes with technology companies and start-ups for the same employees.  The days when the Defense Department drove technical innovation, he said, ""are way behind us."" He also pushed on Monday for better information-sharing between the intelligence community and private technology companies. Legislation that would set up a formal information-sharing system has stalled in Congress, facing objections from the private sector. ""It is unrealistic to expect the private sector to withstand the actions of nation-states,"" Admiral Rogers said. ""I think it is also unrealistic to expect the government to deal with this all by itself. How do we create the partnerships that allow us to work together as a team."" A partnership with Silicon Valley corporations is likely to be an uphill battle. At a recent Apple event, Timothy D. Cook, the company's chief executive, said that the company's priority was to protect consumer privacy and that it would not loosen security or encryption for intelligence-gathering efforts.  ""There's been some comments from some law enforcement types that said, 'Hey, this is not good, we don't have the flexibility we had before,' "" Mr. Cook said. ""If law enforcement wants something they should go to the user and get it. It's not for me to do that."" "
Report Details a Bug Exploited by Hackers,"LONDON -- Russian hackers used a bug in Microsoft Windows to spy on several Western governments, NATO and the Ukrainian government, according to a report released Tuesday by iSight Partners, a computer security firm in Dallas.  The targets also included European energy and telecommunications companies and an undisclosed academic organization in the United States, the Internet security report said. While it is unclear what type of information may have been retrieved, iSight said that the targets of the attacks were often linked to the standoff in Ukraine between Russia and the West. That included the NATO summit meeting in Wales in early September at which the Russian hackers targeted the Ukrainian government and at least one American organization, the report said. The illegal activities started as early as 2009 and used a variety of techniques to gain access to confidential information. But iSight said that it was only in the late summer that the Russian hackers started using what experts refer to as a zero-day attack -- the exploitation of a previously unknown vulnerability -- on Windows. The bug affected versions from Windows Vista to the company's latest software, Windows 8.1, though Microsoft is expected to release an update on Tuesday to resolve the potential vulnerability. Despite efforts to thwart the Russian hackers' attacks, iSight said using the Microsoft bug and other illegal tactics almost certainly allowed the hackers to gain some access to their targets. ''The use of this zero-day vulnerability virtually guarantees that all of those entities targeted fell victim to some degree,'' the company said. While the vulnerability affected many versions of Windows, iSight said the Russian hackers appeared to be the only group to use the bug. The company added, however, that other companies and organizations might also have been attacked. Representatives for Microsoft and the Russian government were not immediately available for comment. The discovery of the hacking is the latest in a series of worldwide attacks that have affected individuals, government agencies and companies. Many of these attacks have originated in Russia and other Eastern European countries, though the purpose of the hackers' efforts has often varied. Last year, for example, Eastern European hackers gained access to the data of up to 110 million customers of the retailer Target. In August, security researchers discovered that a separate Russian crime ring had amassed a huge collection of stolen online information, including roughly 1.2 billion user names and passwords and more than 500 million email addresses. And this month, JPMorgan Chase also revealed that another cyberattack, which experts believe originated in Russia, had compromised the banking accounts of roughly 76 million households and seven million small businesses. ISight said it had called the most recent Russian hackers the Sandworm team because they used encoded references to the science fiction series ''Dune'' in their attacks. ISight said the group often used so-called spear-phishing techniques in its attacks against Western government and commercial targets. That involved sending emails to prospective targets with documents attached that, when opened, could allow the attacker to gain control of the computer. Many of the emails were specifically related to the Ukrainian conflict and to wider issues linked to Russia, the company said. "
Hagel Seeks Peace Pact for the Digital Realm,"WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, in his first lengthy comments on the Pentagon's growing mission in computer-network warfare, said Friday that the United States does not seek to ''militarize'' cyberspace, and pledged that the Defense Department would show restraint in its global operations -- if other nations do the same.  In the same speech, though, Mr. Hagel said the Pentagon planned to more than triple its staff devoted to the area in the next few years, and spoke of increasing the country's defenses against computer-network attacks. Cybersecurity, he said, is falling behind the country's reliance on cyberspace, as the rise of destructive malware has ushered in a ''new reality'' of steady, continuing and aggressive attacks on private and government computer networks. Mr. Hagel's dual messages of attack and restraint, to commemorate the retirement of Gen. Keith B. Alexander, who has overseen both the military's Cyber Command and the intelligence community's National Security Agency, are bound to be a tough sell to foreign leaders, given debate over widespread N.S.A. surveillance and recent news reports that the agency penetrated a Chinese telecommunications giant it saw as a security threat. The issue will doubtless come up when Mr. Hagel heads to Beijing in a week to discuss a range of military and security issues with his Chinese counterparts. ''Our government is promoting the very qualities of the Internet -- integrity, reliability and openness -- that have made it a catalyst for freedom and prosperity in the United States and around the world,'' Mr. Hagel said. Before Mr. Hagel's speech, a senior Pentagon official said the defense secretary was seeking to de-escalate tension with Beijing in advance of his trip. The official, speaking on standard governmental rules of anonymity to discuss the thinking behind a cabinet secretary's remarks, said that the United States was seeking to be ''more transparent'' about its goals and missions in cyberspace. The New York Times and Der Spiegel reported this week that even as American officials were expressing fears that Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, would create so-called back doors in its equipment that could allow the Chinese military or Beijing-based hackers to steal corporate and government secrets, the N.S.A. was creating its own back doors directly into Huawei's networks. According to N.S.A. documents provided by the former contractor Edward J. Snowden, the agency pried its way into the servers in Huawei's sealed headquarters in Shenzhen. Mr. Hagel did not address Huawei in his speech, but he said the United States would ''maintain an approach of restraint to any cyberoperations outside of U.S. government networks.'' He added that ''we are urging other nations to do the same.'' Defense Department officials said they are recruiting talent to work on cybersecurity both within and outside the Pentagon. By 2016, Mr. Hagel said, the Defense Department should have 6,000 professionals in the area. By the end of this year, Defense Department officials expect to have 1,800. President Obama has nominated Vice Adm. Michael S. Rogers to replace General Alexander at both the N.S.A. and Cyber Command. "
How a Times Cyber-Security Reporter Protects Her Data. And What You Can Do to Protect Yours.," Nicole Perlroth covers cyber security and privacy. Last week she wrote on Home Depot's confirmation that hackers had broken into its in-store payments systems in what could be the largest-known breach of a retail company's computer network. She shares her thoughts on security and personal data with Times Insiders.   Q.   You've written about Russian hackers, financial malware, attacks on J.P. Morgan's bank-server security and on Middle East petrochemical plants. Does your reporting make you paranoid about your own data?  A.  Of course. I wrote about a cyberattack at the Chamber of Commerce a few years back. Six months after security teams and the FBI cleaned up the Chamber's systems, a printer in their Washington offices was still communicating with an I.P. address in China. So was the thermometer in one of the Chamber's corporate apartments. There is a lot to be paranoid about.  I try to do as much as I can to protect my data, but so much depends on the security practices of the companies to which we have willingly handed our data and to those that took it without our knowledge.  At some point, I just sort of threw my hands up. If Chinese or Russian hackers want to read my texts with my fiance, they're going to do so. I'm just irritated that it's slowing my Internet connection.  Q.  Before throwing up your hands, what do you do to safeguard your personal data?   A.  I don't hand my email address or birth date to retailers. I use my credit card to make purchases and try to abstain from using my debit card unless I'm at a bank. I do not use self-checkout systems at merchants, because those are often the first place hackers will scan.  For my own personal data, I use long, complex passwords. I also use two different web browsers - one for browsing to my email and bank account, the other for e-commerce and general web browsing.  I switch on two-factor authentication wherever I can. I try not to say anything in an email or text message that I wouldn't mind a stranger reading. I am very careful about the ways in which I communicate with my sources. I use Wickr, a mobile app that encrypts and self-destructs messages. I also use Silent Circle, which allows me to place encrypted phone calls. There are some sources I will only meet in person, which is inconvenient to say the least, but that is the world we now live in.   Q.  Have you changed your computer security much since you started writing about hackers and computer security breaches?   A.  I get a lot of strange looks because I put masking tape over the webcam on my computer, but the last thing I need is a hacker watching me while I work.  Q.  What's the biggest threat hackers pose to ordinary people and their personal data?   A.  If somebody steals your credit card number, your bank will reimburse any fraudulent charges. To me, the bigger threat is that someone will use my stolen data for identity theft and tank my credit score. Hackers are actively selling medical records on the black market. My worst fear is that someone would use my medical identity and pollute my lifetime medical records.   Q.  What can readers/all of us do to protect ourselves?  Be vigilant. Don't give your personal data away willy-nilly. Use strong passwords. And by strong, I mean long and not a word from the dictionary. Don't use the same password across multiple accounts. If one gets compromised, they all get compromised. Turn on two-factor authentication. Treat your email and text messages as if these are public conversations. Use your credit card when you can instead of your debit card. Ask companies why they need your data when they ask for it.  Q.  And what is the worst case hacking scenario?   A.  A cyber attack with physical consequences, such as an attack on a water shed or petrochemical company that would poison our water systems or cause an explosion. The United States and Israel proved that kind of attack is possible when they took out the uranium supply at an Iranian facility with a computer virus. The good news is that those who have the abilities to pull off such an attack are sufficiently deterred from doing so.   Q.  Yikes. How imminent or likely is that?   A.  I don't want to speculate because there are plenty of fear mongers out there and I don't want to do their bidding. But the reality is that cyber attacks will play a very prominent role in any real world conflict going forward.  Q.  What's the next likely development on the cyber security beat - what are you watching for?   A.  Retail breaches will dominant my beat for some time. The Secret Service estimates that 1,000 United States companies have been hit with the same attack that compromised Target and Home Depot. Many of them don't even know they've been breached. But many are hushing it up. Let's just say I have my work cut out for me. "
Cybersecurity Breaches Raise Questions," On Tuesday, Nicole Perlroth reported on two separate sets of cybersecurity breaches. At Sony Pictures Entertainment, hackers defaced websites, leaked films and disclosed the pre-bonus salaries of senior Sony executives. They sabotaged data as well. Separately, Ms. Perloth covered a report about a series of Iranian attacks on more than 50 companies around the world.    Here Ms. Perlroth, The Times's cybersecurity reporter, charts out the questions she will be asking in the days ahead.  The attacks at Sony are what United States officials have long feared - an attack designed to sabotage data. We saw this kind of attack play out two years ago at Saudi Aramco, when Iranian hackers destroyed data on 30,000 Aramco computers and replaced it with an image of a burning American flag.  Then, last year, major broadcasters and banks in South Korea were infected with malware that made their machines unusable. Many suspect these attacks were the work of North Korea, but we were never able to lock that theory down. For a long time, government officials have warned such an attack would hit the United States. With the attack at Sony, it appears that it has.  I'll continue to investigate how serious the damage was at Sony and whether other companies were hit. But I'm also curious to know whether copycats are going to start probing networks and sabotaging data at other American companies or within the government.  I'm also interested in the increased collaboration between Iran and North Korea. We don't know whether it was North Korea that hit Sony. But the attack has hallmarks of last year's attack in South Korea, which many believe was the work of its northern neighbor. I am also not sure that the attack on Sony and the attacks by Iran on a number of companies around the globe are as unrelated as people think.  North Korea and Iran signed an agreement, in September 2012, to cooperate on scientific and information-technology-security issues. The report Tuesday on Iranian attacks noted that Iranian hackers had zeroed in on a number of critical computer systems in South Korea. Could this be part of an effort to bolster North Korea and Iran's burgeoning partnership in cyberspace?  I would like to know what the two countries' cyberrelationship looks like, and whether it played any role in Iran's latest attacks.  "
Bitcoin Foundation Bolsters Its Ranks,"The Bitcoin Foundation is adding to its ranks as regulators around the world struggle with how to oversee the evolving world of digital currency. The foundation announced on Tuesday that it had hired Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at the libertarian research group the Cato Institute, as global policy counsel. Mr. Harper will act as a liaison to governments around the world for the foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group that has previously met with federal regulators in an effort to push for a broader understanding and adoption of Bitcoin.   ""Like many in the Bitcoin community, he is passionate about doing his part in achieving Bitcoin's social and economic potential,"" a spokeswoman for the foundation, Jinyoung Lee Englund, said in an email. Mr. Harper's appointment with the foundation is effective immediately. He will remain at Cato in the reduced role of a senior fellow.  In addition to Mr. Harper, the foundation announced it had hired Amy Weiss as a consultant, bringing the group's total number of full-time employees to eight, all of whom are paid in Bitcoin. Ms. Weiss has previously served as a White House deputy press secretary under Bill Clinton and as vice president of public affairs for the United Nations Foundation.  The hirings come at a turning point in the world of computer-driven virtual currency, as regulators weigh how to manage a rapidly evolving marketplace with no central regulator or authority. The announcements came the same day as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulator, issued an investor alert warning of Bitcoin's risks. ""As with so many other 'hot' or new trends, fraudsters may see the latest digital currency trend as a chance to steal your money through old-fashioned fraud,"" the warning stated.  Last month, the Bitcoin community was rattled by the collapse of Mt. Gox, which was at one point the largest online Bitcoin exchange.  Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States on Sunday after announcing that nearly 750,000 of its customers' Bitcoins, worth close to $500 million, had gone missing. The company has also filed for bankruptcy in Japan.  The bankruptcy brought even more scrutiny to a fledgling currency that already has some regulators worried about its potential use in drug trafficking and other illegal activities. Federal prosecutors are currently investigating Silk Road, the now-defunct online marketplace accused of aiding money laundering and other illicit transactions. Authorities in other countries are also struggling with just how to oversee Bitcoin. Russia, for example, has banned the currency altogether, while other countries, including Germany, have generally favored the new technology.  Mr. Harper previously served as a member of the Department of Homeland Security's Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee. He was already a member of the Bitcoin Foundation before his appointment as global policy counsel, and he has made it clear that he favors integrating Bitcoin into existing regulation rather than creating new rules specific to virtual currency. ""Technology-specific regulation is generally eschewed by most people,"" Mr. Harper said on Tuesday. ""So the idea that Bitcoin should be specifically regulated doesn't make a lot of sense.""  "
Experts Question U.S. Account of Sony Hacking,"A number of private security researchers are increasingly voicing doubts that the hack of Sony's computer systems was the work of North Korea. President Obama and the F.B.I. last week accused North Korea of targeting Sony and pledged a ''proportional response'' just hours before North Korea's Internet went dark without explanation. But security researchers remain skeptical, with some even likening the government's claims to those of the Bush administration in the build-up to the Iraq war. Fueling their suspicions is the fact that the government based its findings, in large part, on evidence that it will not release, citing the ''need to protect sensitive sources and methods.'' The government has never publicly acknowledged doing so, but the National Security Agency has begun a major effort to penetrate North Korean computer networks. Because attributing the source of a cyberattack is so difficult, the government has been reluctant to do so except in the rarest of circumstances. So the decision to have President Obama charge that North Korea was behind the Sony hack suggested there is some form of classified evidence that is more conclusive than the indicators that the F.B.I. made public on Friday. ''It's not a move we made lightly,'' one senior administration official said after Mr. Obama spoke.  Still, security researchers say they need more proof. ''Essentially, we are being left in a position where we are expected to just take agency promises at face value,'' Marc Rogers, a security researcher at CloudFlare, the cloud security company, wrote in a post Wednesday. ''In the current climate, that is a big ask.'' Mr. Rogers, who doubles as the director of security operations for DefCon, an annual hacker convention, and others like Bruce Schneier, a prominent cryptographer and blogger, have been mining the meager evidence that has been publicly circulated, and argue that it is hardly conclusive. For one, skeptics note that the few malware samples they have studied indicate the hackers routed their attack through computers all over the world. One of those computers, in Bolivia, had been used by the same group to hack targets in South Korea. But that computer, as well as others in Poland, Italy, Thailand, Singapore, Cyprus and the United States, were all freely available to anyone to use, which opens the list of suspects to anyone with an Internet connection and basic hacking skills. For another, Sony's attackers constructed their malware on computers configured with Korean language settings, but skeptics note that those settings could have been reset to deflect blame. They also note the attackers used commercial software wiping tools that could have been purchased by anyone. They also point out that whoever attacked Sony had a keen understanding of its computer systems -- the names of company servers and passwords were all hard-coded into the malware -- suggesting the hackers were inside Sony before they launched their attack. Or it could even have been an inside job. And then there's the motive. Government officials claim the Sony attacks were retaliation for ''The Interview,'' a feature film about two bumbling journalists hired by the C.I.A. to assassinate North Korea's leader. In a letter last June, North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations called the film ''an act of war.'' But naysayers point out that, as far as they can tell, Sony's attackers did not mention the film as motivation until that theory percolated in the media. The simpler explanation is that it was an angry ''insider,'' Mr. Rogers wrote. ''Combine that with the details of several layoffs that Sony was planning, and you don't have to stretch the imagination too far to consider that a disgruntled Sony employee might be at the heart of it all.'' Some of these claims contradict one another. Why, some question would the attackers use Korean language settings simply to throw off forensics specialists, but mention the film only after the media had? On Wednesday, one alternate theory emerged. Computational linguists at Taia Global, a cybersecurity consultancy, performed a linguistic analysis of the hackers' online messages -- which were all written in imperfect English -- and concluded that based on translation errors and phrasing, the attackers are more likely to be Russian speakers than Korean speakers. Such linguistic analysis is hardly foolproof. But the practice, known as stylometry, has been used to contest the authors behind some of history's most disputed documents, from Shakespearean sonnets to the Federalist Papers. Shlomo Argamon, Taia's Global's chief scientist, said in an interview Wednesday that the research was not a quantitative, computer analysis. Mr. Argamon said he and a team of linguists had mined hackers' messages for phrases that are not normally used in English and found 20 in total. Korean, Mandarin, Russian and German linguists then conducted literal word-for-word translations of those phrases in each language. Of the 20, 15 appeared to be literal Russian translations, nine were Korean and none matched Mandarin or German phrases. Mr. Argamon's team performed a second test of cases where hackers used incorrect English grammar. They asked the same linguists if five of those constructions were valid in their own language. Three of the constructions were consistent with Russian; only one was a valid Korean construction. ''Korea is still a possibility, but it's much less likely than Russia,'' Mr. Argamon said of his findings. Even so, Taia Global's sample size is small. Similar computerized attempts to identify authorship, such as JStylo, a computerized software tool, requires 6,500 words of available writing samples per suspect to make an accurate finding. In this case, hackers left less than 2,000 words between their emails and online posts. It is also worth noting that other private security researchers say their own research backs up the government's claims. CrowdStrike, a California security firm that has been tracking the same group that attacked Sony since 2006, believes they are located in North Korea and have been hacking targets in South Korea for years. But without more proof, skeptics are unlikely to simply demur to F.B.I. claims. ''In the post-Watergate post-Snowden world, the USG can no longer simply say 'trust us','' Paul Rosenzweig, the Department of Homeland Security's former deputy assistant secretary for policy, wrote on the Lawfare blog Wednesday. ''Not with the U.S. public and not with other countries. Though the skepticism may not be warranted, it is real.'' Mr. Rosenzweig argued that the government should release more persuasive evidence. ''Otherwise it should stand silent and act (or not) as it sees fit without trying to justify its actions. That silence will come at a significant cost, of course -- in even greater skepticism. But if the judgment is to disclose, then it must be more fulsome, with all the attendant costs of that as well.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Q & A: Adam Segal on China, Cyberspies and the Moral High Ground","This week, the United States took its most aggressive step yet in trying to curb what it calls Chinese state-sponsored hacking attacks aimed at stealing trade secrets from American corporations. The Justice Department on Monday announced an indictment against five members of the People's Liberation Army accused of corporate cyberespionage. United States officials say the five men belong to Unit 61398, which operates out of an office tower on the outskirts of Shanghai.  The unit, known within the cybersecurity industry as the Comment Crew or the Shanghai Group, was first publicly named in a report on Chinese cyberespionage released in February 2013 by Mandiant, an American computer security firm. (The New York Times hired Mandiant to investigate a breach of its internal network in autumn 2012, and the attack was traced to a group inside China, but not the Comment Crew.)  In its announcement, the Justice Department released photographs of the five hacking suspects, with at least two in military uniforms. But the issue of cyberespionage has become a much murkier issue for the United States following disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor. China has denounced the indictment and said it is itself the victim of cyberespionage by the United States. The Obama administration continues to insist there is a distinction between spying for national security purposes and spying to steal corporate secrets that would benefit business interests. In an interview, Adam Segal, an expert on China and cybersecurity at the Council on Foreign Relations, discussed the clash over cyberspying:  Q.    Why did the Obama administration move forward at this time with the indictment of these five members of the People's Liberation Army? How long have Justice Department officials and others in the administration been discussing this kind of action?   A.  The timing seems to be the result of frustration with diplomacy. The Obama administration has raised the issue for many years with Beijing and, in the spring of 2013, waged a ""naming and shaming"" campaign against China-based cyberattacks, which culminated with President Obama raising the issue with President Xi Jinping at the Sunnylands summit. That diplomatic effort stalled, and the indictment can be seen as a signal that the U.S. government still takes the issue seriously. But even before the diplomatic process had run its course, the government was considering methods of imposing costs on Chinese hackers. In late 2012, the Justice Department announced that it planned to indict state-sponsored hackers; set up a special unit, National Security Cyber Specialist network; and asked the F.B.I. to begin looking for cases that the Justice Department could bring to court.  Q.   Has any progress been made in the dialogue between the United States and China on cyberespionage? How did the Snowden revelations affect that dialogue?   A.  On cyberespionage, the two sides keep speaking past each other, swapping accusations and stressing their own victimhood. But it is unlikely that either side ever thought the U.S.-China cyber working group would make progress on espionage, which is not usually subject to international norms. There was some hope, however, that the two sides could begin to come to some understandings about the rules of the road for cyberconflict. What type of cyberattacks should be considered a use of force or armed attack? Are there targets, like hospitals or the financial system, which should be off limits? The Snowden revelations certainly increased the mistrust on the Chinese side, reinforcing the need for the dialogue. The Chinese have suspended the dialogue in response to the indictment. Both sides have an interest in their resuming soon.  Q.   Do you think this new step in a name-and-shame strategy by the United States will have any practical impact? Will it have any effect in a more abstract sense?   A.  The indictments have very little practical impact in the short term, except for the possibility of retaliation from Beijing. They are symbolic but in an important way for three different audiences. They are a clear escalation with Beijing, and so a marker of the importance of the issue to the United States government. They are an effort to encourage other countries, particularly in Europe, to push back against China-based hacking. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder tied the indictments to the larger trade system when he argued that ""success in the global marketplace should be based solely on a company's ability to innovate and compete, not on a sponsor government's ability to spy and steal business secrets."" And they were a response to complaints from American companies that Washington had to do something about the theft of intellectual property, trade secrets and business strategies.  Q.   There are many people, and not just in China, pointing to the hypocrisy of this latest move by the United States, given the assertions made by Snowden. Does the United States have the standing to take the moral high ground on this issue?   A.  The United States, along with its friends and allies, is right to question China about cyberespionage directed at private companies. It is a threat to the competitiveness of companies and to national economies. That said, other countries, including U.S. friends and allies, are right to question the United States government about what type of surveillance it is conducting in cyberspace and whether the pursuit of American national security interests risks not only weakening important bilateral relationships, say with Germany and Brazil, but also undermining the global, open, secure and resilient Internet. They are two interconnected but distinct concerns.  Q.   Can the Obama administration's fine parsing of national security versus economic cyberespionage - the former being justified and deemed legal and the latter not - be applied in the real world? Will other nations accept this? How can this distinction be applied to countries with economic models that are very different from that of the United States?  A.  It is an uphill slog, and the United States has not gotten much traction in the real world. The distinction between cyberespionage for security or national economic interest versus cybertheft for the benefit of specific companies is lost, not credible or not meaningful to many, if not most, other countries. Instead of hoping for widespread adoption of the norm, the United States may do better through unilateral action, like the indictments, or embedding restrictions on companies that benefit from cybertheft in future trade agreements.  Q.   Was there a change to the level of Chinese state-sponsored hacking that targeted foreign companies after the release of the Mandiant report in early 2013? What are the current levels of Chinese state-sponsored hacking compared to the levels that existed before the Mandiant report was released?   A.  It appears that the specific group mentioned in the Mandiant report, APT1, also known as Unit 61398 of the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department's 3rd Department, ceased activity after the report, and then returned a few months later to its historical levels of attacks. In addition, much of the slack was taken up by other hacking groups. A group called APT12 by Mandiant increased its attacks. Over all, the levels of attacks are the same.  Q.   How much of economic cyberespionage from China is being done by the People's Liberation Army as opposed to that being done by hackers employed by companies? Why do you think the United States decided to focus on P.L.A. hackers in the Justice Department indictments?   A.  There is no open-source estimate of how much of the hacking is state-based versus individual or freelance hackers, but the focus on P.L.A. hackers may reflect their importance and efficacy in economic cyberespionage. It is also probably rooted in the belief that it should be easier to get the Chinese leadership to rein in P.L.A. hackers than those employed by hundreds of companies.  Q.   What do we know about the relationship between P.L.A. hackers and Chinese state-owned enterprises or other Chinese companies? Is cyberespionage a work-for-hire service offered by the P.L.A.? Is it a profit center for the P.L.A.?  A.  There are many types of relationships. Some P.L.A. hackers offer their services under contract to state-owned enterprises. For some critical technologies, it is possible that P.L.A. hackers are tasked with attacks on specific foreign companies. Some freelance hackers offer their wares to the P.L.A. or to state-owned enterprises - they may enter into longer-term arrangements. A number of high-profile hackers have become ""white hats,"" setting up companies and offering their cybersecurity expertise to the P.L.A. and to state-owned companies.  Q.   What do we know about the numbers and abilities of hackers or cybersecurity experts in the P.L.A.?   A.  Project 2049 identifies the General Staff Department's 3rd Department as ""a vast bureaucracy responsible for monitoring foreign communications, assuring the security of P.L.A.computer and communications networks, and conducting cybersurveillance on priority targets around the world."" It includes units that focus on Korea and Japan, Russia, Europe and the rest of the world. In public writings, Chinese analysts are worried about the state of cybersecurity in the P.L.A. They note defensive weaknesses, especially the dependence on American technology. They decry the lack of offensive units, and they are uneasy about the budget and capabilities of U.S. Cyber Command. Western cybersecurity experts tend to rank Chinese hackers below the Russians. China brings numbers to the problem. The hackers go after more targets, and spend more time in the networks. The Russians bring more technological skill and are more surgical.                       "
Data Broker Is Charged With Selling Consumers' Financial Details to Fraudsters,"Who should be liable when corporations misuse personal details about consumers for their own gain: the company that exploited the data or the middleman that sold consumers' information to the exploiter? If federal regulators have their way, the liability will fall on both parties. This week, the Federal Trade Commission filed a law suit alleging that LeapLab, a data broker in Nevada, sold intimate details about several hundred thousand people, including their Social Security numbers and bank account numbers, to marketers and other companies that had no legitimate need for that information.   One of the data purchasers, Ideal Financial Solutions of Las Vegas, reportedly used the records it bought to make unauthorized withdrawals from consumers' bank accounts, according to a separate federal law suit.  The complaints are part of a multi-year government crackdown on fraudulent debt collection and other scams that target people in financial distress. But the case against LeapLab indicates that federal regulators are now widening their investigation to includethe middlemen who traffic in the kind of sensitive consumer details that can make consumers vulnerable to financial scams. ""We have been targeting the actual fraudsters for years. Now we are really trying to move behind the scenes and target the data brokers,"" Jessica Rich, the director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a phone interview Tuesday. ""The message is that selling consumers' highly sensitive data to third parties, with either the knowledge or a strong suspicion that they have no legitimate need for it, violates the law."" The complaint charged that LeapLab obtained files on hundreds of thousands of consumers who were applying for payday loans from lead generators. These are companies that set up consumer-friendly sites, typically asking users to provide their contact information and specific financial details, with the goal of marketing access to potential customers to businesses like payday lenders and insurers.  According to the complaint, LeapLab bought payday loan applications containing consumers' names, addresses, phone numbers, employer name, Social Security numbers, bank account numbers and bank routing numbers. But federal regulators say that the company sold only about 5 percent of those records to online lenders, who paid between $10 to $150 to acquire each loan application. The remaining records were sold, without consumers' knowledge or consent, for about 50 cents each to non-lenders including ""fraudsters, spammers and telemarketers,"" the complaint said. ""They sold information that could only be used for illegitimate purposes and that is what happened,"" said James A. Kohm, associate director of the division of enforcement in the F.T.C.'s consumer protection bureau. Federal regulators said that one company, Ideal Financial Solutions, bought at least 2.2 million consumer dossiers from LeapLab and other information middlemen.  The company used the information to make about $43 million in unauthorized bank withdrawals or charges without providing any product or services to consumers in exchange for the money, Mr. Kohm said. About $4.2 million of that came from consumers whose records the company obtained from LeapLab, he said. Last year, a federal court halted the operations of Ideal Financial Solutions, freezing the company's assets. The F.T.C. has asked the court for a summary judgment against the company. A phone number for the company, listed on regulatory filings, was disconnected. The LeapLab website is no longer operating and company executives could not immediately be reached for comment. ""The case squarely says what the liability is for data brokers that sell consumers' sensitive information to fraudsters,"" Ms. Rich of the F.T.C. said. "
Russian Arrested in Guam on Charges Tied to Hacking of U.S. Retail Systems,"A Russian man accused of being one of the world's most prolific traffickers of stolen financial information was arrested in Guam on Saturday, according to the Secret Service. Roman Valerevich Seleznev was arrested on charges that he hacked into cash register systems at retailers throughout the United States from 2009 to 2011. The Secret Service would not say whether he was tied to the recent attacks that affected the in-store cash register systems at Target, Neiman Marcus, Michaels and other retailers last year. The arrest of Mr. Seleznev provides a lens onto the shadowy world of Russian hackers, the often sophisticated programmers who seem to operate with impunity. As long ago as March 2011, the United States attorney's office in Washington State identified Mr. Seleznev, a Russian citizen, in a sealed indictment as ''Track2,'' an underground alias that is an apparent reference to the data that can be pulled off the magnetic strips of credit and debit cards.  That data includes enough basic information -- like account numbers and expiration dates -- to make fraudulent purchases. The indictment accuses Mr. Seleznev of hacking into the cash register systems of businesses across the United States and of operating computer servers and international online forums in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere where such stolen data is traded in the digital underground. It was not yet clear how the Secret Service arrested Mr. Seleznev, and the United States attorney's office in Washington State declined to elaborate. In a statement, the Secret Service said Mr. Seleznev's charges included five counts of bank fraud, eight counts of intentionally causing damage to a protected computer, eight counts of obtaining information from a protected computer, one count of possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices, two counts of trafficking unauthorized access devices, and five counts of aggravated identity theft. According to the indictment, which was unsealed on Monday, Mr. Seleznev is accused of scanning devices for weaknesses and inserting so-called malware that was capable of stealing credit card information. He is accused of stealing 32,000 credit card numbers from computers at Broadway Grill, in Seattle, from December 2009 to October 2010. The restaurant did not discover the thefts until late October 2010. Mr. Seleznev is also accused of similar heists at four other Washington State restaurants and a number of other American businesses, including Schlotzsky's Deli in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; Active Network in Frostburg, Md.; Day's Jewelers in Maine; Latitude Bar and Grill in Manhattan; and the Phoenix Zoo. In addition, Mr. Seleznev is also accused of stealing more than 200,000 credit card numbers from November 2010 to February 2011 and of selling 140,000 credit card numbers on underground sites with names like bulba.cc and Track2.name, generating profits of more than $2 million. ''This scheme involved multiple network intrusions and data thefts for illicit financial gain,'' Julia Pierson, director of the Secret Service, said in a statement. ''The adverse impact this individual and other transnational organized criminal groups have on our nation's financial infrastructure is significant and should not be underestimated.'' Mr. Seleznev appeared at a court in Guam on Monday. He will be held in custody there until his next hearing in two weeks. He faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of just the bank fraud. The other charges also carry significant sentences. The case remains under investigation by the United States Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force in Seattle and is being prosecuted by the United States attorney's office for the Western District of Washington. According to one government official, who declined to be identified because of the current investigation, Mr. Seleznev was also among the members of a transnational criminal organization whose members bought and sold personal and financial information through online carding forums, such as the Russian underground website carder.su. In 2012, 19 members of that group were arrested, but Mr. Seleznev remained at large. He still faces a separate indictment in the District of Nevada on charges of racketeering as well as two counts of possession of 15 or more counterfeit and unauthorized access devices. Todd Greenberg, an assistant United States attorney, would not comment on the means by which Mr. Seleznev, a Russian national, was detained in Guam. However, arrests in Russia over computer crimes are rare, even when hackers living in Russia have been outed by outside groups like the Spamhaus Project, a spam-prevention service based in Europe. According to Spamhaus, Russia is the world's third-biggest source of Internet spam, after the United States and China. Just last week, American security researchers accused the Russian government of systematically hacking into oil and gas companies in the United States and other Western nations. The United States has treated computer security as a law enforcement matter. But Russia has pushed for an international treaty that would regulate the use of online weapons by military or espionage agencies. The United States has been hesitant to press for such a treaty -- in large part because its own National Security Agency is behind some of the broadest espionage operations -- but it has continued to press for closer law enforcement cooperation on cybercrime. "
UPS Investigating Possible Security Breach,"UPS said on Wednesday that it was investigating a security breach that may have led to the theft of customer credit and debit data at 51 UPS locations in the United States. Chelsea Lee, a UPS spokeswoman, said the company began investigating its systems for indications of a security breach on July 31, the day The New York Times reported that the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service would be issuing a bulletin warning retailers that hackers had been scanning networks for remote access capabilities, then installing so-called malware that was undetectable by antivirus products. UPS hired an information security firm and discovered that the malware was  on its in-store cash register systems at 51 of its locations in 24 states, roughly 1  percent of UPS's 4,470 franchises throughout the United States.  In a statement, the company said that customers who had used their debit or credit cards at affected locations, which are listed on the UPS website, from  Jan. 20 to Aug. 11, 2014 may have been exposed to the malware, though it said exposure began after March 26 in most cases. UPS said it had eliminated the malware as of Aug. 11. ""I understand this type of incident can be disruptive and cause frustration. I apologize for any anxiety this may have caused our customers. At The UPS Store, the trust of our customers is of utmost importance,"" said Tim Davis, president of The UPS Store, in a statement. ""As soon as we became aware of the potential malware intrusion, we deployed extensive resources to quickly address and eliminate this issue."" The breach at the UPS stores is just the latest in a string of similar cyberattacks on the in-store payment systems at major American corporations, including Target, P.F. Chang's, Neiman Marcus, Michaels, Sally Beauty, and, most recently, the Supervalu and Albertsons grocery stores. In each case, criminals scanned for tools that typically allow employees and vendors to work remotely, then broke into them and used their foothold to install malware on retailers' systems. That malware, in turn, fed customers' payment details back to the hackers' computer servers. The same group of criminals in Eastern Europe is believed to be behind the earlier attacks, according to several people briefed on the results of forensics investigations who were not allowed to speak publicly because of nondisclosure agreements. The entry point for each breach differed, according to one law enforcement official. At Target, it was thought to be a Pennsylvania company that provided heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration services to the retailer. Criminals were able to use the company's login credentials to gain access to Target's systems and eventually to its point-of-sale systems. Studies have found that retailers, in particular, are unprepared for such attacks. A joint study by the Ponemon Institute, an independent security research firm, and DB Networks, a database security firm, found that a majority of computer security experts in the United States believed that their organizations lacked the technology and tools to quickly detect database attacks. Only one-third of those experts said they did the kind of continuous database monitoring needed to identify irregular activity in their databases, and another 22 percent admitted that they did not scan at all. UPS said it would offer one year of free identity protection and credit monitoring services to any customer who had used a credit or debit card at any of its affected store locations.

Ex-Employees Say Home Depot Left Data Vulnerable,"The risks were clear to computer experts inside Home Depot: The home improvement chain, they warned for years, might be easy prey for hackers. But despite alarms as far back as 2008, Home Depot was slow to raise its defenses, according to former employees. On Thursday, the company confirmed what many had feared: The biggest data breach in retailing history had compromised 56 million of its customers' credit cards. The data has popped up on black markets and, by one estimate, could be used to make $3 billion in illegal purchases. Yet long before the attack came to light this month, Home Depot's handling of its computer security was a record of missteps, the former employees said. Interviews with former members of the company's cybersecurity team -- who spoke on the condition they not be named, because they still work in the industry -- suggest the company was slow to respond to early threats and only belatedly took action. In recent years, Home Depot relied on outdated software to protect its network and scanned systems that handled customer information irregularly, those people said. Some members of its security team left as managers dismissed their concerns. Others wondered how Home Depot met industry standards for protecting customer data. One went so far as to warn friends to use cash, rather than credit cards, at the company's stores.  Then, in 2012, Home Depot hired a computer engineer to help oversee security at its 2,200 stores. But this year, as hacks struck other retailers, that engineer was sentenced to four years in prison for deliberately disabling computers at the company where he previously worked. Company officials said the malware used against Home Depot had not been seen before and would have been difficult to detect. Home Depot said on Thursday that it had patched any holes and that it is now safe for customers to shop there. Any card used there between April and Sept. 2 might be vulnerable to being used fraudulently. Stephen Holmes, a Home Depot spokesman, said the company improved its security this year by encrypting register systems and switching to a new smart-chip-based payment standard in all stores. ''Our guiding principle is to do what's right by our customers,'' Mr. Holmes said. The company maintains ''robust security systems,'' he said. Thefts like the one that hit Home Depot -- and an ever-growing list of merchants including Albertsons, UPS, Goodwill Industries and Neiman Marcus -- are the ''new normal,'' according to security experts. These people say retailers have not only been complacent about security, they have also been reluctant to share information with one another. Government officials estimate that as many as 1,000 retailers have been infiltrated by variations of the malware that first struck another big retailer, Target, late last year, and then Home Depot this year. They say many companies do not even know they have been breached. ''This is happening to so many companies now, it is getting hard to keep track,'' said Paul Kocher, the founder and chief scientist at the Cryptography Research division of Rambus. Still, security experts were flabbergasted that Home Depot, one of the world's largest retailers, was caught so flat-footed after the breach at Target, which resulted in the theft of data on more than 40 million cards before the holiday season. After the Target theft, Home Depot's chief executive, Frank Blake, assembled a team to determine how to protect the company's network from a similar attack, said one person briefed on the project. In January, Home Depot brought experts in from Voltage Security, a data security company in California, these people said. By April, the company started introducing in some of its stores enhanced encryption that scrambled payment information the moment a card was swiped. But criminals were already deep in Home Depot's systems. By the time the company learned on Sept. 2 from banks and law enforcement that it had been breached, hackers had been stealing millions of customers' card information, unnoticed for months. The rollout of the company's new encryption was not completed until last week. The retail industry is rushing to respond by forming threat-sharing associations -- Home Depot was a founding member of one such group created earlier this year -- and adopting new encryption and payment system they hope will thwart hackers. But getting those efforts up and running could take months. Several people who have worked in Home Depot's security group in recent years said managers failed to take such threats as seriously as they should have. They said managers relied on outdated Symantec antivirus software from 2007 and did not continuously monitor the network for unusual behavior, such as a strange server talking to its checkout registers. Also, the company performed vulnerability scans irregularly on the dozen or so computer systems inside its stores and often scanned only a small number of stores. Credit card industry security rules require large retailers like Home Depot to conduct such scans at least once a quarter, using technologies approved by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, which develops technical requirements for its members' data security programs. The P.C.I. Council requires that approved, third-party quality security assessors perform routine tests to ensure that merchants are compliant. And yet, two former employees said, while Home Depot data centers in Austin, Tex., and Atlanta were scanned, more than a dozen systems handling customer information were not assessed and were off limits to much of the security staff. A spokeswoman for the P.C.I. Council in Wakefield, Mass., declined to comment on Home Depot specifically. ''Scanning is the easiest part of compliance,'' said Avivah Litan, a cybersecurity analyst at Gartner, a research firm. ''There are a lot of services that do this. They hardly cost any money. And they can be run cheaply from the cloud.'' Home Depot said the industry standards included an exception from scanning store systems that are separated from larger corporate networks, and it said the company had complied with P.C.I. standards since 2009. In 2012, Home Depot hired Ricky Joe Mitchell, a security engineer, who was swiftly promoted under Jeff Mitchell, a senior director of information technology security, to a job in which he oversaw security systems at Home Depot's stores. (The men are not related.) But Ricky Joe Mitchell did not last long at Home Depot. Before joining the company, he was fired by EnerVest Operating, an oil and gas company, and, before he left, he disabled EnerVest's computers for a month. He was sentenced to four years in federal prison in April. Several former Home Depot employees said they were not surprised the company had been hacked. They said that over the years, when they sought new software and training, managers came back with the same response: ''We sell hammers.'' "
Kmart and Dairy Queen Report Data Breach,"In the latest cyberattack on American retailers and restaurants, both Sears and Dairy Queen said their computer systems were compromised in security intrusions involving customers' credit and debit card information.  Kmart, a subsidiary of Sears, said on Thursday that it had been breached and that it was working with law enforcement as well as a forensics team. The company said that it appeared to have been attacked in early September and that malware was present on some of its in-store payment systems. The malware, like the type found at Home Depot recently, was meant to evade antivirus systems. The company did not indicate how many stores were affected or how many credit cards were potentially compromised but said the malware had been removed. Dairy Queen also said on Thursday that its in-store payment systems contained malware. The company said it was working with its franchisees to determine if and when each location was breached and posted a full list, with time frames, on its website. That information suggests hackers made their way into Dairy Queen payment systems in August. Based on early forensics reports, Sears and Dairy Queen said there was no no evidence that personal information, debit card PINs, email addresses or Social Security numbers were obtained in the attack. Only account numbers and expiration dates were taken. Sears and Dairy Queen join nearly a dozen retailers - including Target, Sally Beauty, Neiman Marcus, the United Parcel Service, Michaels, Albertsons, SuperValu, P.F. Chang's and Home Depot - that have had their in-store payment systems compromised with malware over the last year. The Secret Service estimated this summer that 1,000 American merchants were affected by this kind of attack, and that many of them may not even know that they were breached. There have been no arrests to date. In each case, criminals scanned for tools that typically allow employees and vendors to work remotely, then broke into those tools, using their foothold to install malware on retailers' systems. That malware, in turn, fed customers' payment details back to the hackers' computer servers. The same group of criminals in Eastern Europe is believed to be behind the earlier attacks, according to several people with knowledge of the results of forensics investigations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements. The entry point for each breach has differed, according to law enforcement officials. At Target, it was thought to be a Pennsylvania company that provided heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration services to the retailer.

Only one-third of those experts said they did the kind of continuous database monitoring needed to identify irregular activity in their databases, and another 22 percent acknowledged that they did no scanning at all. Sears said it would offer free credit-monitoring services to any customer who had used a credit or debit card at any of its affected store locations. Dairy Queen said it would offer free identity repair services for one year to affected customers.                       "
N.S.A. Choice Is Navy Expert on Cyberwar,"WASHINGTON -- In nominating Vice Adm. Michael S. Rogers as the new director of the National Security Agency on Thursday, President Obama chose a recognized expert in the new art of designing cyberweapons, but someone with no public track record in addressing the kinds of privacy concerns that have put the agency under a harsh spotlight. Mr. Obama's decision to pick a military officer, rather than a civilian versed in civil liberties issues, was made weeks ago, when he rejected his own advisory panel's recommendation that the N.S.A. and the United States Cyber Command have separate leaders. By law the command, the Pentagon's four-year-old cyberwarfare organization, must be headed by a military officer. The result is that Admiral Rogers, now the head of Fleet Cyber Command, the Navy's fast-growing cyberunit, will find himself in the public cross hairs in a way he has never been during a 33-year military career. Starting with his confirmation hearings, expected to begin as soon as next month, the admiral will be pressed on how he would carry out a series of changes that Mr. Obama announced two weeks ago.  But many of the biggest issues, including who will hold the vast database of phone call information and online activity of ordinary Americans that the N.S.A. searches for potential terrorists or nuclear proliferators, remain undecided. And Mr. Obama has deferred decisions on recommendations, also from advisers, that the N.S.A. stop its efforts to weaken commercial encryption and limit its activities to exploiting weaknesses in commonly available software to design cyberweapons. ''Mike's now flying right into the hornet's nest of the stuff the president didn't decide,'' said one senior adviser to the president. ''And it's all going to play out in public.'' It already has: The N.S.A.'s programs have been flayed by civil libertarians, sharply criticized by Silicon Valley companies that say their business is being undercut and denounced by American allies that have been routinely spied on. As it made its widely expected nomination of Admiral Rogers, the administration announced its choice for deputy director of the agency: Rick Ledgett, the N.S.A. official who has been heading the task force assessing the damage done by the revelations of Edward J. Snowden, the former agency contractor. It will clearly be Mr. Ledgett's job to put in place a series of internal changes designed to prevent a repeat of what officials have called the biggest leak of secret data in American history and to deal with its continuing effects. Mr. Ledgett generated headlines weeks ago when, in an interview on the CBS News program ''60 Minutes,'' he said ''it's worth having a conversation'' about giving Mr. Snowden amnesty from prosecution in return for a full accounting of what he took from the N.S.A.'s Hawaii office, and where the remaining, unpublished, data is. The White House immediately rejected the idea of an amnesty, but Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said recently that he would be open to talking about some kind of deal for Mr. Snowden if he returned from Russia. If confirmed, Admiral Rogers will succeed Gen. Keith B. Alexander, who has served as N.S.A. director for nearly nine years and was the first to direct both the civilian spy agency and the Cyber Command. He announced last year that he would retire in March. Since then Admiral Rogers has been considered the most likely successor, because of his experience in code-breaking -- the reason the N.S.A. was created by President Harry S. Truman six decades ago -- and his understanding of the design of America's new arsenal of cyberweapons. Mr. Obama interviewed the admiral for the job last week, though the president left it to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, traveling in Poland on Thursday, to announce the appointment. Mr. Hagel pointed to the challenges the new director will face in a statement, saying, ''Vice Admiral Rogers would bring extraordinary and unique qualifications to this position as the agency continues its vital mission and implements President Obama's reforms.'' He added, ''I am also confident that Admiral Rogers has the wisdom to help balance the demands of security, privacy and liberty in our digital age.'' A statement issued minutes later by the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., made no reference to proposed policy changes at the N.S.A. or the need to conduct the kind of balancing Mr. Hagel referred to -- a reflection, perhaps, of the arguments Mr. Clapper has made internally that many of the proposals undercut the N.S.A.'s ability to protect the country. Admiral Rogers's appointment would clearly be welcomed in the military intelligence community, where he is regarded as a trusted insider. He began his career not in intelligence or electronics, but in traditional surface warfare. He was commissioned via the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps after graduating from Auburn in 1981, and worked in combat naval gunfire support, serving in operations off Grenada, Beirut and El Salvador. But in 1986, after five years in the service, he made a leap that prepared him for the post he is now likely to take up: He began specializing in cryptology, and trained in both electronic and information warfare. A number of assignments to various warships and carrier strike groups followed, taking him to United States and NATO missions in the Balkans and in Afghanistan. Eleven years ago, as the United States was invading Iraq, he joined the military's prestigious Joint Staff, which works for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He specialized in computer network attacks -- what today is called cyberwar -- and subsequently served in a series of senior staff positions that put him in the midst of the issues facing the Joint Chiefs. In 2007, he moved to become director of intelligence for the military's Pacific Command, where China and its tremendous cybersurveillance abilities are a priority. Two years later he became director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and then was named commander of the Fleet Cyber Command, with responsibility for all of the Navy's cyberwarfare efforts. ''I know of no other naval officer as deft as he in synthesizing seemingly disparate bits of information into a cohesive whole,'' said a senior military officer, who would not speak on the record about a pending nomination. ''He connects dots. Some people see the details and can describe them for you. Rogers sees the details and can tell you a story.'' The White House would not specifically say what part of Admiral Rogers's background appealed to Mr. Obama, but his experience in cyberwarfare was undoubtedly a major element, according to people who have dealt with both the president and his nominee. From his first days in office, Mr. Obama was secretly immersed in America's biggest offensive cyberattack mission, a program named Olympic Games that was aimed at Iran's nuclear infrastructure. It is unclear if Admiral Rogers was involved in that operation. But if he is confirmed, the country's growing arsenal of cyberweapons will be under his command. He will also inherit dozens of new cyberteams, based on the military's Special Forces, created by General Alexander to provide cybersecurity for the military and launch cyberattacks. "
A Call for a Highly Encrypted Future,"The future will be encrypted, from the start of a conversation or data transmission to the end of it, if privacy activists and security specialists get their way. But first they have to persuade Google, Facebook and others to give up their business models and embrace an encryption model commonly referred to as end-to-end encryption. On Monday, in a rare live video interview with Edward J. Snowden at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Tex., the former National Security Agency contractor took great pains to endorse end-to-end encryption, as opposed to the encryption methods supported by Google, Facebook, Skype and others, which decrypt a sender's encrypted communication at their data centers before re-encrypting it en route to the recipient.  Mr. Snowden called the companies' encryption methods ""deeply problematic,"" noting that government agencies need only go to a communication provider with a court order, or break into their data centers, to gather a user's information, rather than go to the individual. This year, The New York Times reported that as part of the N.S.A.'s  efforts to circumvent encryption, it was forcing companies to hand over their private encryption keys through court orders or surreptitiously stealing their encryption keys or altering their software or hardware. Using end-to-end encryption, Mr. Snowden noted, which encrypts a message as it travels it from the sender's computer to the recipient's,  forces government agencies to go directly to the individual, rather than through a secret court to their communications provider. ""The result is a more constitutional, more carefully overseen enforcement model,"" Mr. Snowden said. ""If they want to gather each user's communications, they have to go to them specifically."" A new partnership, started by Silent Circle and Lavabit, two privacy-conscious communications providers, called the Dark Mail Alliance is  putting technology companies like Microsoft, Google and Yahoo on the spot by pushing them to put in place the alliance's new end-to-end  encrypted email protocol, but the initiative is off to a slow start. ""The real friction point is that the Yahoos, the Microsofts, the Googles  are all making money mining off free email,"" Mike Janke, one of the founders of the Dark Mail Alliance, said in an interview in November. ""They say they're concerned about our privacy, but this is their opportunity to show they really care."" Four months after the Dark Mail Alliance set up shop, none of the major technology companies have adopted the protocol. Critics say that is because it directly conflicts with their business models, which depend on their ability to use and profit from consumer data. ""Google wants to sit between you and everyone you interact with and provide some kind of added value,"" Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union, said on a panel with Mr. Snowden on Monday. ""They want to be in that connection with you, and that makes it difficult to secure those connections."" Mr. Snowden acknowledged on Monday that end-to-end encryption was not a panacea, given efforts by the N.S.A., its partners and others to hack directly into devices and computers to read communications before they have been scrambled. His talk on Monday came before fresh disclosures from the trove of classified documents he leaked to selected journalists last year. On Wednesday, Glenn Greenwald, reporting for The Intercept, a new journalism project financed by the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, released new classified documents leaked by Mr. Snowden that added further evidence to a New York Times article that detailed efforts by the N.S.A. to hack into computers and devices on a huge scale. The agency was doing this, in part, so it could gain access to communications before encryption. But Mr. Snowden said the agency's efforts to gain a foothold in every device would be difficult. ""They can't pitch exploits in every computer in the world without getting caught,"" he said. ""That is the value of end-to-end encryption, and that is what we need to be thinking about.""  "
A Long Way to Privacy Safeguards,"A new White House report on ''big data'' and privacy includes several recommendations that could help protect the personal information of individuals from warrantless searches and abusive marketing practices. But it still does not do enough to advance the goal President Obama set two years ago for ''clear rules of the road'' on privacy.  In January, Mr. Obama asked John Podesta, a senior adviser, to take on this issue. Like a previous report on privacy published in 2012, the new one does a fine job of laying out some of the benefits and problems associated with the extensive collection and use of personal data by businesses and institutions. (The new report does not cover the activities of intelligence agencies.) Mr. Podesta and his team note that such data can be incredibly useful. To take one example, careful analysis of the voluminous health records collected by hospitals and doctors' offices could help identify the spread of infectious diseases. But the data can also be used by businesses to discriminate against certain groups, like the poor or minorities, by making it easy to avoid selling a product or service to some people or to charge them higher prices. Some of the report's recommendations are right on the mark. It proposes strengthening the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which was passed in 1986, so that law enforcement agencies have to seek the same court approval to gain access to digital content like email that they need for physical information like letters. Currently, law enforcement agencies can obtain email messages from companies like Google without first obtaining a warrant from a court if those messages have been opened or if they have been on a computer server for more than 180 days. The report also recommends extending to foreigners the privacy protections that are afforded to Americans. But other proposals could weaken privacy protections if the administration does not proceed carefully. For example, Mr. Podesta and his team want Congress to pass a law that would require companies to disclose publicly instances when personal information is stolen from their computer systems. But many consumer advocates are rightly worried that a poorly written federal law could pre-empt even stronger disclosure requirements enacted by some states like California. Another recommendation, which is included in a technical analysis that accompanies Mr. Podesta's report, argues that policy makers ''should focus more on the actual uses of big data and less on its collection and analysis.'' The problem with this idea is that consumers have the most control over their information when it is being collected. Once businesses have amassed the information, it can be hard, if not impossible, for individuals to know how it will be used in the future. Most Americans think current laws are insufficient to protect their privacy, according to a Pew Research survey. Mr. Obama has previously said he feels the same way. The Podesta report offers some good recommendations that deserve enactment, even as the administration refines other proposals that still need work. "
American Businesses in China May Feel Retaliatory Sting of Cybershowdown,"BEIJING -- A top Chinese general was in a combative mood as he presided recently over an international security forum at a historic hotel near the Forbidden City. Among the attendees were a retired American admiral and a former American diplomat. The general, Sun Jianguo, delivered his message in an interview with the official military newspaper: The United States was ''the world's biggest cyberthief,'' he said on Tuesday, and had accused China of state-sponsored hacking simply to draw attention away from itself. He invoked a Chinese saying: ''A thief always shouts, 'Stop, thief!' '' Chinese officials are ramping up political and economic pressure on the United States government and large technology companies following the Justice Department's announcement on May 19 of indictments against five members of the Chinese Army on charges of economic cyberespionage. Prominent Chinese officials, agencies and commentators have announced or called for measures that are widely seen as retribution for Washington's latest charges as well as earlier related accusations, raising the specter of a trade war and stoking anxiety among American companies that do business here. At the same time, Chinese technology companies are seizing on the tensions to press state agencies to mandate the use of domestic technology.  Some American executives say the Justice Department's move took them by surprise. They are now nervous over a May 22 announcement by China's State Internet Information Office that the government has established procedures to gauge potential security risks of Internet technology and services. Last week, a Communist Party organization published a scathing attack on Cisco Systems, and a Chinese state-owned technology company trumpeted a campaign to oust IBM from the server market. ''Definitely things have changed in terms of the intensity now,'' said Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA, which advises investors on the Chinese technology sector. ''There's an element of gamesmanship here. It could get ugly.'' The threat of tit-for-tat retaliation was made explicit in an opinion piece posted Wednesday on the English website of Global Times, a state-run newspaper. It said: ''What has happened or what will happen on U.S.-based companies, especially those closely related to information security, is the consequence of China reinforcing its capability and prudence to defend cyber and information security, thanks to the U.S. ratcheting up its espionage against China in recent years.'' On Tuesday, a website of the influential Communist Youth League published the attack on Cisco, which sells high-end routers to government offices and companies throughout China. The editorial, which was carried by major state news organizations, said Cisco ''carries on intimately with the U.S. government and military'' and was ''becoming an important weapon in the U.S. exploiting its power over the Internet.'' Cisco denied the charges. Some Chinese companies are stepping forward as the official backlash against American technology grows. Alibaba Group, one of China's biggest technology firms, announced Wednesday that it hoped its cloud computing products would replace storage services that big American companies had sold to Chinese financial institutions. A Chinese state-owned company, Inspur Group, announced Wednesday on a social networking platform that it planned to ''completely take over'' IBM's main server business in China, and that it had begun a program called ''I2I'' or ''IBM to Inspur'' -- part of an ''irreversible trend of localization.'' Inspur also said that it was open to employing any IBM workers and ''transferring projects'' from rivals, and that it had already hired 80 employees of ''a multinational company.'' An Inspur employee said that company was IBM. Inspur, known in Chinese as Langchao, or Wave, has long been trying to usurp IBM as the dominant player in the server market here. IBM servers are used in state-owned banks. But in March 2013, a nationwide financial institution, Postal Savings Bank of China, began a pilot project to use Inspur servers, according to state news reports at the time. Several provincial banks did the same. Central government agencies, including the People's Bank of China and the Finance Ministry, are reviewing the use of IBM servers and considering whether to expand the use of Chinese-made servers, Bloomberg News reported last week. A spokesman for IBM said the company was not aware of any Chinese government policy recommending that the banking industry not use IBM servers. Analysts say China's drive to promote domestic technology companies over foreign rivals is decades old, but competition with American interests became acute after the House Intelligence Committee said in October 2012 that two of China's largest telecommunications businesses, Huawei Technologies and ZTE Inc., were a national security threat. The companies denied the charges, but the bipartisan report dealt a severe blow to their efforts to win contracts and sell equipment in the United States. (In the China router market, Huawei is the main challenger to Cisco.) Shortly afterward, Chinese officials had serious discussions over establishing a security review process for foreign technology. That was a precursor to the security review procedures announced on May 22. Tensions between the United States and China over information security escalated early last year when the Obama administration and an American cybersecurity firm, Mandiant, said the Chinese government and military were big players in global cyberespionage. American officials say the five Chinese Army men indicted this month are members of Unit 61398, which was the focus of the Mandiant report. The published leaks from Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, in the summer of 2013 undercut the Obama administration's criticisms of China and made Chinese officials even warier of American technology. Chinese news reports talked about the dangers of China being ''infiltrated'' through technology from big American companies nicknamed the ''eight guardian warriors'' -- Cisco, IBM, Google, Qualcomm, Intel, Apple, Oracle and Microsoft. Cisco's sales in China have dropped sharply. And the national procurement office recently barred government offices from using Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system. The emphasis on information security is reflected by the fact that China's president, Xi Jinping, is the head of a new working group on cybersecurity. Attempts to wean China off foreign technology are consistent with longstanding national policy, said Mark Natkin, managing director at Marbridge Consulting, a technology consultancy in Beijing. ''There's this weird foreign idea that everything should be fair,'' he said. ''Ultimately, what China is striving towards is promoting domestic champions and buying locally.'' But Mr. Natkin and other industry analysts say there may be pushback by Chinese companies and institutions against government orders here to get rid of foreign technology if the move is costly or a domestic alternative is inferior. ''There's a cost consideration and product life cycle,'' Mr. Natkin said. ''If they've purchased equipment recently from IBM, for example, there would be reluctance to swap out.'' China Central Television, the state network, posted an online report on Thursday that revealed similar skepticism in the banking industry. ''Everyone uses IBM,'' a senior technology officer at a state bank told the reporter. ''We've been using them for many years. If you say stop using them, isn't that ridiculous?'' The mission of some powerful government agencies is the promotion of Chinese businesses and technology. One such agency is the Ministry of Information and Industry Technology. Last year, for example, the agency said in a paper on cellphone technology that Google had overbearing dominance of the market for smartphone operating systems. ''In China's domestic market, the Android system is in a situation where it has almost absolute advantage,'' the agency said. It said the Chinese companies Huawei, Alibaba and Baidu had put a ''huge amount of money and human talent'' into developing viable alternatives, but that they ''face commercial discrimination from Google all the time.'' That sentiment was articulated recently on a much broader level by Fang Binxing, who is credited with creating the system of Internet blocking in China known as the Great Firewall. In remarks published May 23 on the website of People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, Mr. Fang said each country needed to build its own main servers because ''the Internet is a world that belongs to the U.S.'' ''The ability of Americans to carry out Internet attacks is so strong that other people don't even know how they are beaten,'' Mr. Fang said. ''They don't know when and where they are beaten. They don't have the capabilities to catch the U.S., and thus the U.S. has nothing to fear.'' "
The New Chief of Target Security Is Settling In,"Brad Maiorino sounds like a man unfazed by military hackers in Shanghai or cybercriminals in Eastern Europe. Two months ago, he left his post at General Motors to become Target's first chief information security officer, or CISO, as the retailer was still reeling from a big security breach that cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Some might say he has one of the hardest jobs in corporate America. In an interview, he explains why he does not see it that way. The interview has been edited for brevity. Q: Welcome to one big challenge. A: Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment, but this is every kid's dream job. I'm a geek, and this is an opportunity to play with the latest and greatest toys. There's a cops-and-robbers aspect to it. Right now, we have an opportunity to define what a CISO is, who we should report to, and it's an exciting time to be in the role. From a security standpoint, Target was always very involved in the security community. You could tell they took it very seriously. Pre-breach, Target was not on my radar professionally but after the breach, Target was front and center. All CISOs and board directors were asking, ''What happened at Target? And what are we doing to make sure that doesn't happen to us?'' As I started studying what happened at Target, and how they responded, I concluded they were getting a bad rap. What people were failing to see, is that mistakes were made like in any situation, but they came under attack by a highly sophisticated set of actors and any company would have had the same results. Q: The breach taught us that large companies are no longer confined, single entities that can hide behind a single firewall, but sprawling networks of interconnected vendors. How do you even begin to defend that? A: Target already had a robust vendor security program, and that is definitely a priority for me. But one of the principles I apply to information security isn't security-related at all. It's about simplification and consolidation. My geeky term for it is ''attack surface reduction.'' When you look at a multinational company, it makes DNA look simple. You don't need military-grade defense capabilities to figure out that you have too many connections. You have to simplify and consolidate those as much as possible and have adequate measures to detect and respond when those controls do fail. Q: We know that the criminals behind the Target attacks continue to scan networks for entry points. Are you still seeing that scanning activity on Target's network? A: There's always kids in the basement running scanners on the Internet, and bad guys who are well resourced, skilled and scanning the environment continually. In my background, most advanced attacks were done by guys in uniforms. I've done many board presentations about how those attacks occur, and what the anatomy of those attacks look like. In the retail space, I don't need different slides. It's the same tools, same process, same sophistication.

Deterring Cyberattacks From North Korea,"The recent cyberattack on Sony Pictures, which the Obama administration said was committed by North Korea, shows how far the United States still has to go to deter such intrusions, despite warnings by officials and experts about cybersecurity dangers. Countless assaults on America's computer networks by China and other foreign governments, hackers and criminals have demonstrated the urgent need for safeguards.  The attack on Sony is particularly alarming because it raises the possibility that North Korea, aware that sending troops into South Korea or unleashing a nuclear weapon will bring crushing retaliation from the United States, has found a more devious weapon against its adversaries. The incident should cause corporations and governments at every level -- federal, state and local -- to redouble efforts to protect their networks. Jason Healey, the director of the cyberprogram at The Atlantic Council, said that in nearly every significant past attack on private corporations, security companies like McAfee and Microsoft had been able to make improvements or stop more attacks. Solutions can be as straightforward as replacing computer passwords with biometric-identifying technology. Experts say many corporations are doing a better job on cybersecurity, but there is still a long way to go. The federal government also has a vital role. President Obama has promised a proportional response to what he has called ''cybervandalism'' by North Korea. One problem is that there are no international treaties or norms about how to use digital weapons or respond to cyberattacks. Even so, the United States, with a cybercommand and 6,000 trained personnel, is well on its way to developing a military cyberstructure. Other countries are also investing in cyberweapons. Obama administration officials say they are working on how to address the North Korean attack but regard using law enforcement as a first response. However, it's unclear whether indicting the hackers, putting North Korea back on the terrorism list or imposing new sanctions would have a significant effect. The most productive deterrent against further North Korean assaults may be to continue pressing China, where most of the North's hackers are based, to shut the operation and to make clear to the government of Kim Jong-un that such activities will not be tolerated. The Internet went dark in North Korea from time to time last week. The Obama administration denied playing any role in the disruptions. Some have speculated that China might have been involved; the Chinese government issued a statement against nations or individuals carrying out cyberassaults. But given China's own record, that statement may not be very meaningful. "
Flaw Found in Key Method for Protecting Data on the Internet,"The tiny padlock next to web addresses that promised to protect our most sensitive information - passwords, stored files, bank details, even Social Security numbers - is broken. A flaw has been discovered in one of the Internet's key encryption methods, making it urgent for virtually all Internet users to change their passwords. The vulnerability could also force a wide swath of websites to swap out the virtual keys that generate private connections between the sites and their customers. On Tuesday afternoon, many organizations were heeding the warning. Companies like Lastpass, the password manager, and Tumblr, the social network owned by Yahoo, said they had issued fixes and warned users to immediately swap out their usernames and passwords.  The vulnerability involves a serious bug in OpenSSL, the technology that powers encryption for two-thirds of web servers. It was revealed Monday by a team of Finnish security researchers who work for Codenomicon, a security company in Saratoga, Calif., and two security engineers at Google.  Researchers are calling the bug ""Heartbleed"" because it affects the ""heartbeat"" portion of the OpenSSL protocol, which pings messages back and forth. It can and has been exploited by attackers.  The bug allows attackers to access the memory on any web server running OpenSSL and take all sorts of information: customer usernames and passwords, sensitive banking details, trade secrets and the private encryption keys that organizations use to communicate privately with their customers. What makes the Heartbleed bug particularly severe is that it can be used by an attacker without leaving any digital crumbs behind. ""It's a serious bug in that it doesn't leave any trace,"" said David Chartier, the chief executive at Codenomicon. ""Bad guys can access the memory on a machine and take encryption keys, usernames, passwords, valuable intellectual property, and there's no trace they've been there."" Three security researchers at Codenomicon's offices in Oulu, Finland, first discovered the bug last Thursday. The researchers, Antti Karjalainen, Riku Hietamäki and Matti Kamunen, immediately alerted the Finnish authority that is charged with responsibly disclosing security bugs. As it turned out, a security researcher at Google, Neel Mehta, had also discovered the bug and the Google security team had been working on a fix. On Monday, the open-source team that oversees OpenSSL issued a warning to people and organizations about the bug, and encouraged anyone using the OpenSSL library to upgrade to the latest version, which fixes the problem. Security researchers say it is impossible to know whether an attacker used the bug to steal a victim's information, but found evidence that attackers were aware of the bug and had been exploiting it. Researchers monitoring various ""honeypots"" - stashes of fake data on the web aimed at luring hackers so researchers can learn more about their tools and techniques - found evidence that attackers had used the Heartbleed bug to access the fake data. But actual victims are out of luck. ""Unless an attacker blackmails you, or publishes your information online, or steals a trade secret and uses it, you won't know if you've been compromised,"" Mr. Chartier said. ""That's what makes it so vicious."" Security researchers are warning organizations to get new private encryption keys as quickly as possible, and warning people to start changing their usernames and passwords immediately, particularly for sensitive accounts like their online banking, email, file storage and e-commerce accounts. ""This still means that the little lock icon (HTTPS) we all trusted to keep our passwords, personal emails, and credit cards safe was actually making all that private information accessible to anyone who knew about the exploit,"" Tumblr's security team wrote on their site. ""This might be a good day to call in sick and take some time to change your passwords everywhere- especially your high-security services like email, file storage and banking, which may have been compromised by this bug."" Mr. Chartier advised users to consider their passwords gone. ""Companies need to get new encryption keys and users need to get new passwords immediately,"" he said. ""And do it quickly.""  "
Cybercriminals Zero In on a Lucrative New Target: Hedge Funds,"They say crime follows opportunity. Computer security experts say hedge funds, with their vast pools of money and opaque nature, have become perfect targets for sophisticated cybercriminals. Over the past two years, experts say, hedge funds have fallen victim to targeted attacks. What makes them such ripe targets is that even as hedge funds expend millions in moving their trading operations online, they have not made the same investment in security. The latest evidence comes in the form of a new report Wednesday from BAE Systems, a computer security firm, that an unnamed hedge fund lost millions of dollars after criminals installed malware on its trading systems late last year. The malware was designed to insert a lag time in the hedge fund's trading system and record the details of orders, so the attackers could trade on the information themselves.  According to BAE Systems, the attack began with a so-called spearphishing email, which contained links purporting to be about capital markets. Once they were clicked, an employee inadvertently downloaded malware onto a computer that gave criminals deeper access to the fund's trading systems. The attack was noticed only after the fund's analysts and tech staff discovered the lag times in its algorithmic trading strategy and abnormal file movement on its network. The breach, which was first reported by CNBC, cost the fund millions of dollars in recovery, according to BAE Systems, which did not name the fund. But security experts say the crime is hardly new. ""Hedge funds have been victims of targeted cyberattack over the past two years,"" said Tom Kellermann, the chief cybersecurity officer at TrendMicro. ""Hedge funds are woefully undersecured. The lack of investment in their cybersecurity has placed them in the line of fire."" The first such attacks on capital markets, Mr. Kellermann said, began in 1999, right around the time brokerage houses began to move private computer networks online. Early on, the most common mode of attack was to hack into a broker's account to steal user names and passwords so that hackers could trade securities under a victim's name. More recently, the most common attack on the financial industry has been distributed denial of service or DDoS attacks on banks from hackers based in Iran.  But unlike the DDoS attacks, which are a costly nuisance, the attacks against hedge funds are more sophisticated and profitable, experts say. The hedge fund industry has grown enormously in recent years and many have moved to digital trading systems, which allow funds to profit by trading milliseconds faster. By moving their trading operations online, though, funds have also become a target. ""The cybercrime underground is cognizant that convergence in the securities market has fostered a fertile environment for fraud,"" Mr. Kellermann said. ""These attacks are conducted for the purpose of front-running market participants."" Almost a decade ago, Mr. Kellermann wrote a report for the World Bank about financial fraud. The report outlined seven attack scenarios - all of which had been realized by 2005 - and warned that ""certain costs and risks associated with the e-finance revolution have yet to be fully appreciated."" Since then, Mr. Kellermann and others say the problem has only become worse. In addition to online trading swindles, in recent months numerous funds have been struck by Cryptolocker, the particularly vicious, so-called ransomware that encrypts infected users' files and demands a ransom to unlock them. Often, security experts say, these crimes go unreported by victims who fear that law enforcement agencies will dig through their systems. But increasingly, government officials are asking companies to step forward so that they can learn more about criminals' tools, techniques and patterns. At the annual RSA security conference in San Francisco last February, James B. Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, asked companies to start disclosing attacks. ""We understand that you are reluctant to report intrusions, either because you're worried the government will start rummaging around your networks or because you fear your reputation will take a hit in the marketplace,"" he said. ""We need to examine patterns and behaviors, to determine how they operate, and how best to stop them."" "
Energy Sector Faces Attacks From Hackers in Russia,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Russian hackers have been systematically targeting hundreds of Western oil and gas companies, as well as energy investment firms, according to private cybersecurity researchers. The motive behind the attacks appears to be industrial espionage -- a natural conclusion given the importance of Russia's oil and gas industry, the researchers said. The manner in which the Russian hackers are targeting the companies also gives them the opportunity to seize control of industrial control systems from afar, in much the same way the United States and Israel were able to use the Stuxnet computer worm in 2009 to take control of an Iranian nuclear facility's computer systems and destroy a fifth of the country's uranium supply, the researchers said.  The Russian attacks, which have affected over 1,000 organizations in more than 84 countries, were first discovered in August 2012 by researchers at CrowdStrike, a security company in Irvine, Calif. The company noticed an unusually sophisticated and aggressive Russian group targeting the energy sector, in addition to health care, governments and defense contractors. The group was named ''Energetic Bear'' because the vast majority of its victims were oil and gas companies. And CrowdStrike's researchers believed the hackers were backed by the Russian government given their apparent resources and sophistication and because the attacks occurred during Moscow working hours. A report released Monday by Symantec, a computer security company based in Mountain View, Calif., detailed similar conclusions and added a new element -- the Stuxnet-like remote control capability. In addition to basic hacking techniques, like sending mass emails containing malicious links or attachments, the group infected websites frequented by energy workers and investors in what is known as a ''watering hole attack.'' In this attack, instead of targeting a victim's computer network directly, hackers infect websites their targets visit often -- like an online menu for a Chinese restaurant -- with malicious software. Without knowing it, workers visiting that site inadvertently download the so-called malware and help the hackers get inside their computer network. The Russian hackers were careful to cover their tracks, the researchers said. They hid their malware using encryption techniques that made it difficult to identify their tools and where they came from. In some cases, researchers found evidence that the hackers were probing the core of victims' machines, the part of the computer known as the BIOS, or basic input/output system. Unlike software, which can be patched and updated, once a computer's hardware gets infected, it typically becomes unusable. F-Secure, the Finnish security firm, also told its clients last week about the Russian hacking group, which Symantec has named ''Dragonfly.'' In the past six months, researchers say the group has become more aggressive and sophisticated. The Russian hackers have been breaking into the networks of industrial control software, or I.C.S., makers, inserting so-called Trojans into the software used by many oil and energy firms to allow employees to remotely get access to industrial control systems. So when oil and gas companies downloaded the latest version of the software, they inadvertently downloaded the hackers' malware as well. At least three industrial control software developers were affected, according to researchers at Symantec, F-Secure and CrowdStrike. The first was a maker of remote access tools for industrial control systems; the second, a European manufacturer of specialized industrial control devices; and the third, a European company that develops systems to manage wind turbines, natural gas plants and other energy infrastructure. They were not named by the security companies because of confidentiality agreements. Security researchers estimate that more than 250 companies downloaded the infected software updates. ''These infections not only gave the attackers a beachhead in the targeted organizations' networks, but also gave them the means to mount sabotage operations against infected I.C.S. computers,'' Symantec wrote in its report Monday. There was no evidence the Russian group intended to use its toehold in some networks to inflict damage, like blowing up an oil rig or power facility, said Kevin Haley, the director of security response at Symantec, in an interview. The apparent motive, Mr. Haley said, was to learn more about energy companies' operations, strategic plans and technology. ''But the potential for sabotage is there,'' he added. More recently, Energetic Bear has been targeting companies in the financial sector, said Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike's head of threat intelligence. In particular, the group has been attacking, with the watering hole technique, some websites frequented by firms that invest in the energy sector. Once someone visits an infected site, Mr. Meyers said, attackers will infect their system, scan their device to see if it is worth hacking, and then install sophisticated hacking tools. For devices deemed uninteresting, the attackers simply clean up their tools and move along. ''They are very aggressive,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''And very careful to cover their tracks.'' "
U.S. Finds Hacker Tool Widespread,"Updated, 8:07 p.m. | More than 1,000 American businesses have been affected by the cyberattack that hit the in-store cash register systems at Target, Supervalu and most recently UPS Stores, the Department of Homeland Security said in an advisory released on Friday. The attacks were much more pervasive than previously reported, the advisory said, and hackers were pilfering the data of millions of payment cards from American consumers without companies knowing about it. The breadth of the breaches, once considered limited to a handful of businesses, underscored the vulnerability of payment systems widely used by retail stores across the country.  On July 31, Homeland Security, along with the Secret Service, the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center and their partners in the security industry, warned companies to check their in-store cash register systems for a malware package that security experts called Backoff after a word that appeared in its code. Until that point, Backoff malware and variations of it were undetectable by antivirus products. Since then, seven companies that sell and manage in-store cash register systems have confirmed to government officials that they each had multiple clients affected, the government said Friday. Some of those clients, like UPS and Supervalu, have stepped forward, but most have not. In all, the Secret Service estimated that more than 1,000 American businesses had been affected. According to the Secret Service, criminals are actively scanning corporate systems for remote access opportunities -- a vendor with remote access to a company's systems, for example, or employees with the ability to work remotely -- and then deploying computers to guess user names and passwords at high speeds until they find a working combination. The hackers use those footholds to crawl through corporate networks until they gain access to the in-store cash register systems. From there, criminals collect payment card data off the cash register systems and send it back to their servers abroad. Last year, in the largest known breach against a retailer's payment system, hackers invaded Target for weeks without being detected. The hackers' malware stole customers' data directly off the magnetic stripes of credit and debit cards used by tens of millions of shoppers. Gregg Steinhafel, Target's chief executive, and Beth M. Jacob, the company's chief information officer, stepped down from their positions, largely because of the breach. The Target breach exposed problems with the magnetic stripes on credit cards. Since then, banks and companies have taken a renewed interest in a chip-based smart card standard known as E.M.V., short for Europay-MasterCard-Visa, the technology's first backers. Credit card companies have set an October 2015 deadline for American retailers to upgrade their payment systems. ''The weakness is the magnetic stripe,'' said Avivah Litan, a security analyst for Gartner Research. ''I can buy a mag stripe reader on eBay and easily read all the data from your credit card. It's an antiquated technology from the '60s.'' E.M.V. makes counterfeiting far more difficult than magnetic stripe cards, but analysts say they believe that most retailers will not meet the October 2015 deadline because of the cost to upgrade their terminals -- from $500 to $1,000 per terminal, according to Javelin Strategy & Research. With cash register malware rampant, however, they may have no choice. Millions of American consumers' payment card details are being sold on the black market, many of them taken from American companies that do not know their systems have been breached. Unless companies search for Backoff on their systems, it can be difficult to identify. The Homeland Security report released on Friday recommends that companies contact their service providers, antivirus vendors and cash register system vendors to assess whether they have been compromised or are vulnerable to attack. In its advisory in July, the Secret Service and Homeland Security recommended that companies limit the number of vendors with access to their internal network; require long, complex passwords that cannot easily be cracked by a computer; and lock employees and vendors out of their accounts after multiple login requests. The agencies recommended that companies segregate crucial systems, like their cash registers, from corporate networks and install so-called two-factor authentication, which is a method that requires employees to enter a second, one-time password in addition to their usual credentials. They also suggested that companies encrypt customers' data from the moment their cards are swiped in the store, log all network activity and deploy security software that can alert technicians to unusual activity, like a cash register in a UPS Store in Tennessee communicating with a server in Russia.

"On the Hunt for Hackers, but Not the Spotlight","Lawrence Baldwin is a dark hero of the Internet whom you have probably never heard of - and for good reason. A decade ago, Mr. Baldwin made a name for himself and his Atlanta-based security firm, myNetWatchman, by collecting and analyzing digital scourges like malware, and alerting companies to them. He was a fixture on the security conference circuit and was often quoted in the press about security threats. And then he seemed to disappear. Beyond a bare-bones website and a LinkedIn profile where his only listed interest is ""chasing down cybercriminals and smacking them upside the head,"" Mr. Baldwin largely vanished from the web. ""If you look for me on Google, you'd be hard pressed to find my involvement in anything for the last seven or eight years,"" he said.  Yet Mr. Baldwin is well known to a number of large United States banks and financial institutions that have turned to him for help in combating increasingly sophisticated hacking attacks. He declined to discuss his work for the banks, citing concerns about his personal safety. For the past seven years, several security consultants and former law enforcement personnel say, Mr. Baldwin has immersed himself in the so-called dark web, using what most describe as unorthodox methods to gather intelligence about online financial crime. Mr. Baldwin, 49, says that he is able to closely monitor many of the criminals who he says have made ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" hacking into American banks and corporations. It is that unusual proximity - and the reliable information that it produces - that has made Mr. Baldwin one of the go-to consultants for financial institutions. Those familiar with his work say he is one of the consultants used by banks like JPMorgan Chase, which is still dealing with the fallout from an intrusion that compromised some information for 76 million households and seven million small businesses. To his supporters, Mr. Baldwin, who has a degree in computer science from the University of Hartford, is something of a secret agent. ""He has eyes directly on the perpetrator,"" said one security expert who did not want to be identified because of Mr. Baldwin's preference for a low profile. Another described his work as ""very cloak and dagger."" All agree that the intelligence he provides is very effective. ""I would take his intelligence over anyone else's any day of the week,"" another said. Companies often complain that when they are breached, they rarely learn anything about their attackers from law enforcement. Security companies are also little help. Many victims of breaches say these companies bury their analysts in heaps of data without offering any context or attribution. By the time chief information security officers discover that their data has left the building, executives complain, the criminals have already moved on. All of this has created a market for a handful of consultants like Mr. Baldwin who go undercover and track the criminals' activity in real time.""Baldwin stands out because he provides actionable intelligence,"" said Avivah Litan, a security analyst with Gartner, the research firm. ""It's exact, it's original and he barely charges for it, whereas other firms repackage intelligence from many sources."" She added, ""There's a finite number of original sources for intelligence on bad activities."" Yet while banks and Wall Street firms rely on Mr. Baldwin's services, they do not like to talk about it. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said she could not comment on whether the bank consulted with Mr. Baldwin. JPMorgan, which spends $250 million annually on digital security, has about 1,000 dedicated security personnel. But the bank also works with a handful of outside-threat intelligence providers in addition to consulting firms like Booz Allen Hamilton and Stroz Friedberg\x83\x96 to investigate attacks, said other people briefed on the matter. For his part, Mr. Baldwin maintains that he did not work directly with JPMorgan to solve its recent breach. He was slightly more open in March about his work, as he discussed the details of a recent attack against a bank during a presentation to the Georgia Banking Association. Mr. Baldwin asked the attendees not to discuss the talk with reporters. The reason for the banks' caution is that the information Mr. Baldwin provides becomes useless as soon as it is made public - and because many of his clients are not quite sure where Mr. Baldwin's information comes from. Two people familiar with his methods said that Mr. Baldwin's company maintains listening posts on Internet service provider networks and infects tools used by criminals, like underground botnets - networks of infected computers - to see what criminals are collecting and where they are collecting it from. He has also developed a web of contacts across industries and knows who is stealing information. ""He has gone underground and become privy to what they're developing,"" said Ms. Litan, of Gartner. ""There's no other way. It's the way."" A few years ago, law enforcement officials spoke to Mr. Baldwin to ensure he understood what he could do without breaking the law, according to two people briefed on the conversation. One concern is that while Mr. Baldwin has a record of developing intelligence on hacker activity, the information cannot be used as evidence in a criminal proceeding because of his methods, and the confidential relationships he uses to gather it. Still, law enforcement officials who have worked with him describe Mr. Baldwin as a valuable partner. Thomas Grasso, a supervisory special agent with the F.B.I., said the bureau ""had a very good working relationship with Mr. Baldwin and his company over the years,"" and had worked with him and others in the private sector to stay ahead of online threats. Mr. Baldwin did not start out as a security guru. Early in his career he worked at BellSouth, helping to introduce its dial-up network. Immediately, hackers tried to break in. What began as a curiosity - figuring out who they were and how they attacked their victims - became his life's work. In an industry dominated by those who charge high fees for other people's intelligence, one person said, Mr. Baldwin stands out as a ""boy scout"" who simply wants to catch criminals and routinely shares information free. With prosecutions and extraditions of hackers rare, Mr. Baldwin is motivated, say those familiar with him, to do everything possible to disrupt their businesses. He works closely with the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, a nonprofit based in Pittsburgh that brings together law enforcement, private industry members, security consultants and academic scholars to share information to prevent and mitigate the threats. The group works closely with many American banks and corporations and has received contributions in recent years from Bank of America, Microsoft and Symantec. Some have likened Mr. Baldwin's sleuthing to that of Brian Krebs, the security blogger who earned attention investigating Russian spammers and has been pranked by spammers as a result. But security researchers say Mr. Baldwin's investigations take him much deeper into the netherworld of the web. That explains Mr. Baldwin's low profile over the past few years. ""I'm not a press hound,"" he said. ""There are serious personal safety issues to consider.""                       "
Report Analyzes Extent of Data Breaches in California,"SAN FRANCISCO - The constant drumbeat of data breaches won't cease anytime soon, according to a new report from California's attorney general, Kamala D. Harris. There were 167 data breaches reported in California last year, an increase of 28 percent from the 131 data breaches reported the previous year. The information of more than 18.5 million California residents was compromised in 2013, a significant jump from the 2.5 million compromised records in 2012.  Those numbers were skewed by two widespread breaches last year. At Target, personal records for 41 million people were compromised, and at LivingSocial, hackers gained access to 50 million records. According to the attorney general, each of these two breaches put 7.5 million California residents' information at risk. The majority of breaches - 53 percent - were because of malware and hacking, while a smaller number, 26 percent, was attributed to the physical loss of a computer or device. The report reiterates what many already knew: There is much more information to be stolen through hacking than physical loss. The vast majority of the 17 million records compromised in California last year - 93 percent - were attributable to malware or hacking, whereas only 1.15 million records were compromised by the physical loss of an electronic device. The retail industry was the biggest target for hackers. Retail breaches affected 15.4 million records belonging to California residents - 84 percent of total records compromised. Companies in the financial services sector were the second most popular target, comprising 20 percent of all breaches, while health care companies comprised 15 percent of all reported victims. Social Security numbers were the most frequently compromised records in 2013, not surprising given that Social Security numbers fetch top dollar on the black market, selling for more than even debit card information. Security experts say this is because the amount of fraud resulting from a Social Security number is much greater than the amount of fraud that results from stolen payment information. According to the California attorney general's report, the average amount of fraud caused by a single Social Security number is $2,330 compared with $2,026 for a debit card and $1,251 for a stolen credit card. While most companies that have lost Social Security information often offer free credit monitoring, the report found that some 29 percent of companies who could have offered free credit monitoring or identity protection services after a data breach last year chose not to. Payment card data accounted for 38 percent of data breaches in California in 2013, followed by stolen medical information, which accounted for 19 percent of stolen data. In its report, the attorney general's office urged retailers and companies that handle personal or payment card information to move quickly to encrypt customers' personal, medical and payment card data. The report says retailers, in particular, should devalue stolen payment card information by migrating to payment systems that use surrogate tokens, instead of the actual payment card data. By using such tokens, the attorney general's office said, payment data stolen from one institution cannot be used to make a future payment or counterfeit a stolen credit card. The payment industry is already pushing merchants to adopt such systems and has set a soft deadline of October 2015, when new rules about fraud liability go into effect. Under the new rules, companies that have had a data breach could be held accountable for any fraudulent charges if they have not upgraded to the new system.                       "
Android Phones Hit by 'Ransomware',"You are guilty of child porn, child abuse, zoophilia or sending out bulk spam. You are a criminal. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has locked you out of your phone and the only way to regain access to all your data is to pay a few hundred dollars. That message - or variations of it - has popped up on hundreds of thousands of people's Android devices in just the last month. The message claims to be from the F.B.I., or cybersecurity firms, but is in fact the work of Eastern European hackers who are hijacking Android devices with a particularly pernicious form of malware, dubbed ""ransomware"" because it holds its victims' devices hostage until they pay a ransom.  Ransomware is not new. Five years ago, criminals in Eastern Europe began holding PC users' devices hostage with similar tools. The scheme was so successful that security experts say many cybercriminals have abandoned spam and fake antivirus frauds to take up ransomware full time. By 2012, security experts had identified more than 16 gangs extorting millions from ransomware victims around the world. Now those same criminals are taking their scheme mobile, successfully infecting Android devices at disturbing rates. In just the last 30 days, roughly 900,000 people were infected with a form of ransomware called ""ScarePackage,"" according to Lookout, a San Francisco-based mobile security firm. ""This is, by far, the biggest U.S. targeted threat of ransomware we've seen,"" said Jeremy Linden, a senior security product manager at Lookout. ""In the past month, a single piece of malware has infected as many devices in the U.S., as a quarter of all families of malware in 2013."" In addition to ScarePackage, Mr. Linden and a team at Lookout have also been tracking another strain of ransomware dubbed ""ColdBrother,"" or ""Sypeng,"" which not only locks users out of their device, but can take a photo from the device's camera, can answer and drop phone calls and search for banking applications on the device. And in just the last three weeks, Lookout discovered a new form of ransomware called ScareMeNot, which has already managed to infect more than 30,000 Android devices. Victims get infected with the ransomware through a method known as a ""drive-by download"" in which they simply need visit a website - in some cases a pornography site -  to inadvertently download the ransomware onto their machine. In other cases, they download the ransomware by downloading fake apps that masquerade as popular services such as Adobe Flash or an anti-virus product. Once infected, it is very difficult to remove. Typically, criminals will flash a fake image onto the user's screen which purports to be from the F.B.I. or Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm now owned by FireEye, or a U.S. cyber crime task force, informing them that they have violated a law and will not be able to regain access to their device and data until they have paid several hundred dollars in a Moneypak voucher. It is unclear whether users will then actually regain access to their device if they pay. Lookout said it did not get that far because it refused to pay any money to cybercriminals. By reverse coding the ransomware, Lookout's engineers found several clues indicating that the ransomware's authors are of Eastern European origin. Russian and Slavic words and slang appeared in the code. Lookout's chief technology officer, Kevin Mahaffey, cautioned that Android users not ""freak out."" Mr. Mahaffey suggested that people be careful about links they visit and where they download apps from. ""There's malware in the Google Play store but there's more malware outside Google Play,"" Mr. Mahaffey said. Most importantly, Mr. Mahaffey said, if you do find yourself inadvertently installing an application, be sure not to grant the application any administrator privileges. Of course, Lookout has a vested interest in publicizing this mobile ransomware threat. Lookout, which just received $150 million in venture capital financing, detects and stops these strains of ransomware from infecting users who download its mobile app for Android and iPhones.

How Not to Pay the Price for Free Wi-Fi,"Part of globe-trotting nowadays is flitting from one free Wi-Fi network to the next. From hotel lobby to coffee shop to subway platform to park, each time we join a public network we put our personal information and privacy at risk. Yet few travelers are concerned enough to turn down free Wi-Fi. Rather, many of us hastily give away an email address in exchange for 15 minutes of free airport Internet access. So how to feed your addiction while also safeguarding your passwords and privacy? If you're not going to abstain (and who is these days?), here are four rules for staying connected and (reasonably) safe while traveling. 1. MAKE SURE THAT ANY SITE YOU VISIT HAS 'HTTPS' IN FRONT OF THE URL. Those five letters indicate that the page is encrypted, which prevents others from seeing what you're doing. If you're browsing the web in a Starbucks or any place with an open network and you do not see ''https,'' it's possible that someone there with nefarious intentions can see the site you're visiting and the exact pages you request on that site.  ''They can see that you're connecting to Amazon and that you're looking for remedial algebra books,'' said Nadia Heninger, an assistant professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. Indeed, the only part of an e-commerce site that may be encrypted is the page where you access your account information or enter your credit card number. Sites like Gmail.com and Yahoo.com use ''https'' by default, but type your password into a web-based email site that does not use it and a third party could see (and steal) that password. This sort of eavesdropping is easier than you might think. There are a number of tools that allow anyone who downloads them to see all the data that flies back and forth between a browser and a web server, said Jason Hong, an associate professor at the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Moreover, anyone can set up a Wi-Fi network for criminal purposes and give it a legitimate-sounding name. Say, for example, you're in the Paris Métro and you join a free network that looks like an official city initiative. ''You have no idea what Wi-Fi network that is,'' Professor Heninger said. ''It could be set up by a hacker.'' And if he or she has malicious intentions, when you go to a popular site like Facebook you may actually be logging into a fake page that allows the hacker to steal your password. ''It is surprisingly common,'' Professor Heninger said. But surely, using Wi-Fi at a hotel is safe, right? ''That's only marginally better,'' Professor Hong said. On the bright side, he said it's unlikely that a criminal would bother monitoring the hotel's traffic for a few passwords because the cost-benefit is simply not there. That person would get a bigger payoff from phishing emails, Professor Hong said, in which the sender masquerades as a known source like your bank or credit card company to get sensitive information like your banking passwords. Even so, protect your computer by ensuring that your web browsers are up-to-date. Turn on your firewall and turn off file sharing. 2. USE A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK, OR VPN. If you work for a corporation, chances are you either already have one or have a technology department that can give you one. Using a VPN essentially encrypts all your online traffic, ensuring that no one can eavesdrop. It also routes that activity through whoever owns the VPN (your employer). So if, for example, I'm in a hotel in Japan using my VPN, all of my traffic gets sent to The New York Times's servers and is then redirected again so it appears as if it is coming from The Times rather than from a hotel room in Japan. To access the VPN, users are typically given a name and a password and often also a constantly changing set of numbers on a fob that must be entered to access the network. Don't have a VPN? There's Tor, software that prevents third parties from seeing your location or the sites you visit. ''It's totally free and fairly easy to use,'' said Professor Heninger, who uses Tor. The software can be downloaded at Torproject.org. 3. SIGN UP FOR TWO-STEP VERIFICATION. More and more sites -- Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, WordPress -- allow users to set up their accounts so that signing in requires two ways of proving who they are. The most common method requires a password you create plus a code that is sent to you -- via text message or through a special app -- each time you wish to sign in. For instance, let's say you logged onto a fake Facebook page and hackers captured your user name and password. If that happened without two-step verification (known on Facebook as ''login approvals''), the hackers could access your account when you log off. If, however, you had enabled login approvals, even though your user name and password were captured, the hackers would not be able to log into your account because they wouldn't receive the requisite code. Now, if you're someone who uses the same password for everything, this is where you still run into trouble. Here's why: If your user name and password for Facebook are the same as those for another website that does not have two-step verification, hackers might figure that out and break into your other accounts. Yes, I know, you can't keep all your passwords straight. That's why there are password managers like 1Password and LastPass, which can create and store long, unique passwords. 4. BRING ONLY WHAT YOU NEED AND TURN OFF WHAT YOU'RE NOT USING. The latter goes for Wi-Fi and for Bluetooth. ''It's just another way to be compromised,'' Professor Heninger said. And don't give away your email address or download an app in exchange for free Wi-Fi. ''Think about the recipient of that information,'' she said. ''You have no idea who set up that Wi-Fi network,'' she continued, adding ''You might have just downloaded an app that will download all your contacts.'' When it comes to travel booking and organization apps, one security concern is how much of your personal information the app is sharing, and with whom. Professor Hong said that, in general, apps that charge a fee are better because they have a revenue model. Those that do not are more likely to sell your information. He added that whether they are free or not, apps are also a potential security risk because they do not always encrypt your data when communicating to Web servers. If you're seriously concerned about security, Professor Heninger suggests creating a special travel email address and password. And she recommends buying a ''travel laptop'' that you load with only the information you need. Indeed, Professor Hong said he would worry more about the theft of your computer than your various passwords. He cited an incident in 2000 in which the laptop of the Qualcomm chief executive at the time, Irwin Jacobs, disappeared at a conference in Irvine, Calif. ''He turned his back and the laptop was gone,'' Professor Hong said. Average travelers, he continued, should be just as mindful, if not more, of having their smartphone plucked from their hand by a thief on the street. ''Attackers usually go for the easiest thing,'' he said. ''Don't ever underestimate the power of snatch and grab.'' "
Chinese Businessman Is Charged in Plot to Steal U.S. Military Data,"WASHINGTON -- A Chinese businessman in Canada hacked into Boeing's computers and stole information about United States military aircraft and weapons, the Justice Department said on Friday, describing a corporate espionage case that is unusual for the huge amount of data involved. The businessman, Su Bin, spent years taking data from Boeing, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in court documents, and working with two unidentified contacts in China sought to sell the information to companies there.  There is no indication that the Chinese government orchestrated the attacks, or that anyone breached classified systems or stole classified information. But the assault on one of the nation's most sophisticated military contractors is a reminder that even seemingly safe computer systems are vulnerable. In March, Chinese hackers broke into computers that stored the personal information of all United States government employees. In May, the Justice Department accused five Chinese officials with hacking into Westinghouse Electric, United States Steel and other companies. Mr. Bin owned a Chinese aviation company called Lode Tech that had offices in Canada, where Mr. Bin lived. He was arrested there on June 28, the F.B.I. said, and is expected in court there later this month for a bail hearing. The Justice Department is seeking his extradition to the United States. He is charged with unauthorized computer access. ''We remain deeply concerned about cyber-enabled theft of sensitive information and we have repeatedly made it clear that the United States will continue using all the tools our government possesses to strengthen cybersecurity and confront cybercrime,'' Marc Raimondi, a Justice Department spokesman, said. Court documents do not say how the hackers breached Boeing's computers. But Noel A. Neeman, the F.B.I. agent who wrote the document, describes a general strategy that will be familiar to anyone whose email or social media accounts have been compromised: Hackers send an email with a link to a malicious piece of code. Clicking on that link gives hackers access to computer systems. While court documents quote from emails describing elaborate hacking schemes and successful efforts to obtain aircraft schematics, Mr. Neeman writes that those accounts ''could have been exaggerated.'' The hackers' description of Boeing's computer network is not accurate and the confidential design information they claim to have seized was stored across multiple servers, including two on Air Force bases, Mr. Neeman writes. A Boeing spokeswoman said the company was cooperating with the investigation. Boeing was first breached in January 2010, and according to emails obtained by the F.B.I., more than 65 gigabytes of data was stolen over the next two years. The primary focus was Boeing's C-17 military cargo plane. The documents also indicate that the three men stole a comparatively small amount of information related to Lockheed Martin's F-22 and F-35 jets. It is not clear from the documents how that breach occurred. Boeing will cease production of the C-17 next year after two decades building the planes. The Chinese government is developing its own cargo plane, which is similar in some respects to the C-17. The court documents describe efforts to sell the seized information in China, including to state-owned companies, but it does not say whether the hackers succeeded. No defense lawyer is named in the court documents, which were filed in Los Angeles. Computer breaches are a major source of friction between the United States and China. The United States says it hacks computers only to gain national security information, while China uses it to gain an economic advantage. But evidence revealed by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, shows the N.S.A. went deep into the computer systems of Huawei, a major maker of computer network equipment, and ran many programs to intercept the conversations of Chinese leaders and the military.

Smart Steps at the Online Checkout,"For years, consumers were nervous about shopping online, figuring that entering a credit card number into a website was scarier than offering the card in a store. Times sure have changed. Online shopping is booming; Forrester Research predicts Americans will spend $89 billion online this holiday season, 13 percent more than last year. And shopping online has proved safer than in-store buying in recent years. Some of the biggest recent data breaches have involved in-store payment systems, while major online breaches, like the one at eBay, usually don't involve credit card data.  Nevertheless, security breaches can happen, so it is wise to take precautions when shopping online. The best thing you can do is use a credit card, not a debit card, for online purchases. If your credit card number is stolen, your liability for unauthorized purchases is minimized, whereas a stolen debit card number can drain your bank account if you don't notice or report the theft quickly enough. In addition, look for sites that connect to the Internet securely. You can tell by looking for a green padlock symbol and the letters https (rather than http) in the URL bar. Prominent sites like Amazon or Etsy offer these sort of security measures. Note that some sites, like Best Buy, may not show the secure URL or icon until you start the checkout process. If you encounter a site that doesn't offer such security, don't shop there, plain and simple. Insecure websites may send your personal information in a way that can be easily intercepted by hackers. This is especially true if you are browsing on a public Wi-Fi network like those at coffee shops or airports. Avoid online shopping and other activities like banking on public networks - and if you must do those activities, certainly stay away from insecure sites. You will probably have the best experience with major retailers and banks, which generally do a good job of protecting your information. If you want to buy something from a smaller merchant, look for reviews on sites like the Better Business Bureau or Reseller Ratings. Or you can search for the item you want on shopping comparison sites like Google Shopping, Yahoo Shopping or Nextag, which compare retailers and will specify trusted sources. You can take steps to protect your financial information at the sites where you shop, as well. For example, if you store your credit card information with sites like Amazon to ease checkout, protect that online account with a strong password, and don't use the same password on other sites. Also, be judicious about the sites where you choose to store credit card information. If you want your credit card number handy, some password vaults like LastPass and 1Password include autofill features, letting you store those numbers along with your address and other information for faster checkout. Just make sure you have a strong password to log into those vaults and use a password on any computer or phone where you use those services. Mobile payment services like Apple Pay are another secure method for online checkout. In apps that have integrated Apple Pay, you can check out by using your fingerprint to authorize a purchase, which will be charged to a credit card you have stored in Apple's Passbook app. The app you are using will never see your credit card information and, in some cases, you won't even have to create a user account - meaning hardly any data trail at all. As hackers grow ever more sophisticated, however, there may be times when you simply can't protect yourself online. For example, this year's Heartbleed vulnerability meant that sites supposedly protected by an extra security layer - those with that https in their URL - could actually be insecure, and the user would never know. That's why it is best to make sure you are as protected as you can be, by using credit cards, checking statements often and using strong passwords for online shopping.                       "
Banks' Lawsuits Against Target for Losses Related to Hacking Can Continue,"A federal judge on Tuesday handed an early victory to banks in their effort to recoup losses from a major breach last year at Target. More than 40 million credit cards were compromised in the incident.  A United States District Judge in Minnesota, Paul A. Magnuson, rejected Target's bid to dismiss lawsuits by financial institutions that claim Target had played a ""key role"" in allowing its computer systems to be compromised. The ruling is one of the first court decisions to clarify the legal confusion between retailers and banks in data breaches. In the past, banks were often left with the financial burden of a hacking and were responsible for replacing stolen cards. The cost of replacing stolen cards from Target's breach alone is roughly $400 million - and the Secret Service has estimated that some 1,000 American merchants may have suffered from similar attacks.  The Target ruling makes clear that banks have a right to go after merchants if they can provide evidence that the merchant may have been negligent in securing its systems. While the lawsuit continues, lawyers say this early ruling could have widespread impact in the onslaught of data breach cases this year. The judge ruled that charges that Target ignored security software alerts and disabled some of its security features was enough for the banks to pursue a claim of negligence. ""The allocation of risk in any data breach is a hot-button issue,"" said Craig Newman, managing partner of Richards Kibbe & Orbe. ""What this ruling means is that the banks won't necessarily be left holding the bag if the merchant was negligent in the way it maintained and safeguarded customer information."" In the past, the liability for breaches was governed by a complex series of contracts between merchants, payment processors and credit card companies. Mr. Newman said that Tuesday's ruling was the beginning of a new ""legal road map in determining who's responsible for paying the significant costs associated with a hacking incident.""  Five banks - including Umpqua Bank in Roseburg, Ore.; Mutual Bank in Whitman, Mass.; Village Bank in St. Francis, Minn.; CSE Federal Credit Union in Lake Charles, La.; and First Federal Savings Bank in Lorain, Ohio - are pursuing class-action status and seeking millions of dollars in damages. (Consumers are also pursuing separate class-action suits related to the breach).  ""Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Target's actions and inactions - disabling certain security features and failing to heed the warning signs as hackers' attack began - caused foreseeable harm to plaintiffs,"" Judge Magnuson wrote in his ruling on Tuesday. ""Plaintiffs have also plausibly alleged that Target's conduct both caused and exacerbated the harm they suffered."" Target declined to comment, citing a policy not to comment on active litigation.   At the time of its breach last year, Target had installed a $1.6 million advanced breach detection technology from the company FireEye. But according to several people briefed on its internal investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the technology sounded alarms that Target did not heed until hackers had already made off with credit and debit card information for 40 million customers and personal information for 110 million customers.                       "
Entry Point of JPMorgan Data Breach Is Identified,"The computer breach at JPMorgan Chase this summer - the largest intrusion of an American bank to date - might have been thwarted if the bank had installed a simple security fix to an overlooked server in its vast network, said people who have been briefed on internal and outside investigations into the attack. Big corporations like JPMorgan spend millions - $250 million in the bank's case - on computer security every year to guard against increasingly sophisticated attacks like the one on Sony Pictures. But the weak spot at JPMorgan appears to have been a very basic one, the people said. They did not want to be identified publicly because the investigation into the attack is incomplete. Theattack against the bank began last spring, after hackers stole the login credentials for a JPMorgan employee, these people said. Still, the attack could have been stopped there.  Most big banks use a double authentication scheme, known as two-factor authentication, which requires a second one-time password to gain access to a protected system. But JPMorgan's security team had apparently neglected to upgrade one of its network servers with the dual password scheme, the people briefed on the matter said. That left the bank vulnerable to intrusion. The oversight is now the focus of an internal review at JPMorgan that seeks to identify whether there are any other unguarded holes in the bank's vast network, several of the people briefed on the matter said, adding that, internally, the episode is seen as an embarrassment. The relatively simple nature of the attack - some details of which have not been previously reported - puts the breach in a new light. In August, when Bloomberg News first reported on the attack, which ultimately compromised some account information for 83 million households and small businesses, the bank's security experts and the Federal Bureau of Investigation feared a sophisticated adversary. Some suspected the attack, possibly with backing from Russia, was intended as retaliation against economic sanctions levied by the United States and its alliesin response to Russia's policies in Ukraine. By mid-October, however, that theory began to fray, and the F.B.I. officially ruled out the Russian government as a culprit. It is still not known where the attack originated. The internal investigation at the bank is known as Rio. Though early on some officials suspected that at least one of the attackers' computers was in Brazil, the attack could have been routed through computers anywhere. The basis for the internal name is unclear. In the aftermath of the attack, JPMorgan has set up a ""business control group"" of about a dozen technology and cybersecurity executives to assess the fallout and to prevent hackers from breaching its network in the future. The group has been holding meetings once every few weeks. The bank maintains that the damage to customers was limited to the theft of email passwords, home addresses and phone numbers. ""These criminals accessed customer contact information, but no account information,"" said Patricia Wexler, a bank spokeswoman. ""We have seen no evidence of fraud as a result of this."" JPMorgan discovered the hackers inside its systems in August, after first finding that the same group of hackers had breached a website for a charitable race that the bank sponsors. The revelation that a simple flaw was at issue may help explain why several other financial institutions that were targets of the same hackers were not ultimately affected nearly as much as JPMorgan Chase was. To date, only two other institutions have suffered some kind of intrusion, but those breaches were said to be relatively minor by people briefed on the attacks. What is clear is JPMorgan's attack did not involve the use of a so-called zero day attack - the kind of sophisticated, completely novel software bug that can sell for a million dollars on the black market. Nor did hackers use the kind of destructive malware that government officials say hackers in North Korea used to sabotage data at Sony Pictures. Nonetheless, once inside JPMorgan, hackers did manage to gain high-level access to more than 90 bank servers, but were caught before they could retrieve private customer financial information, the people briefed on the investigations said. The breach, which the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are treating as a criminal investigation, was not stopped until the second week of August. The National Security Agency - which does not often get involved in most attacks on a private company - has been working with JPMorgan because the bank, particularly given its size, is considered to be part of the nation's ""critical infrastructure."" Two people briefed on the matter said that an N.S.A. special team will sometimes work with a corporate victim of hackers to ensure that no trap doors remain. It is not clear why the vulnerability in the bank's network had gone unaddressed previously. But this summer's hack occurred during a period of high turnover in the bank's cybersecurity team with many departing for First Data, a payments processor. A large part of the problem, security experts say, is that it has become nearly impossible for banks of JPMorgan's size to secure their networks, particularly as they integrate the networks of companies they acquire with their own. This has been a particular headache at JPMorgan, where it is still not uncommon for the name ""Bank One"" - a lender JPMorgan merged with a decade ago - to pop up in a web URL. In August, the same month JPMorgan discovered hackers had been lurking in its system for months, the Department of Homeland Security warned companies that such acquisitions posed a critical threat. The agency said then that a critical American manufacturing company had been infiltrated by ""multiple, sophisticated threat actors over a period of several months"" using the networks of companies it had acquired in recent years. JPMorgan's push to fortify its computer security comes as regulators prod banks to better vet their vendors. JPMorgan, for example, has yet to give the green light to Simmco Data Systems, the small Michigan company that runs the website of JPMorgan's Corporate Challenge charitable race website, to resume operations. It was only after JPMorgan found that the Corporate Challenge website had been breached that it learned its own network had been attacked by the same hackers. David Simms, chief executive of Simmco, declined to comment, noting that ""this is an active federal investigation."" Several state attorneys general, led by George Jepsen of Connecticut, are still investigating the breach, as are federal prosecutors in Manhattan under Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the borough. Representatives for the F.B.I., Mr. Bharara and Mr. Jepsen all declined to comment. An N.S.A. spokesman said the intelligence agency would defer to the F.B.I., which has been overseeing the investigation. About two weeks ago, JPMorgan's legal department sent an email to a number of its technology and cybersecurity employees reminding them not to ""destroy or delete"" any relevant documents about the breach, as well as about a smaller intrusion one year ago that affected 465,000 customers who used the bank's prepaid cash cards. Companies customarily send out these ""hold"" notices when they receive subpoenas or request for documents from regulators and law enforcement agencies.  "
Iran Hackers Dangle a Familiar Name to Fish for Data,"WASHINGTON -- Over the years, John R. Bolton has played many roles in Washington. He was American ambassador to the United Nations, where he famously suggested the place could lose many of its floors -- and the bureaucrats who worked on them. He was the State Department's combative counterproliferation chief during George W. Bush's first term, and these days he regularly appears on Fox News to denounce the Obama administration as weak and feckless. It turns out he is also the favorite neoconservative of Iranian hackers.  Mr. Bolton said he learned this week that his identity had been stolen by hackers whom a Texas cybersecurity firm identified as a group of Iranians. It is not clear if they were government agents, part of the ''cybercorps'' that Iran organized after American- and Israeli-developed cyberattacks on its nuclear infrastructure, or whether they were ''patriotic hackers.'' But clearly they were in search of information about Washington's elite. In the old days of the Cold War, they would have operated by hanging out at the Occidental Grill or cocktail parties at the French Embassy, hoping to pick up a bit of loose conversation. These days, they did it by faking a LinkedIn account for Mr. Bolton, and gradually engaging in chats with people who believed they were exchanging thoughts with a man who some conservatives hope will run for president. ''I think the Iranians were after me to get all the secrets that the Obama administration has imparted to me about the Iranian nuclear program,'' Mr. Bolton, now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute here, said dryly on Friday. ''I'm honored they picked me,'' he said. ''They must have been looking for the most anti-Iranian regime person in Washington. I'm proud to win that award.'' Mr. Bolton was hardly the only one; a report released this week by iSight Partners, a computer security firm in Dallas, said the attacks compromised the computers of roughly 2,000 users. ''This marks the emergence of Iran on the cyberespionage landscape,'' said John Hultquist, the head of cyberespionage intelligence at iSight. The campaign described by iSight appears to have started in 2011, just months after the discovery of the Stuxnet computer worm, which attacked Iran's nuclear enrichment center at Natanz and destroyed upward of 1,000 centrifuges. Ever since, American intelligence officials have viewed Iran as a growing cyberthreat, even if it has a long way to go to catch up with its Russian and Chinese counterparts. But compared with other cyberattacks, the one aimed at Mr. Bolton -- first reported by Foreign Policy magazine and The Daily Beast -- was amateurish. It was a ''spear-phishing attack,'' an effort to get people to respond to an email or other invitation, in hopes of revealing their passwords or contact lists. Mr. Bolton may have been the target, or he may have been collateral damage in a broader attack on the American Enterprise Institute. Similar attacks have been directed at other think tanks, from the Council on Foreign Relations to the Aspen Institute. In each of those cases, the hackers seemed interested in power brokers, former power brokers, consultants, contractors and journalists, apparently on the theory that those targets have confidential insights into the American government. ''This shows that the Iranians are energetic, and with relatively limited skills they take full advantage of what they can do,'' said James Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''But it doesn't show them entering the big leagues. This is pretty basic level stuff.'' The iSight report did not say what types of data the hackers were able to steal, but the list of targets suggested that hackers may have been after plans for military weapons systems. A fake website used by the group, NewsOnAir.org, was registered in Tehran and sites that hackers used to deploy their malware were hosted in Iran. The malware of the hackers contained several Persian words, and the time stamps of their activity tracked with professional working hours in Tehran. The hackers used a dozen fake personas and connected with victims over Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube. They sent malicious links to their targets; the unlucky victims had malware downloaded on their machines. Among the fake personas employed by the hackers were the names of real journalists. In others, they claimed to be employees at military contractors, a tax adviser and reporters for the fake news organization set up by the hackers. Some experts said it was remarkable that such techniques still work. ''You know, they say that on the Internet no one knows you are a dog,'' said Jason Healey, who runs the Cyber Statecraft program at the Atlantic Council, referring to a famous New Yorker cartoon in which canine computer users are musing on the benefits of their anonymity. ''But there are still a lot of stupid people when it comes to clicking on links.'' "
Court Grants Secrecy for Memo on Phone Data,"WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court on Friday ruled that the Obama administration may continue to withhold a Justice Department memo that apparently opened a loophole in laws protecting the privacy of consumer data. The memo establishes the legal basis for telephone companies to hand over customers' calling records to the government without a subpoena or court order, even when there is no emergency, according to a 2010 report by the Justice Department's inspector general. The details of the legal theory, and the circumstances in which it could be invoked, remain unclear. The ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, came down on the side of a broad conception of the executive branch's power to keep secret its interpretation of what the law permits it to do. The ruling may make it easier for the government to shield other memos by the Justice Department's powerful Office of Legal Counsel from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.  The document at issue is a classified memo issued by the Office of Legal Counsel on Jan. 8, 2010. A report later that year by the Justice Department's inspector general at the time, Glenn A. Fine, disclosed the memo's existence and its broad conclusion that telephone companies may voluntarily provide records to the government ''without legal process or a qualifying emergency,'' notwithstanding the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. The F.B.I. had asked for the memo as part of an investigation by Mr. Fine into problems with the bureau's use of so-called exigent letters to obtain telephone and financial records without following any legal procedures. The bureau, which has abandoned exigent letters, said that it did not employ the legal theory outlined in the memo when using the letters, and that it had no plans to use it in the future. But Mr. Fine warned that the existence of the Office of Legal Counsel's theory created a ''significant gap'' in ''accountability and oversight,'' and urged Congress to modify the statute. Lawmakers have not acted on that recommendation. The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a lawsuit in 2011 seeking to obtain the memo under the Freedom of Information Act. But a District Court judge ruled that the memo fell into an exception to that law covering materials developed when the executive branch is deliberating internally about what policy to select, and a three-judge panel on the appeals court agreed on Friday. The Office of Legal Counsel issues binding legal advice to the executive branch. If it says something is permitted, officials who act on that advice are essentially immune from prosecution. Its power to adopt secret legal theories has come under greater scrutiny since a string of controversial opinions it produced during the Bush administration, including signing off on warrantless wiretapping and on the brutal questioning of detainees. ''Even if the O.L.C. opinion describes the legal parameters of what the F.B.I. is permitted to do, it does not state or determine the F.B.I.'s policy,'' Judge Harry T. Edwards wrote in the decision on Friday. ''The F.B.I. was free to decline to adopt the investigative tactics deemed legally permissible in the O.L.C. opinion.'' As a result, he added, the memo was covered in its entirety by the exception. By the same legal reasoning, nearly any Office of Legal Counsel memo would be exempt from disclosure. ''We are pleased with the decision,'' said Andrew Ames, a Justice Department spokesman. The Electronic Frontier Foundation had argued that because of the special role played by Office of Legal Counsel memos, they amounted to the government's official ''working law'' and should not fall into the category of deliberative materials that are exempt from disclosure. David Sobel, a lawyer for the foundation, called the ruling ''troubling,'' describing the office's memos as a body of ''secret law'' that the public has a right to know about. He said he hoped the ruling would reinvigorate efforts among some lawmakers to enact a law opening such memos to greater scrutiny outside the executive branch. ''It's kind of hard to imagine how a different case in the D.C. Circuit is likely to have a different outcome in light of this opinion,'' he said. Legal specialists said the ruling was in line with how other federal courts, notably the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, have dealt with requests under the Freedom of Information Act for Office of Legal Counsel memos in recent years. During the litigation, the Justice Department also told the court that parts of the memo contained classified information, ''highly specific in nature and known to very few individuals,'' about a secret intelligence-gathering technique that the F.B.I. is using against ''hostile entities.'' The memo was also requested by McClatchy Newspapers, and a Justice Department letter rejecting that request may offer a clue about its contents. It suggested that the memo involves a statute that makes an exception to data privacy laws for ''the acquisition by the United States government of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications.'' That same statutory exception is said to be the legal basis for a recently disclosed C.I.A. program in which AT&T, under a voluntarily contract rather than a subpoena, searches its vast database of international phone records and provides data about calls that may help the agency identify associates of overseas terrorism suspects. Most of those communications are purely foreign, officials have said. But when AT&T analysts identify a potentially relevant call that has one end inside the United States, it partly masks the number on that end. The C.I.A. refers the matter to the F.B.I. for domestic investigation. The bureau still uses so-called national security letters to compel telephone companies to turn over records without a court order. A recent report by a review group appointed by President Obama to review surveillance policy recommended that national security letters be overhauled to require judicial approval. The government's use of bulk calling records has come under greater scrutiny after leaks disclosed that the National Security Agency has been collecting records of every domestic phone call. On Friday, the government announced that the nation's surveillance court had reauthorized that program for an additional 90 days. In recent weeks, two Federal District Court judges have come to opposite conclusions about whether the bulk collection program is lawful. On Thursday and Friday, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Justice Department appealed the rulings. The surveillance review group has also recommended overhauling the program so that the data would remain in the hands of the phone companies and judicial approval would be required for each government search through the records. "
Obama to Place Some Restraints on Surveillance,"WASHINGTON -- President Obama will issue new guidelines on Friday to curtail government surveillance, but will not embrace the most far-reaching proposals of his own advisers and will ask Congress to help decide some of the toughest issues, according to people briefed on his thinking. Mr. Obama plans to increase limits on access to bulk telephone data, call for privacy safeguards for foreigners and propose the creation of a public advocate to represent privacy concerns at a secret intelligence court. But he will not endorse leaving bulk data in the custody of telecommunications firms, nor will he require court permission for all so-called national security letters seeking business records. The emerging approach, described by current and former government officials who insisted on anonymity in advance of Mr. Obama's widely anticipated speech, suggested a president trying to straddle a difficult line in hopes of placating foreign leaders and advocates of civil liberties without a backlash from national security agencies. The result seems to be a speech that leaves in place many current programs, but embraces the spirit of reform and keeps the door open to changes later.  The decision to provide additional privacy protections for non-American citizens or residents, for instance, largely codifies existing practices but will be followed by a 180-day study by the director of national intelligence about whether to go further. Likewise, instead of taking the storage of bulk data out of government hands, as recommended by a review panel he appointed, Mr. Obama will leave it in place for now and ask lawmakers to weigh in. The blend of decisions, to be outlined in a speech at the Justice Department and in a presidential guidelines memorandum, will be Mr. Obama's highest-profile response to the disclosures about the National Security Agency made in recent months by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor who has fled to Russia. But as intelligence officials have sorted through Mr. Obama's evolving position, they have been divided about how significant his adjustments will be. Some officials complained that the changes will add layers of cumbersome procedure that will hinder the hunt for potential terrorists, while others expressed relief that Mr. Obama is not going further and confidence that they could still work within the new guidelines without sacrificing much. ''Is it cosmetic or is there a real thumb on the scale in a different direction?'' asked one former government official who worked on intelligence issues. ''That's the question.'' The White House said the president's review is incomplete and would not comment further Tuesday. The developments came as the nation's judiciary waded into the highly charged debate. In a letter made public on Tuesday, a judge designated by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. to express the views of the judicial branch warned that some changes under consideration would have a negative ''operational impact'' on a secret foreign intelligence court. Judge John D. Bates, a former chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, urged Mr. Obama and Congress not to alter the way the court is appointed or to create an independent public advocate to argue against the Justice Department in secret proceedings. Any such advocate, he wrote, should instead be appointed only when the court decided one was needed. Judge Bates objected to the workload of requiring that courts approve all national security letters, which are administrative subpoenas allowing the F.B.I. to obtain records about communications and financial transactions without court approval. And he raised concerns about greater public disclosure of court rulings, arguing that unclassified summaries would be ''likely to promote confusion and misunderstanding.'' The judge's letter, versions of which he sent to the leaders of several congressional committees, was released as all five members of Mr. Obama's surveillance review group testified Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, seeking support for their recommendations. Illustrating the cross-pressures on the president, the advisers argued for the appointment of the independent version of a public advocate, a recommendation the president is expected to follow, though it is not clear how he will structure the position. ''We admire Judge Bates and respect his views,'' said Cass R. Sunstein, of Harvard Law School and a former Obama White House official who served on the review panel. ''We respectfully disagree with that one, on the ground that the judge sometimes is not in the ideal position to know whether a particular view needs representation and that in our tradition, standardly, the judge doesn't decide whether one or another view gets a lawyer.'' The judge's objection to the proposal on national security letters dovetailed with that of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who argued it would be inefficient to have to go to a judge each time records were sought. Mr. Obama has decided not to require court approval in every case, but might still require it in some circumstances, according to one administration official. Mr. Obama will cut back on the number of people whose phone records can be examined by the N.S.A. through its bulk data program. Currently the agency can scrutinize call records of people as far as three steps, or ''hops,'' removed from a suspect. Mr. Obama's review panel proposed limiting searches to people just two steps removed. He is also likely to cut down the number of years such data can be retained; currently it is deleted after five years. But the president will not, at least for now, back the panel's suggestion that telecommunications firms keep such data and that the government be allowed to tap into those databases only when necessary. Intelligence officials complained it would be inefficient to have to go to multiple companies, so some officials proposed creating an independent consortium to store the data instead. Mr. Obama has decided against keeping the data at the private providers because they do not want that responsibility, officials said, and no independent consortium currently exists. As a result, he will ask Congress to work with him to determine the best way to store the data. He also appears likely to reject the idea of separating code breakers and code makers. Some critics of the N.S.A. were disturbed that the agency's encryption team charged with bolstering online security systems against hackers was working with the team that tries to penetrate computer systems used by terrorists. The letter by Judge Bates was accompanied by 15 pages of often specific comments about possible surveillance reforms. It is highly unusual for judges to weigh in on public policy debates involving the other two branches of government, but Judge Bates, the director of the Administrative Office of the United States Court, said that Chief Justice Roberts had designated him to ''act as a liaison'' and that he had consulted other judges. The judge emphasized that his comments were meant to address smooth operation of the court and were ''not intended as expressions of support or opposition to particular introduced bills.'' Still, his comments went beyond workload issues. He objected to a proposal by Mr. Obama's review group to take away Chief Justice Roberts's sole power to appoint the 11 judges of the surveillance court and have them picked instead by the chief judges of the appeals courts. Ten of the 11 current judges were appointed by Republican presidents, and critics have called for more diversity. ''The chief justice is uniquely positioned to select qualified judges,'' Judge Bates argued. "
Ann Cavoukian,"Kate Murphy is a journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times. Ann Cavoukian is the information and privacy commissioner in Ontario, Canada, and a longtime advocate of default online confidentiality. Her concept of ''privacy by design,'' which was developed in the 1990s and encourages embedding privacy protections in information technology and business practices, has recently gained renewed attention and proclamations of support from regulatory agencies worldwide.  READING I've been delving into Viktor Mayer-Schönberger and Kenneth Cukier's new book, ''Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work and Think.'' It's about how with the enormous wealth of data we have, we can bring great new insights. What I didn't like were the comments about how we can't simultaneously protect privacy. That's nonsense. It's all in the design of systems. Use the data by all means, but aggregate it and de-identify it. LISTENING I enjoy a variety of classical music. Beethoven is my personal favorite but I also love Chopin and Erik Satie. And I love Moby because I love to dance. I like to bop around the house but also love folk dancing and ballet. I'm Armenian, that's my background, and there are beautiful Armenian folk dances. The movement is so flowing and free and gorgeous, so I am really attracted to that. WATCHING I love ''Homeland,'' ''Person of Interest'' and ''Hostages.'' I find it fascinating, the shadow world, what we don't know. Maybe it's my line of work and also because my two grandmothers survived the Armenian genocide in 1915. On the inside of my grandmothers' forearms, they had six-digit numbers that identified them in the camps. They managed to escape. For them it was all about freedom. Privacy and freedom go hand in hand. Historians will tell you the first thread to unravel when a free and democratic society morphs into a totalitarian state is privacy. FOLLOWING The International Association of Privacy Professionals, or I.A.P.P., has a daily dashboard of the top news stories that relate to privacy, and the Privacy Forum Blog by Lauren Weinstein is fabulous. Jules Polonetsky in Washington, D.C., runs the Future of Privacy Forum, which is also something I look at. PAINTING I love to paint and I'll tell you, I'm not bad. I use one of my paintings for my annual Christmas card, and this year's card is a painting based on a photograph I took in Rome. "
A Second Front in the Privacy Wars,"More than a year before Edward Snowden exposed the vast reach of government surveillance, President Obama proposed a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights to protect Americans from the prying eyes of Internet companies, advertisers and other businesses. In a February 2012 report, his administration offered a well-reasoned argument for giving consumers more control over how much and what kind of data companies can collect about them and what businesses can do with that information. ''American consumers can't wait any longer for clear rules of the road that ensure their personal information is safe online,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement at the time. But few members of Congress expressed interest in his proposal and the administration did not push it aggressively, which is why the bill of rights idea faded into obscurity -- until now.  Last month, Mr. Obama tapped his special adviser, John Podesta, to take another look at privacy and big data (the millions of records that businesses are collecting and using to increase sales and improve operations) and produce a fresh report in 90 days. With the Internet evolving fast, few consumers can adequately guard against losing control of their personal data. A recent report by the majority staff of the Senate Commerce Committee, for example, found that companies known as data brokers have assembled extensive dossiers on millions of individuals and families. Those files include information like web browsing histories, what consumers bought in physical and online stores, and what medical conditions people have. Data brokers organize and sell that information to retailers, lenders and other businesses that pitch their products to people grouped in categories like ''rural and barely making it'' and ''ethnic second-city strugglers.'' Some of the information is highly personal, if clearly irrelevant to any marketing campaign. A Chicago-area man recently received a marketing offer from OfficeMax that included the line ''Daughter Killed in Car Crash'' between his name and address, a reference to an accident that took place a year earlier. The company says that the phrase was included in error, but it offers a clue into the kind of data being collected. The Senate report also notes that hackers and identity thieves have stolen or even purchased information from data brokers. While businesses have a legitimate need for customer information and want new ways to market what they have to offer, they need to operate transparently. And no less important, consumers should have the ability to protect information they consider sensitive. A Pew Research survey released last September reported that a majority of Americans worry about their privacy. About 86 percent said they took some steps to ''remove or mask their digital footprints'' when they were online. But these efforts are often insufficient because companies have multiple ways to monitor people, some of which are very hard to evade. And 68 percent believed current laws are not strong enough to protect them. The technology and advertising industries have argued that self-regulation is the best approach to dealing with such concerns. But industry efforts have failed to produce easy-to-use protections. That's why it is important that the president's latest initiative not produce another report that goes nowhere. The president and the public need from Mr. Podesta and his team not only a thorough description of how businesses are collecting private data but also specific legislative proposals to give consumers more control of that information. "
'The Wild West of Privacy',"We are fast approaching a privacy crisis in the United States. Google, Facebook and other big Internet companies collect information about us, which they deploy in the service of advertisers. Big data brokers, like Acxiom, have developed sophisticated tools that allow them to know almost as much about us as we know about ourselves; they then sell that data to all kinds of companies that want to learn everything from our habits to our health, from our sexual orientation to our finances. The digital age has made it easy to collect medical data, which is supposed to be protected under federal law. Huge data breaches at big retailers like Target have made it seem unsafe to use credit cards. And I haven't even mentioned the Edward Snowden revelations about the massive data collection by the National Security Agency. ''The United States,'' says Barry Steinhardt, the founder of Friends of Privacy USA, ''is basically the Wild West of privacy.''  As The Times noted in an editorial on Monday, it was two years ago that the Obama administration issued a report calling for a consumer privacy bill of rights. Although the report went nowhere, it was full of sound, broad principles: ''a sensible framework that would help establish fairness and accountability for the collection and use of personal information,'' as a group of privacy advocates put it in a letter they sent to the president on Monday. The advocates called on President Obama to work with Congress to finally pass privacy legislation. In that spirit, I thought it would be a useful exercise to call some privacy experts and ask them what should be in such a bill. Here's what they had to say. REGULATE DATA BROKERS Almost everyone I spoke to saw data brokers as a far bigger threat to privacy than, say, Facebook. These are companies that collect a hundred different data points, both off-line and online, and create scores and profiles that they sell to anyone who wants to buy them. At a minimum, people should know what information of theirs is being compiled. Better yet, people should have a right to control what information of theirs gets sold and what remains private. OPT-IN INSTEAD OF OPT-OUT The typical terms of agreement that we check when we want to use the services of an Internet company invariably gives the company the right to redeploy our information for their own benefit. Some companies also give consumers the right to opt-out of that information-gathering, but it is usually a process that requires some effort. A far better approach would have customers opting in instead of opting out. This would also likely force companies to explain to their customers why they need the data and what they will use it for, which is another thing that should be included in any privacy bill. GIVE COMPANIES AN INCENTIVE TO PREVENT DATA BREACHES One reason breaches like the recent Target disaster have taken place is that they bring with them very little consequence. But it would be easy enough to create consequences -- a data breach could be treated like an oil spill, with fines attached. The government could also make it easier for people to sue. Lee Tien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation also says that companies should be doing far more encrypting than they do now. Privacy legislation could give them a push in that direction. NO MORE SECRETS It's not just data brokers that need to be more transparent. It is every entity that collects data. People should be able to see the information that is collected on them. For instance, there are companies that compile scores about people -- risk scores, or health scores, or fraud scores. Those scores should be known to the people who are being scored because it can affect everything from their ability to get insurance to their chances of landing a job. ''You should have the right to know what information is being collected about you, who has access to it, how it is being used, and to limit that use,'' says Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''And if companies violate those rights, there should be consequences.'' In 1967, Senator William Proxmire, who would later serve as the head of the Senate Banking Committee, pushed through the Truth in Lending Act in the face of fierce opposition from the credit card industry. It was, however, the best thing that ever happened to the industry because it showed consumers, for the first time, that they had some protection from fraud or shady practices. In some ways, it is the same now with privacy. As much as the companies like Google and Facebook and Acxiom would oppose privacy legislation, they need it -- for their sake as well as ours. Sometimes, government has to save business from itself. "
Ordering Google to Forget,"In a ruling that could undermine press freedoms and free speech, the highest court of the European Union said on Tuesday that Google must comply with requests from individuals to remove links on search results pages to newspaper articles and other web pages that might cause embarrassment.  The European Court of Justice ruled that an individual's ''right to be forgotten'' was so strong that Google and other Internet search companies could be forced to remove links even if the information in question was itself accurate and lawful. The court said links could be removed if they were found to be ''inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant.'' But the ruling provided little guidance to lower courts about how to decide when links should be removed. As a result, it could open the floodgates for people living in the 28 countries of the European Union to demand that Google and other search engines remove millions of links from search results. Such a purge would leave Europeans less well informed and make it harder for journalists and dissidents to have their voices heard. The ruling was based on a case brought by a Spanish man against a newspaper and Google. He argued that searching for his name led to two pages originally published in 1998 on the website of the newspaper, La Vanguardia, about his debts and the forced sale of his home. The Spanish Data Protection Agency did not require the newspaper to take down the pages, but it ordered Google to remove links to them. Google appealed that decision and the National High Court of Spain sought advice from the European court. The case now goes back to the Spanish court for resolution. In 1995, the European Union issued a directive to its members to protect the privacy of individuals. The directive did not explicitly establish a right to be forgotten. But the European court ruled that ''after a certain time'' individuals can argue that search links no longer comply with the directive and should be erased. The court, however, did not specify how much time has to pass for a request to be considered valid, presumably, leaving that question to Internet companies, privacy officials in European countries and lower courts to answer on a case-by-case basis. European lawmakers and courts have a long history of protecting privacy. In March, the European Parliament approved a new data protection law that, among other things, includes an explicit right to be forgotten. European governments still need to sign off on that legislation before it can be finalized. The desire to allow individuals to erase data that they no longer wish to disclose is understandable. For example, there are good reasons to let people remove embarrassing photos and posts they published on social media as children or young adults. But lawmakers should not create a right so powerful that it could limit press freedoms or allow individuals to demand that lawful information in a news archive be hidden. "
Technology Companies Are Pressing Congress to Bolster Privacy Protections,"WASHINGTON -- A law that allows the government to read email and cloud-stored data over six months old without a search warrant is under attack from technology companies, trade associations and lobbying groups, which are pressing Congress to tighten privacy protections. Federal investigators have used the law to view content hosted by third-party providers for civil and criminal lawsuits, in some cases without giving notice to the individual being investigated. Nearly 30 years after Congress passed the law, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which government officials have interpreted to cover newer technologies, cloud computing companies are scrambling to reassure their customers, and some clients are taking their business to other countries. Ben Young, the general counsel for Peer 1, a web hosting company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, said his customers were keeping their business out of the United States because the country ''has a serious branding problem.''  ''We've enjoyed a competitive advantage in Canada,'' he said, ''because the public perception in the business community is that American law enforcement has more access to data than in other parts of the world.'' Places such as Germany, Iceland and Switzerland are trading on a reputation of stronger protections for companies, but such safeguards are not universally tighter than those in the United States. ''Some countries are stricter on privacy, and some of them are not,'' said Mark Jaycox, a legislative analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a technology advocacy group. Privacy has been an increasing concern since Edward J. Snowden's revelations last year about bulk data collection by the National Security Agency, but an overhaul of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act has failed to break into the national conversation. ''Because it's not sexy,'' said Katie McAuliffe, the executive director for digital liberty at Americans for Tax Reform. The United States' image problem has caused ''real, tangible harm'' for businesses, said Christian Dawson, the chief operating officer at ServInt, a web hosting company based in Reston, Va. ''It's very easy for providers outside the country to say, 'Hey, move your business offshore into an area that cares more about your privacy.' They don't have better laws necessarily. They have a better marketing department.'' Silicon Valley giants like Facebook, Twitter and Google say they will no longer hand over their customers' data without a search warrant. But smaller web hosting and cloud computing companies may be outmuscled by law enforcement officials as they try to protect their customers, said Ron Yokubaitis, the co-chief executive of Data Foundry, a data center company based in Texas. ''Mostly, they are going to comply because they don't know their rights or can't spend the money to resist,'' he said. A coalition of technology companies, trade associations and lobbying groups, called Digital Due Process, is pushing Congress to bolster privacy rules. Bipartisan bills in the House and the Senate have brought together a hodgepodge of supporters, including liberals and Tea Party favorites. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, co-sponsored the Senate bill. He said in a recent interview that ''like most Americans,'' he was shocked to find that the 1986 statute was on the books. ''Almost every American thinks that it is frightening that we have a law that suggests that the government has the right to read your email after only 180 days,'' Mr. Lee said. ''It's an easy issue in which to achieve bipartisan compromise and consensus.'' The bill would require a search warrant for access to electronic communications, with exceptions for some emergency situations. It would also require the government to notify individuals within 10 days that their information was being investigated. However, it does not address rules for location data, like GPS information from an individual's cellphone. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill a year ago, but it has since stalled. One reason is resistance from federal investigating agencies that use subpoenas to gain access to electronic communications in civil cases, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''The S.E.C. cannot get a search warrant, so a bill that requires a warrant to obtain emails from an I.S.P. would undermine the S.E.C.'s ability to protect American investors and hold wrongdoers accountable,'' said Andrew Ceresney, the director of the Division of Enforcement at the S.E.C., referring to Internet service providers. Instead, the S.E.C. would have to rely on an individual's voluntary disclosure of digital content. But some legal experts, and at least one appeals court, do not find that argument compelling. ''The courts say that email on a server somewhere is like email in your virtual home,'' said Orin S. Kerr, a professor at George Washington University Law School. ''We wouldn't say the S.E.C. should have the power to tell your landlord to break into your apartment and get evidence. The same rule should apply.'' The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, ruled in 2010 that part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act was unconstitutional. Since the decision, most major technology companies have required a search warrant for customers' content. ''They are an administrative agency that is holding up this process because they are demanding unconstitutional new powers,'' said Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, referring to the S.E.C. Texas has taken the matter into its own hands. Last summer, Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, signed a bill that will force law enforcement officials to obtain a warrant to view any electronic communications in the state, essentially the same measure that waits on Capitol Hill. But the S.E.C. has indicated that it is open to negotiations. The agency's chairwoman, Mary Jo White, ''supports a number of other ways to address privacy interests and still allow the S.E.C. and other civil law enforcement agencies to gather critical email evidence from ISPs,'' Mr. Ceresney said. Representative Kevin Yoder, Republican of Kansas and a co-sponsor of the House bill, said that provisions of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act were ''frankly much worse'' than the N.S.A.'s domestic surveillance program. While the N.S.A. program involves the collection of phone-calling information known as metadata, the privacy act allows law enforcement officials to actually read emails, ''and in many cases Americans don't know it's happening to them,'' Mr. Yoder said. For cloud computing companies, something is better than nothing when it comes to changes to the law. ''We need a meaningful response from the government,'' Mr. Young of Peer 1 said. ''It doesn't have to be sweeping, and it doesn't have to fix everything overnight. The United States' status as a leader in Internet innovation is being seriously threatened.'' Mr. Dawson of ServInt just expanded the company's operations to Amsterdam, and he said the firm was more likely to grow there, ''which is a shame.'' "
"Justices, 9-0, Rule Cellphone Search Needs a Warrant","WASHINGTON -- In a sweeping victory for privacy rights in the digital age, the Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously ruled that the police need warrants to search the cellphones of people they arrest. While the decision will offer protection to the 12 million people arrested every year, many for minor crimes, its impact will most likely be much broader. The ruling almost certainly also applies to searches of tablet and laptop computers, and its reasoning may apply to searches of homes and businesses and of information held by third parties like phone companies. ''This is a bold opinion,'' said Orin S. Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University. ''It is the first computer-search case, and it says we are in a new digital age. You can't apply the old rules anymore.'' Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the court, was keenly alert to the central role that cellphones play in contemporary life. They are, he said, ''such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy.''  But he added that old principles required that their contents be protected from routine searches. One of the driving forces behind the American Revolution, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, was revulsion against ''general warrants,'' which ''allowed British officers to rummage through homes in an unrestrained search for evidence of criminal activity.'' ''The fact that technology now allows an individual to carry such information in his hand,'' the chief justice also wrote, ''does not make the information any less worthy of the protection for which the founders fought.'' The government has been on a surprising losing streak in cases involving the use of new technologies by the police. In Wednesday's case and in a 2012 decision concerning GPS devices, the Supreme Court's precedents had supported the government. ''But the government got zero votes in those two cases,'' Professor Kerr said. The courts have long allowed warrantless searches in connection with arrests, saying they are justified by the need to protect police officers and to prevent the destruction of evidence. But Chief Justice Roberts said neither justification made much sense in the context of cellphones. While the police may examine a cellphone to see if it contains, say, a razor blade, he wrote, ''once an officer has secured a phone and eliminated any potential physical threats, however, data on the phone can endanger no one.'' The possibility that evidence could be destroyed or hidden by ''remote wiping'' or encryption programs, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, was remote, speculative and capable of being addressed. The police may turn off a phone, remove its battery or place it in a bag made of aluminum foil. Should the police confront an authentic ''now or never'' situation, the chief justice wrote, they may well be entitled to search the phone under a separate strand of Fourth Amendment law, one concerning ''exigent circumstances.'' On the other side of the balance, Chief Justice Roberts said, is the data contained on typical cellphones. Ninety percent of Americans have them, he wrote, and they contain ''a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives -- from the mundane to the intimate.'' He wrote, ''According to one poll, nearly three-quarters of smartphone users report being within five feet of their phones most of the time, with 12 percent admitting that they even use their phones in the shower.'' Even the word cellphone is a misnomer, he said. ''They could just as easily be called cameras, video players, Rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps or newspapers,'' he wrote. Chief Justice Roberts acknowledged that the decision would make law enforcement more difficult. ''Cellphones have become important tools in facilitating coordination and communication among members of criminal enterprises, and can provide valuable incriminating information about dangerous criminals,'' he wrote. ''Privacy comes at a cost.'' But other technologies, he said, can make it easier for the police to obtain warrants. Using email and iPads, the chief justice wrote, officers can sometimes have a warrant in hand in 15 minutes. Ellen Canale, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said the department would work with its law enforcement agencies to ensure full compliance with the decision. The Supreme Court is occasionally criticized for its lack of technological savvy, but Chief Justice Roberts, 59, seemed fully familiar with what smartphones can do. ''The average smartphone user has installed 33 apps,'' he wrote, ''which together can form a revealing montage of the user's life.'' There are mobile applications, he said, for ''Democratic Party news and Republican Party news,'' for ''alcohol, drug and gambling addictions,'' for ''sharing prayer requests'' and for ''tracking pregnancy symptoms.'' Records from those applications, he added, ''may be accessible on the phone indefinitely.'' And yet more information, he said, may be available through cloud computing. ''An Internet search and browsing history,'' he wrote, ''can be found on an Internet-enabled phone and could reveal an individual's private interests or concerns -- perhaps a search for certain symptoms of disease, coupled with frequent visits to WebMD. Data on a cellphone can also reveal where a person has been. Historic location information is a standard feature on many smartphones and can reconstruct someone's specific movements down to the minute, not only around town but also within a particular building.'' The court heard arguments in April in two cases on the issue, but issued a single decision. The first case, Riley v. California, No. 13-132, arose from the arrest of David L. Riley, who was pulled over in San Diego in 2009 for having an expired auto registration. The police found loaded guns in his car and, on inspecting his smartphone, entries they associated with a street gang. A more comprehensive search of the phone led to information that linked Mr. Riley to a shooting. He was later convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. A California appeals court said neither search had required a warrant. The second case, United States v. Wurie, No. 13-212, involved a search of the call log of the flip phone of Brima Wurie, who was arrested in 2007 in Boston and charged with gun and drug crimes. Last year, the federal appeals court in Boston threw out the evidence found on Mr. Wurie's phone. News organizations, including The New York Times, filed a brief supporting Mr. Riley and Mr. Wurie in which they argued that cellphone searches can compromise news gathering. The Justice Department, in its Supreme Court briefs, said cellphones were not materially different from wallets, purses and address books. Chief Justice Roberts disagreed. ''That is like saying a ride on horseback is materially indistinguishable from a flight to the moon,'' he wrote. Jeffrey L. Fisher, a lawyer for Mr. Riley, said the decision was a landmark. ''The decision brings the Fourth Amendment into the 21st century,'' he said. ''The core of the decision is that digital information is different. It triggers privacy concerns far more profound than ordinary physical objects.'' The Supreme Court's decisions can be technical. This one was straightforward. What must the police do when they want to search a cellphone in connection with an arrest? ''Get a warrant,'' Chief Justice Roberts wrote. "
Facebook Leads in Links Erased by Google in E.U.,"LONDON -- Facebook, and Google's own services, are among the websites to be most affected by Europe's so-called right to be forgotten, according to figures Google released on Thursday. As part of an update to its online transparency report, Google said that it had removed more links to content on Facebook from its search results than from any other site, in response to people's requests to have links to material expunged to protect their privacy. Two of Google's services -- YouTube and the online forum Google Groups -- were also among the products most affected by such requests.  The links are being removed in response to a European privacy ruling that allows people to ask that links to information about themselves be removed from online searches unless a compelling public-interest reason exists for retaining the material. Since the European Union's highest court handed down its privacy decision in May, more than 3,300 links to material on Facebook have been removed. That is 1.9 percent of the 169,500 links to websites that Google has removed from its search results, according to a report by the company on Thursday. Facebook declined to comment on the report. A combined 4,300 links to Google's YouTube and Groups services also have been removed, or about 2.5 percent of all the links erased. Profile Engine, a social network based in New Zealand, and Badoo, an online dating service, were among the websites with the largest number of links removed, Google's report said. The New York Times and other media organizations have also been notified that links to articles have been removed from some Google search results. The privacy ruling has pitted freedom of speech advocates like Jimmy Wales, a founder of Wikipedia, against consumer advocates who argue that individuals should have the right to seek removal of links to online information about themselves. Unlike in the United States, where the First Amendment protects freedom of speech above privacy rights, Europe places almost equal weight on people's privacy and freedom of expression. Google's report offers snippets of insight about the decisions its team of legal experts has made while processing the approximately 143,000 requests, related to 491,000 links, that the company has received in the last five months. Examples given in the report of the requests, which remain anonymous in compliance with European data protection rules, include a Swiss financial services professional who asked that links to 10 web pages outlining his conviction for financial crimes be removed. Google said it had denied the request. Another request relates to a rape victim in Germany who asked that a link to an article about the crime be removed. Google said it had taken down the link. While the decision in those cases would seem clear cut -- there is a clear public interest in publishing information about a business professional's financial crimes, but not in the case of a rape victim -- others are more ambiguous. These other requests include a British man who successfully asked that links to a newspaper report about his guilty plea at a local court be removed. Google said it had taken down the links, which relate to factually accurate information, because British law requires that information about convictions should not be held against individuals after a certain period of time. The search engine's transparency report also provides updated figures about which European countries have submitted the most privacy requests. The right-to-be-forgotten decision allows anyone based in Europe -- and potentially those elsewhere -- to submit requests to Google. If their submissions are successful, the links will not appear in search results on the company's services with European domains, but they will remain open to search on global sites like Google.com. People in France have made roughly 28,500 requests, the largest number of any European country, according to Google's report. Individuals in Germany and Britain, two of Europe's most populous countries, submitted the second- and third-largest numbers of requests. Some countries have more successful requests than others. In Italy, for example, about three-quarters of the submissions have been rejected, according to the report. By contrast, more than half of the submissions from Germany so far have been approved. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Oops! Health Insurer Exposes Member Data,"Earlier this year, OfficeMax became a little too personal with one customer, sending a mailing to a man in Chicago with a street address that, after his own name, inadvertently included information about a family tragedy: ""daughter killed in car crash or Current Business."" (An OfficeMax spokesman later blamed a third-party data broker the company had hired for exposure of the intimate information.) On Monday, in a similar error, some California residents received emails from their health insurer, Anthem Blue Cross, with personal details about them contained in the subject line.  The text of the emails encouraged members to visit their doctors for checkups and to discuss certain medical screening tests. ""Routine checkups and preventive screenings can help you live a healthy life,"" it said. But the emails' subject lines included member-specific demographic details like age range and language. They also listed possible medical screening tests - marked ""Y"" for recommended tests and ""N"" for tests not listed in the email. One woman in California, for example, received an email with the following subject line:  Don't miss out - call your doctor today; PlanState: CA; Segment: Individual; Age: Female Older; Language: EN; CervCancer3yr: N; CervCancer5yr: Y; Mammogram: N; Colonoscopy: N  ""This information is certainly sensitive, as you can imagine, because a call for certain tests, and frequency, could indicate a health problem,"" the woman who received that email wrote in a message to a reporter. Kristin Binns, a spokeswoman for Anthem Blue Cross, said the company was looking into the matter. Anthem Blue Cross is the trade name for Blue Cross of California. The email problem comes at a time when many medical institutions around the country are moving to more secure forms of communication when handling users' health information. Many hospitals, for instance, have set up online portals where people can log on to see personalized health-related messages and screening recommendations - rather than hospitals' sending that information directly to personal email addresses. ""Hospitals have moved away from using ordinary email because there are all sorts of ways in which it can be compromised, intercepted in transit, or seen by your email provider,"" said Jonathan Mayer, a computer scientist and lawyer at Stanford who specializes in data security and privacy. He added, ""It's especially bad when the information is in the subject line because who knows where that could pop up - on a desktop, a phone."" California has a law requiring businesses to notify California residents, within a reasonable time period, if their unencrypted personal information - including medical history, mental or physical condition, medical treatment or diagnosis by a health care professional - might have been involved in a security breach. It is the first state to enact such a data breach notification law. It is unclear whether the emails sent on Monday will require a breach notification. In 2012, Anthem Blue Cross agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by Kamala D. Harris, the California attorney general. The complaint charged that the company had failed to protect the personal information of plan members by sending letters to 33,000 people with their Social Security numbers visible through the envelope. As part of the settlement, the company agreed to put in new technical safeguards for its data management system and improve data security training for employees. In 2013, Anthem Blue Cross sent data breach notices to an undisclosed number of doctors informing them that their names, Social Security numbers and business addresses had been ""erroneously displayed"" in a document posted on the company's website. David Beltran, a spokesman for Ms. Harris, declined to comment on the emails the company sent with member information contained in the subject lines.                       "
Europe's Privacy Regulators Want Google to Broaden the 'Right to Be Forgotten',"LONDON -- Europe is taking aim at Google, again. Privacy watchdogs in the European Union issued guidelines on Wednesday calling on the company to apply the recent ''right to be forgotten'' ruling to Google's entire search empire. Right now, the right to be forgotten ruling -- which created a process for people to remove links to unwanted content from Google's search results -- applies only to Google's local European sites from Google, like Google.de in Germany and other search engines. But the law is easy to get around, because to get the full list of search results all anyone has to do is perform a search on Google's other sites, like Google.com.  The new guidelines, issued by a European body composed of the region's 28 national privacy regulators, aim to firm the law up by requiring Google and other search engines to take down links on sites outside the region as well. ''Under E.U. law, everyone has a right to data protection,'' the regulatory body said in a statement on Wednesday. ''Decisions must be implemented in such a way that they guarantee the effective and complete protection of data subjects' rights and that E.U. law cannot be circumvented.'' On Wednesday, a Google spokesman said that the company had yet to review Europe's new privacy guidelines -- they will not be officially published until Friday -- but that the company would study them carefully when they were published. For now, the decision to expand the scope of the ''right to be forgotten'' is mostly just for show. The guidelines are not binding, and it will be up to E.U. member countries to deicide how to apply them -- or if they want to apply them at all. On top of that, regulators did not clarify whether the guidelines would apply only to requests made by residents of the European Union, or if people in other countries could use the E.U. ruling to make requests for links to be removed. And even if they did, it is not clear how the ruling would be enforced beyond the 28-member European Union, and whether American tech companies would even have to comply. ''This is a line that U.S. companies will be very reluctant to cross,'' said Ian Brown, a professor of information security and privacy at the University of Oxford, in discussing the potential global use of Europe's privacy ruling. ''It will come down to who blinks first. The companies or the privacy regulators.'' Regulators acknowledged as much on Wednesday, saying they would initially concentrate on ''right to be forgotten'' cases that have clear links to the region's residents. Regulators ''will focus on claims where there is a clear link between the data subject and the E.U., for instance where the data subject is a citizen or resident of an E.U. member state,'' the European privacy body said. Despite these difficulties, the decision to expand the scope of the ''right to be forgotten'' decision to potentially all search results is a blow to Google's efforts to contain its European problems. The company is already the target of an extensive European antitrust investigation into its search business in the region and will face a resolution in the European Parliament on Thursday that is expected to call for the company's breakup. The tech company has also faced a series of global privacy challenges this year aimed at forcing it to comply with data protection rulings across all of its search operations. This year, for example, a court in British Columbia ordered Google to remove specific results from its worldwide domains related to an intellectual property dispute in Canada. Google is appealing the decision. And a French court said in September that Google must remove defamatory articles from its global search results about a local lawyer in a case based on the recent ''right to be forgotten'' decision. The ''right to be forgotten'' ruling has become a major sticking point between privacy advocates, who believe individuals have the right to ask that links be removed, and campaigners for freedom of expression, who have stressed that the legal decision unjustly limits what can be published online. Since the ruling in May, Google -- which holds close to 85 percent of Europe's online search market -- has received roughly 175,000 requests, from people in Europe and outside the region, to remove links to online material, according to the company's transparency report. As part of the privacy decision, individuals -- whether based in Europe or outside the region -- must submit requests to search engines with links to the content that they want removed. Submissions must show that the online information is either out of date or no longer relevant, and that there is not a public interest to keep links to the content. Google has agreed so far to about 42 percent of the requests, according to the company's own records. And if people are not satisfied with a search company's initial decision, they can refer their submissions to national data regulators, which will make a final ruling. ''The amount of submissions shows that this legal ruling is a success story for Europe's privacy regulators,'' said Richard Cumbley, a privacy lawyer at Linklaters in London. ''Right to be forgotten doesn't show signs of being forgotten anytime soon."" "
Where Tech Giants Protect Privacy,"The European technology correspondent for The New York Times. LONDON -- FROM their glass-fronted office parks and start-up lofts in Silicon Valley, American tech companies oversee ever-expanding global empires. Google has a bigger slice of the online search market in Europe than it does at home, where rivals like Microsoft still give it a run for its money. More than 80 percent of Facebook's 1.3 billion users live outside the United States, with Brazil and India among the social network's most important markets. And Apple, which generates roughly 60 percent of its revenue overseas, now sells more iPhones and iPads in Shanghai and St. Petersburg than it does in San Diego.    The world's seemingly insatiable appetite for all things tech has made many of these giants among the most profitable companies in the world. But selling these products has also placed them largely at odds with global privacy rules that go far beyond what American lawmakers currently demand at home.     While the tech companies often rely on lengthy (frequently incomprehensible) consent forms and First Amendment rights to protect themselves against claims of misuse of their users' online information, that defense does not hold up in large parts of the world, including Malaysia, South Africa, Brazil, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Argentina.   That's because the right to privacy -- given almost the same weight as freedom of expression -- is taken more seriously abroad, notably in Europe, where politicians are considering rules that would fine any company up to $125 million or 5 percent of its annual revenue if it flouted the region's strict data protection rules.   And as people from Paraguay to the Philippines clamor for greater control over their postings on social networks, in online forums and across the Internet, many of these countries' regulators are taking a page out of Europe's privacy playbook. That includes lifting passages -- almost word for word -- from the region's tough privacy regulations when writing their own national laws.    ''Europe's data protection rules have become the default privacy settings for the world,'' said Billy Hawkes, the former data protection regulator for Ireland, whose role included policing the handling of online data of international users for companies with overseas operations run from Dublin like LinkedIn, Twitter and Dropbox. ''People around the world are benefiting from the standards we've set here.''   Faced with the growing need to cater to a global audience -- and to contend with international regulators who have put privacy front and center -- American companies are being forced to comply with stricter protection standards that are frequently more onerous than those at home.   Facebook, for example, has repeatedly rewritten its privacy policies to give its global users a greater say in how their online data is used. Lawmakers and individuals in Europe -- where all of its non-American customers are regulated -- protested that the company routinely broke the region's privacy rules when handling people's personal information.   ''Facebook just took its U.S. privacy policy and rolled it out in Europe,'' said Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who has filed a class-action lawsuit against the social network involving more than 25,000 users for violating the region's data protection laws when it sent individuals' personal data to the United States, where domestic intelligence agencies could gain access to the information. ''They never wanted to adapt their privacy rules to anywhere outside America.''    Microsoft claims that its cloud computing services (which allow people to store documents and photos on the Internet) now comply with Europe's tough data protection rules -- the only American company so far to receive such approval.   Google, meanwhile, is scrambling to comply with a recent European court ruling that allows anyone -- whether in or out of the 28-member European Union -- to ask that links to online information about themselves be removed from its global search results.    Although Google fought hard to block this so-called right to be forgotten, it lost the battle, and has scrubbed thousands of links from its search results to adhere to the European ruling. Advocates for the new standard are hoping to force the company to extend the practice across its entire global search business -- and potentially to the United States.   ''Americans really do care about these issues,'' said Gus Hosein, a senior fellow at Privacy International, a London-based consumer advocacy group that campaigns for tougher privacy laws. ''But right now, they have very limited rights that they can exert over how their data is used.''    For their part, Google and Facebook maintain that they follow the privacy standards wherever their users are, and that people can opt out of online advertising or delete online profiles if they want to stop using the companies' services.   Across the globe, countries are looking toward Europe for cues on how best to protect their citizens' privacy.    When Brazil recently unveiled the country's new Internet bill of rights, for example, lawmakers demanded that tech companies obtain permission from users before sharing their data with online advertisers and marketers.    New rules in South Africa forbid sending people's online information electronically to countries that do not replicate its stringent privacy laws, though the law has yet to be tested on whether data can be sent to the United States.   In South Korea, lawmakers also have created some of the world's toughest data protection rules, giving people the right to access their online information held by tech companies whenever they want.   And while the United States does have some privacy rules related to minors, health care records and consumer protection, more than 90 percent of Americans say they have now lost control over how companies collect and use their online data, according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center.   So for tech giants like Google and Facebook, the writing is on the wall. These companies may call Silicon Valley home, but they're increasingly falling in step with international regulators.    "
"In Advertising, It's About Who Gets Credit for the Sale","It is the perennial mystery of advertising: Of the many messages that bombard us every day, which ones actually prompt us to get up and buy something? If you're doing a Google search, seeing the connection is often easy - you click on the ad in the search results, go to the retailer's web page and buy something. But for most websites and mobile applications, tracing the path between ad to sale is much more complicated. Advertisers don't want to waste money on ads that fall flat, and popular platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Yahoo want to prove that ads on their sites  actually do lead to sales. So an entire sub-industry has emerged in the ad world to study consumer purchases and figure out which ads should get credit, or attribution, for the sales.   With their services in high demand, the attribution companies are a rare bright spot in an otherwise brutally competitive market among companies that provide the technical services for digital advertising. This week, Oracle, a giant database and cloud software company, showed just how important attribution services have become: It agreed to buy Datalogix, one of the leading players in the attribution, for what the analyst Brian Wieser estimated was in the high hundreds of millions of dollars. (Neither Oracle nor Datalogix would disclose the deal terms.) ""The bulk of marketers, especially performance-based marketers, want to feel increasingly confident in the choices they make,"" said Mr. Wieser, an advertising industry analyst with Pivotal Research. Even though you've probably never heard of Datalogix, it's almost certainly heard of you. It buys purchase data from supermarket loyalty cards and other retail channels and also tracks what people do online. That data is vital to digital platforms, particularly Facebook and Twitter, which are trying to prove to marketers that ads on their services lead to sales in the store. Using a complex system that anonymously matches Datalogix's profiles with Facebook or Twitter IDs and aggregates that data, the social networks can show that, say, a three-month ad campaign on Facebook for MegaRed krill oil actually prompted more people to buy the health supplement. How Datalogix does the matching is a bit of a black box, but brands and publishers believe that it works, with Datalogix boasting about 650 customers. The company's biggest competitor, a partnership between Nielsen and Catalina Marketing, is more oriented towards measuring the impact of television ads on purchases, while Datalogix is more focused on digital platforms, according to Mr. Wieser. One risk is that Datalogix doesn't own most of its data. Privacy is also a big issue. In a major report earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission expressed concerns that data brokers like Datalogix were collecting reams of consumer data without fair disclosure and the agency urged Congress to pass legislation to give consumers the right to see their files and the ability to opt out of marketing related to those files.  Oracle has been building up a suite of digital marketing tools through acquisitions as it diversifies from its roots as a corporate database vendor. Although the company declined to discuss how Datalogix fits in until the deal closes, Mr. Wieser said Datalogix will bolster Oracle's offerings to marketers, solidifying it as the No. 2 player behind Adobe. He said he expects Oracle to make more ad-related acquisitions. ""Oracle knows there's a there there,""  Mr. Wieser said. ""There are almost certainly trillions of dollars of marketing dollars that could be improved with the application of technology.""  "
Is There Any Escape From 'Recommended for You'?," Based on what The New York Times thinks I'm interested in reading, I am not a fun person. ""Recommended for You,"" which tracks readers' habits and predicts their interests, finds me especially interested in the troubles of Gov. Chris Christie, conflicts in the Middle East, the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman and news about technology companies. I might like to believe that I'm more interested in pop music, art exhibits, books and relationships, but - in a ""past is prologue"" sort of way - The Times knows better. The ""Recommended for You"" feature, an ever-changing list of 10 articles, is not new but it has had more prominence since The Times recently unveiled its redesigned website.  Some readers strongly object. I've heard from many of them over the past several weeks. One, Patti Reid, wrote, ""I find this offensive and ridiculous, since I feel competent to choose articles to read on my own."" Others express privacy concerns - they don't want their preferences tracked; and others protest the commercial applications that allow advertisers to present ads tailored to readers' apparent preferences. A New York reader, D.B. Smith, wrote: ""I subscribe to the NYT - I PAY money every week for access."" He said he was annoyed that The Times tries to ""monetize my patronage."" (Of course, this has been true throughout the history of newspapers, with advertising traditionally making up the lion's share of revenue, and circulation a distant second.) I asked Eileen Murphy, a Times spokeswoman, about these concerns. She told me in an email that the practice is explained in The Times's privacy policy, found at the bottom of its home page. The relevant section is as follows:  Log Files and Your Reading History. We automatically log certain usage information about your use of NYT Service. This information includes a reading history of the pages you view.We use this information in order to provide you with customized Recommendations on NYTimes.com based on your reading history.

If you download and use the Times Reader software application, the log files will automatically be collected by the application and sent to our servers when your computer syncs up for the latest news. The Times does not share those preferences with other readers of The Times or other websites, and it doesn't track what Times articles you share on social media sites like Facebook, according to the privacy policy.

Goodwill Investigating Possible Theft of Credit Card Data,"Updated, 9:29 p.m. | Goodwill Industries International, a nonprofit agency that operates thrift stores around the country, said on Monday that it was investigating a potential security breach that may have led to the theft of customers' credit card data.  In a statement, Goodwill said it had been contacted on Friday afternoon by federal authorities and a fraud investigation unit about a possible data theft at its American store locations. Goodwill said it was working with the authorities. ""At this point, no breach has been confirmed, but an investigation is underway,"" the statement said. ""Goodwill Industries International is working with industry contacts and the federal authorities on the investigation."" The agency said it would ""work proactively with any individual local Goodwill involved, taking appropriate actions if a data compromise is uncovered."" The possible theft wasfirst reported by Brian Krebs, a security blogger, who said that several financial institutions were able to tie an unusually high number of fraudulent purchases back to cards that had recently been used to make purchases at Goodwill stores. Brian Leary, a spokesman for the Secret Service - which has been investigating recent breaches at Target, Neiman Marcus and other retailers - said the agency would not comment on whether it was investigating the possible breach at Goodwill. Goodwill, which is based in Rockville, Md., has 2,900 stores. The shops collect and sell donated clothing and household goods and use the proceeds for work training, job placement services and other community-based initiatives. If the breach at Goodwill is confirmed, it will be the sixth major retail chain - after Target, P.F. Chang's, Neiman Marcus, Michaels and Sally Beauty - to acknowledge that its systems were recently compromised. In those cases, criminals installed so-called malware on retailers' systems, which fed customers' payment details back to their computer servers. The same group of criminals in Eastern Europe is believed to be behind the earlier attacks. The group is also believed to be part of a broader attack directed at as many as six other retailers, according to two people investigating the breaches who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. The entry point for each breach differed, according to one law enforcement official. At Target, it was believed to be a Pennsylvania company that provided heating, air conditioning and refrigeration services to the retailer. Criminals were able to use the company's log-in credentials to gain access to Target's systems and, eventually, its point-of-sale systems. Studies have found that retailers are underprepared for such attacks. A joint study by the Ponemon Institute, an independent security research firm, and DB Networks, a database security firm, found that a majority of computer security experts in the United States believed that their organizations lacked the technology and tools to quickly detect database attacks. Only one-third of those experts said they did the kind of continuous monitoring needed to identify irregular activity in their databases, and an additional 22 percent admitted that they did not scan at all.

New York Proposes First State Regulations for Bitcoin,"New York State's top financial regulator has taken a big step to bring Bitcoin and other virtual currencies under its purview. On Thursday, Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of financial services, announced proposed regulations for virtual currency companies operating in New York. The ""BitLicense"" plan, which includes rules on consumer protection, the prevention of money laundering and cybersecurity, is the first proposal by a state to create guidelines specifically for virtual currency. ""It's a comprehensive framework. It's trying to get at the whole virtual currency ecosystem,"" Mr. Lawsky said in an interview. ""We've tried to build some flexibility into these rules so, as these technologies change, we can bend to allow those innovations to continue.""  The new rules would be required for Bitcoin exchanges and for companies that secure, store or maintain custody or control of the virtual currency on behalf of customers. Merchants that accept Bitcoin for payment, like Overstock.com, would not need to apply for a license. Mr. Lawsky's office, the Department of Financial Services, has not come down particularly hard on Bitcoin. Rather, the rules, the product of a nearly yearlong review, are intended to inspire consumer confidence and promote commerce by encouraging more companies to come to New York. ""My hope is that we're going to create a race to the top,"" Mr. Lawsky said. The rules for Bitcoin companies are aligned with existing regulations for banks and other financial institutions, he said, but are also tailored for virtual currencies. For example, Bitcoin companies would be required to have more robust cybersecurity programs because they are more susceptible to attacks from hackers. As capital protection, these companies would have to hold the same amount of virtual currency as they owed to their customers. But unlike banks, which are also subject to capital requirements, these companies would be allowed to hold some of it in virtual currency. The public will have 45 days from July 23 to comment on the proposal, after which Mr. Lawsky's office intends to make changes to the rules and send them back out for review. Government agencies are still grappling with how to regulate virtual currency. In what was seen as a small step toward government oversight, the Internal Revenue Service announced in March that it would treat Bitcoin like property rather than currency for tax purposes. Other regulators have been more reluctant. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have said the currency is risky but have not enacted regulations. While some in the Bitcoin community see Mr. Lawsky's proposed rules as restrictive, others view them instead as an important step to bring Bitcoin and other computer-based currencies into the mainstream. Still, until other states and government agencies establish their own guidelines, being licensed in New York can only go so far in regulating virtual currency because many of these companies operate across state lines and international boundaries. ""I think ultimately, these rules are going to be good for the industry,"" Mr. Lawsky said. ""The question is if this will spread further."" Since Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by a computer programmer, or group of programmers, it has appealed to a core group of anti-establishment enthusiasts, who have largely operated on the fringes of the financial system. More recently, Bitcoin has been gaining popularity, especially among venture capitalists and investment firms who have anticipated a wider adoption of the currency. But without government protection, many consumers have remained reluctant to use the currency. The lack of regulation has also contributed to Bitcoin's wild price fluctuations, which some say have prevented the currency from becoming more mainstream. In less than five years, the value of a Bitcoin has gone from just a few dollars to more than $1,000. It is now trading around $625, according to the virtual currency website CoinDesk. ""Bitcoin businesses in the U.S. have been looking forward to being regulated,"" said Gil Luria, analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""This is a very big important first step, but it's not the ultimate step.""                       "
New York Financial Regulator Solicits Virtual Currency Proposals,"At a time when some government agencies are backing away from virtual currency, New York's top financial regulator is taking a big step forward. On Tuesday, Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of the state's Department of Financial Services, issued his first public order on virtual currencies like Bitcoin, calling for proposals for creating regulated exchanges.  ""The companies that are now being asked to come apply in this order are going to largely be the companies that say we have the desire, wherewithal and the resources to do this the right way,"" Mr. Lawsky said in an interview. ""We are creating a situation where we'll hopefully be driving consumer confidence in the firms that want to come here now and set up their exchanges with all the appropriate protections in place."" Soliciting companies to formally register with Mr. Lawsky's office is notable, if only for the lack of regulation elsewhere.  Governments around the world are now struggling to figure out how to oversee Bitcoin, a computer-based form of money without a central location, amid mounting concerns about money laundering, drug trafficking and other illicit transactions.  ""I think it's a very big deal,"" Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities who has written about virtual currency, said of Mr. Lawsky's order. ""I think this is the type of regulatory treatment Bitcoin was hoping for."" Bitcoin has quickly gained a loyal following of technology entrepreneurs, venture capital firms and anti-establishment libertarians drawn to a payment system that circumvents the traditional banking industry.  But the collapse of one of Bitcoin's largest exchanges last month turned up the heat on federal authorities to issue better regulations. Mt. Gox, which at one point handled 80 percent of all Bitcoin transactions, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and Japan, claiming to have lost nearly 750,000 of its customers' Bitcoins, worth close to $500 million. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulator, put out a warning to investors on Tuesday about fraud and other risks it associates with the virtual currency. Mr. Lawsky has in the past made his openness to Bitcoin clear. He said on Tuesday that his office will be looking for sufficient cybersecurity protections and capital reserves, and will conduct background checks on any potential management teams. Mr. Lawsky's office has not yet come out with the regulatory framework that would ultimately guide any proposals, however. In a statement, the office says it that intends to come out with such framework ""no later than the end of the second quarter of 2014,"" and that it was working on a ""BitLicense"" for companies operating in New York.   But until other states and countries implement their own virtual currency guidelines, registration in New York can only go so far for companies that operate in multiple jurisdictions.  ""If we do it right, it could be a nice model for other states,"" Mr. Lawsky said.   "
Russian Hackers Steal Passwords of Billion Users,"A Russian crime ring has amassed the largest known collection of stolen Internet credentials, including 1.2 billion user name and password combinations and more than 500 million email addresses, security researchers say. The records, discovered by Hold Security, a firm in Milwaukee, include confidential material gathered from 420,000 websites, including household names, and small Internet sites. Hold Security has a history of uncovering significant hacks, including the theft last year of tens of millions of records from Adobe Systems. Hold Security would not name the victims, citing nondisclosure agreements and a reluctance to name companies whose sites remained vulnerable. At the request of The New York Times, a security expert not affiliated with Hold Security analyzed the database of stolen credentials and confirmed it was authentic. Another computer crime expert who had reviewed the data, but was not allowed to discuss it publicly, said some big companies were aware that their records were among the stolen information. ''Hackers did not just target U.S. companies, they targeted any website they could get, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to very small websites,'' said Alex Holden, the founder and chief information security officer of Hold Security. ''And most of these sites are still vulnerable.''  Mr. Holden, who is paid to consult on the security of corporate websites, decided to make details of the attack public this week to coincide with discussions at an industry conference and to let the many small sites he will not be able to contact know that they should look into the problem. There is worry among some in the security community that keeping personal information out of the hands of thieves is increasingly a losing battle. In December, 40 million credit card numbers and 70 million addresses, phone numbers and additional pieces of personal information were stolen from the retail giant Target by hackers in Eastern Europe. And in October, federal prosecutors said an identity theft service in Vietnam managed to obtain as many as 200 million personal records, including Social Security numbers, credit card data and bank account information from Court Ventures, a company now owned by the data brokerage firm Experian. But the discovery by Hold Security dwarfs those incidents, and the size of the latest discovery has prompted security experts to call for improved identity protection on the web. ''Companies that rely on user names and passwords have to develop a sense of urgency about changing this,'' said Avivah Litan, a security analyst at the research firm Gartner. ''Until they do, criminals will just keep stockpiling people's credentials.'' Websites inside Russia had been hacked, too, and Mr. Holden said he saw no connection between the hackers and the Russian government. He said he planned to alert law enforcement after making the research public, though the Russian government has not historically pursued accused hackers. So far, the criminals have not sold many of the records online. Instead, they appear to be using the stolen information to send spam on social networks like Twitter at the behest of other groups, collecting fees for their work. But selling more of the records on the black market would be lucrative. While a credit card can be easily canceled, personal credentials like an email address, Social Security number or password can be used for identity theft. Because people tend to use the same passwords for different sites, criminals test stolen credentials on websites where valuable information can be gleaned, like those of banks and brokerage firms. Like other computer security consulting firms, Hold Security has contacts in the criminal hacking community and has been monitoring and even communicating with this particular group for some time. The hacking ring is based in a small city in south central Russia, the region flanked by Kazakhstan and Mongolia. The group includes fewer than a dozen men in their 20s who know one another personally -- not just virtually. Their computer servers are thought to be in Russia. ''There is a division of labor within the gang,'' Mr. Holden said. ''Some are writing the programming, some are stealing the data. It's like you would imagine a small company; everyone is trying to make a living.'' They began as amateur spammers in 2011, buying stolen databases of personal information on the black market. But in April, the group accelerated its activity. Mr. Holden surmised they partnered with another entity, whom he has not identified, that may have shared hacking techniques and tools. Since then, the Russian hackers have been able to capture credentials on a mass scale using botnets -- networks of zombie computers that have been infected with a computer virus -- to do their bidding. Any time an infected user visits a website, criminals command the botnet to test that website to see if it is vulnerable to a well-known hacking technique known as an SQL injection, in which a hacker enters commands that cause a database to produce its contents. If the website proves vulnerable, criminals flag the site and return later to extract the full contents of the database. ''They audited the Internet,'' Mr. Holden said. It was not clear, however, how computers were infected with the botnet in the first place. By July, criminals were able to collect 4.5 billion records -- each a user name and password -- though many overlapped. After sorting through the data, Hold Security found that 1.2 billion of those records were unique. Because people tend to use multiple emails, they filtered further and found that the criminals' database included about 542 million unique email addresses. ''Most of these sites are still vulnerable,'' said Mr. Holden, emphasizing that the hackers continue to exploit the vulnerability and collect data. Mr. Holden said his team had begun alerting victimized companies to the breaches, but had been unable to reach every website. He said his firm was also trying to come up with an online tool that would allow individuals to securely test for their information in the database. The disclosure comes as hackers and security companies gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Black Hat security conference this week. The event, which began as a small hacker convention in 1997, now attracts thousands of security vendors peddling the latest and greatest in security technologies. At the conference, security firms often release research -- to land new business, discuss with colleagues or simply for bragging rights. Yet for all the new security mousetraps, data security breaches have only gotten larger, more frequent and more costly. The average total cost of a data breach to a company increased 15 percent this year from last year, to $3.5 million per breach, from $3.1 million, according to a joint study last May, published by the Ponemon Institute, an independent research group, and IBM. Last February, Mr. Holden also uncovered a database of 360 million records for sale, which were collected from multiple companies. ''The ability to attack is certainly outpacing the ability to defend,'' said Lillian Ablon, a security researcher at the RAND Corporation. ''We're constantly playing this cat and mouse game, but ultimately companies just patch and pray.'' Nicole Perlroth reported from San Francisco and David Gelles from New York City. "
N.S.A. Devises Radio Pathway Into Computers,"WASHINGTON -- The National Security Agency has implanted software in nearly 100,000 computers around the world that allows the United States to conduct surveillance on those machines and can also create a digital highway for launching cyberattacks. While most of the software is inserted by gaining access to computer networks, the N.S.A. has increasingly made use of a secret technology that enables it to enter and alter data in computers even if they are not connected to the Internet, according to N.S.A. documents, computer experts and American officials. The technology, which the agency has used since at least 2008, relies on a covert channel of radio waves that can be transmitted from tiny circuit boards and USB cards inserted surreptitiously into the computers. In some cases, they are sent to a briefcase-size relay station that intelligence agencies can set up miles away from the target. The radio frequency technology has helped solve one of the biggest problems facing American intelligence agencies for years: getting into computers that adversaries, and some American partners, have tried to make impervious to spying or cyberattack. In most cases, the radio frequency hardware must be physically inserted by a spy, a manufacturer or an unwitting user.  The N.S.A. calls its efforts more an act of ''active defense'' against foreign cyberattacks than a tool to go on the offensive. But when Chinese attackers place similar software on the computer systems of American companies or government agencies, American officials have protested, often at the presidential level. Among the most frequent targets of the N.S.A. and its Pentagon partner, United States Cyber Command, have been units of the Chinese Army, which the United States has accused of launching regular digital probes and attacks on American industrial and military targets, usually to steal secrets or intellectual property. But the program, code-named Quantum, has also been successful in inserting software into Russian military networks and systems used by the Mexican police and drug cartels, trade institutions inside the European Union, and sometime partners against terrorism like Saudi Arabia, India and Pakistan, according to officials and an N.S.A. map that indicates sites of what the agency calls ''computer network exploitation.'' ''What's new here is the scale and the sophistication of the intelligence agency's ability to get into computers and networks to which no one has ever had access before,'' said James Andrew Lewis, the cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''Some of these capabilities have been around for a while, but the combination of learning how to penetrate systems to insert software and learning how to do that using radio frequencies has given the U.S. a window it's never had before.'' No Domestic Use Seen There is no evidence that the N.S.A. has implanted its software or used its radio frequency technology inside the United States. While refusing to comment on the scope of the Quantum program, the N.S.A. said its actions were not comparable to China's. ''N.S.A.'s activities are focused and specifically deployed against -- and only against -- valid foreign intelligence targets in response to intelligence requirements,'' Vanee Vines, an agency spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''We do not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of -- or give intelligence we collect to -- U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line.'' Over the past two months, parts of the program have been disclosed in documents from the trove leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor. A Dutch newspaper published the map of areas where the United States has inserted spy software, sometimes in cooperation with local authorities, often covertly. Der Spiegel, a German newsmagazine, published the N.S.A.'s catalog of hardware products that can secretly transmit and receive digital signals from computers, a program called ANT. The New York Times withheld some of those details, at the request of American intelligence officials, when it reported, in the summer of 2012, on American cyberattacks on Iran. President Obama is scheduled to announce on Friday what recommendations he is accepting from an advisory panel on changing N.S.A. practices. The panel agreed with Silicon Valley executives that some of the techniques developed by the agency to find flaws in computer systems undermine global confidence in a range of American-made information products like laptop computers and cloud services. Embracing Silicon Valley's critique of the N.S.A., the panel has recommended banning, except in extreme cases, the N.S.A. practice of exploiting flaws in common software to aid in American surveillance and cyberattacks. It also called for an end to government efforts to weaken publicly available encryption systems, and said the government should never develop secret ways into computer systems to exploit them, which sometimes include software implants. Richard A. Clarke, an official in the Clinton and Bush administrations who served as one of the five members of the advisory panel, explained the group's reasoning in an email last week, saying that ''it is more important that we defend ourselves than that we attack others.'' ''Holes in encryption software would be more of a risk to us than a benefit,'' he said, adding: ''If we can find the vulnerability, so can others. It's more important that we protect our power grid than that we get into China's.'' From the earliest days of the Internet, the N.S.A. had little trouble monitoring traffic because a vast majority of messages and searches were moved through servers on American soil. As the Internet expanded, so did the N.S.A.'s efforts to understand its geography. A program named Treasure Map tried to identify nearly every node and corner of the web, so that any computer or mobile device that touched it could be located. A 2008 map, part of the Snowden trove, notes 20 programs to gain access to big fiber-optic cables -- it calls them ''covert, clandestine or cooperative large accesses'' -- not only in the United States but also in places like Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Middle East. The same map indicates that the United States had already conducted ''more than 50,000 worldwide implants,'' and a more recent budget document said that by the end of last year that figure would rise to about 85,000. A senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the actual figure was most likely closer to 100,000. That map suggests how the United States was able to speed ahead with implanting malicious software on the computers around the world that it most wanted to monitor -- or disable before they could be used to launch a cyberattack. A Focus on Defense In interviews, officials and experts said that a vast majority of such implants are intended only for surveillance and serve as an early warning system for cyberattacks directed at the United States. ''How do you ensure that Cyber Command people'' are able to look at ''those that are attacking us?'' a senior official, who compared it to submarine warfare, asked in an interview several months ago. ''That is what the submarines do all the time,'' said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe policy. ''They track the adversary submarines.'' In cyberspace, he said, the United States tries ''to silently track the adversaries while they're trying to silently track you.'' If tracking subs was a Cold War cat-and-mouse game with the Soviets, tracking malware is a pursuit played most aggressively with the Chinese. The United States has targeted Unit 61398, the Shanghai-based Chinese Army unit believed to be responsible for many of the biggest cyberattacks on the United States, in an effort to see attacks being prepared. With Australia's help, one N.S.A. document suggests, the United States has also focused on another specific Chinese Army unit. Documents obtained by Mr. Snowden indicate that the United States has set up two data centers in China -- perhaps through front companies -- from which it can insert malware into computers. When the Chinese place surveillance software on American computer systems -- and they have, on systems like those at the Pentagon and at The Times -- the United States usually regards it as a potentially hostile act, a possible prelude to an attack. Mr. Obama laid out America's complaints about those practices to President Xi Jinping of China in a long session at a summit meeting in California last June. At that session, Mr. Obama tried to differentiate between conducting surveillance for national security -- which the United States argues is legitimate -- and conducting it to steal intellectual property. ''The argument is not working,'' said Peter W. Singer of the Brookings Institution, a co-author of a new book called ''Cybersecurity and Cyberwar.'' ''To the Chinese, gaining economic advantage is part of national security. And the Snowden revelations have taken a lot of the pressure off'' the Chinese. Still, the United States has banned the sale of computer servers from a major Chinese manufacturer, Huawei, for fear that they could contain technology to penetrate American networks. An Old Technology The N.S.A.'s efforts to reach computers unconnected to a network have relied on a century-old technology updated for modern times: radio transmissions. In a catalog produced by the agency that was part of the Snowden documents released in Europe, there are page after page of devices using technology that would have brought a smile to Q, James Bond's technology supplier. One, called Cottonmouth I, looks like a normal USB plug but has a tiny transceiver buried in it. According to the catalog, it transmits information swept from the computer ''through a covert channel'' that allows ''data infiltration and exfiltration.'' Another variant of the technology involves tiny circuit boards that can be inserted in a laptop computer -- either in the field or when they are shipped from manufacturers -- so that the computer is broadcasting to the N.S.A. even while the computer's user enjoys the false confidence that being walled off from the Internet constitutes real protection. The relay station it communicates with, called Nightstand, fits in an oversize briefcase, and the system can attack a computer ''from as far away as eight miles under ideal environmental conditions.'' It can also insert packets of data in milliseconds, meaning that a false message or piece of programming can outrace a real one to a target computer. Similar stations create a link between the target computers and the N.S.A., even if the machines are isolated from the Internet. Computers are not the only targets. Dropoutjeep attacks iPhones. Other hardware and software are designed to infect large network servers, including those made by the Chinese. Most of those code names and products are now at least five years old, and they have been updated, some experts say, to make the United States less dependent on physically getting hardware into adversaries' computer systems. The N.S.A. refused to talk about the documents that contained these descriptions, even after they were published in Europe. ''Continuous and selective publication of specific techniques and tools used by N.S.A. to pursue legitimate foreign intelligence targets is detrimental to the security of the United States and our allies,'' Ms. Vines, the N.S.A. spokeswoman, said. But the Iranians and others discovered some of those techniques years ago. The hardware in the N.S.A.'s catalog was crucial in the cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, code-named Olympic Games, that began around 2008 and proceeded through the summer of 2010, when a technical error revealed the attack software, later called Stuxnet. That was the first major test of the technology. One feature of the Stuxnet attack was that the technology the United States slipped into Iran's nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz was able to map how it operated, then ''phone home'' the details. Later, that equipment was used to insert malware that blew up nearly 1,000 centrifuges, and temporarily set back Iran's program. But the Stuxnet strike does not appear to be the last time the technology was used in Iran. In 2012, a unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps moved a rock near the country's underground Fordo nuclear enrichment plant. The rock exploded and spewed broken circuit boards that the Iranian news media described as ''the remains of a device capable of intercepting data from computers at the plant.'' The origins of that device have never been determined. On Sunday, according to the semiofficial Fars news agency, Iran's Oil Ministry issued another warning about possible cyberattacks, describing a series of defenses it was erecting -- and making no mention of what are suspected of being its own attacks on Saudi Arabia's largest oil producer. "
Breach at Neiman Marcus Went Undetected From July to December,"The computer network at Neiman Marcus was penetrated by hackers as far back as July, and the breach was not fully contained until Sunday, according to people briefed on the investigation. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, saying it first learned in mid-December of suspicious activity that involved credit cards used at its stores. It issued another notice on Thursday, elaborating slightly. The latest notice said that ''some of our customers' payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at our stores. We have taken steps to notify those affected customers for whom we have contact information.''  The company apologized again, and said it did not believe the customers' Social Security numbers or birth dates -- key pieces of personal data -- had been compromised. Neiman Marcus defended its decision not to disclose anything until last week, saying it waited to confirm evidence. The company said nothing about when the attack began and when it was contained. In a call with credit card companies on Monday, though, Neiman acknowledged that the attack had only been fully contained a day earlier, and that the time stamp on the first intrusion was in mid-July, people briefed on the call said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the investigation. The issue at Neiman appears to have gone on for significantly longer than the widespread attack on Target. In Target's case, however, the data that was stolen appears to be much more significant and ripe for fraud. Target has said card numbers from 40 million customers were stolen, along with encrypted PINs for debit cards. It also estimated that other personal information belonging to 70 million people had been stolen by the hackers. Neiman Marcus said on Thursday that it had ''no knowledge of any connection'' between its data breach and Target's. Neiman has not publicly given any estimate of how many credit card numbers were stolen, or how many customers were affected. But it noted that it does not collect PINs in its stores. The company only publicly acknowledged the data breach last Friday after facing inquiries from a journalist specializing in computer security, Brian Krebs. But Neiman had told credit card companies around Christmas, in an industry phone call, that it had evidence that credit cards used at Neiman Marcus were being used to make fraudulent purchases, people who were briefed on those phone calls said. Neiman has faced criticism for not telling customers about the breach sooner. Target informed its customers about its attack within a few days of learning about it for the first time, pushed also by inquiries from Mr. Krebs. Target's acknowledgment came right before the final holiday shopping weekend, and put a significant dent in Target's sales in the final seasonal rush. Some people briefed on the investigation questioned Neiman's decision not to disclose anything to the public until the shopping season was over. One person briefed by law enforcement on the investigation noted: ''January 1 is conveniently timed after the holiday season.'' A spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus, Ginger Reeder, asserted on Thursday that the holiday season had nothing to do with its decision. In its notice on Thursday, the company said: ''We quickly began our investigation and hired a forensic investigator. Our forensic investigator discovered evidence on Jan. 1st that a criminal cybersecurity intrusion had occurred. The forensic and criminal investigations continue.'' Neiman said it would provide customers with one free year of credit monitoring, similar to what Target has offered. A growing group of state attorneys general, including those from Connecticut, New York and Illinois, are jointly investigating both the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches. The authorities are examining whether the two attacks are related. Both appear to have been committed by criminal groups in Eastern Europe, people briefed on the investigation said. "
Finding a Needle in a Digital Haystack,"Tim White is the global head of government and intelligence for YarcData, a data analytics firm. PLEASANTON, Calif. -- LAST year the private sector spent $67.2 billion on cybersecurity services. Nevertheless, according to a recent investigation by Verizon, 60 percent of successful hacks were not detected until months after the attacks began. In the wake of recent high-profile hacker attacks against Target, Neiman Marcus and other retailers, the obvious question is: Why hasn't all that money done any good? It's not for lack of trying. Much of the money is well spent, paying for armies of technical engineers and state-of-the-art security applications.  The problem is not the resources, or the personnel, or the data. It's that many organizations simply don't know how to arrange the data to identify suspicious patterns and weaknesses, at least not fast enough. There's too much data, and not enough perspective. What we need, then, is not necessarily more money or information, but a better way of knowing what it means -- of interpreting the data to discover an unknown attack as it happens or, even better, anticipate the next attack. The amount of security-related data that the typical enterprise manages today is staggering. A Fortune 500-size company could have over an exabyte (a billion gigabytes) of data scattered across thousands of servers and hundreds of thousands of software applications. All told, a detailed investigation of a complex, stealthy attack could involve trillions of discrete data points. Most of those data points, even security-related points, are noise. Warnings are generated each time an easily blocked virus tries to gain access, or an employee enters the wrong password. Across a large company, that could mean thousands of warnings a day, all of which must be investigated. This noise makes the job of rapidly identifying serious attacks an overwhelming task. The solution lies in finding a way to examine the data so that analysts can quickly identify suspicious patterns. Instead of programs to generate more data, we need different tools to understand them. And it turns out that the best tools are right in our heads: our eyes. The fast-growing field of graph analytics involves the creation of a visual representation of ''objects'' within an organization: people, devices, computers, applications. The relationships are displayed as lines linking objects. (My company, YarcData, develops graph-analytic platforms for a variety of applications.) With this type of analysis, objects and their relationships uncover connections that are hidden in the numbers but obvious to the eye. It allows a user to see, immediately, the object's broader context. A failed attack on one computer might not raise a flag on its own -- but it could if an analyst saw, simultaneously, that the target was connected to other critical targets, or that the attack was a modification of a recent failed attack. Our brains conduct such contextual assessments every day, albeit on a much simpler, smaller scale. Think about when one hears a strange noise. Within a split second our mind connects the noise with its context. And we can ask creative questions, drawing on seemingly unrelated correlations that a computer program could never be robust enough to handle. Was it late at night? Is the family dog in that room? If it was in the middle of the day and the dog was in that room, we would react differently than if it was a strange noise late at night, with the dog asleep at our feet and no one else in the house. Consider another example: My phone has just mysteriously connected to a website I have never visited, or intended to visit. Our minds ask the same sorts of contextual questions: Am I using the phone? What time of day is it? How many websites have I visited in the last five minutes? The last 30 minutes? Could a new app be connecting to sites to bump ad revenues? All this information is already present in a company's data network. Graph analytics facilitates presentation in a visual fashion to allow our eyes, and brains, to do the top-level processing, enabling rapid understanding of all these events, then identifying the difference that would explain whether it was a malicious application or just a harmless bit of spam. Someone, somewhere, has to decide on a fast, accurate response. Why hasn't this been done already? The industry has tried. But the speed and scope in computing power were not available until recently. And of course, with so much invested in traditional cybersecurity methods, many companies have been loath to try something new. That must change soon. Target has pledged to make ''significant changes,'' and it's likely that name-brand retailers around the globe will be undertaking security audits and taking measures to harden themselves against attacks and protect customer data. Winning at cybersecurity today isn't necessarily about collecting more data. It is about unleashing the information in the data that's already there -- and doing so not in weeks, days and hours, but in minutes and seconds. "
Symantec Fires Chief Seen as Too Slow on Innovation,"Symantec, the troubled antivirus software maker, has fired Steve Bennett, its chief executive, the company said on Thursday. In a special meeting Tuesday evening, Symantec's board voted to oust Mr. Bennett after deciding that he was not moving quickly enough to innovate on new products and growth initiatives, according to a person close to the board who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Though Symantec is still the leader in a pack of security companies, it has found itself in the difficult position of fending off a growing list of upstarts for a larger share of the security market, which is expected to increase nearly 30 percent to $87 billion by 2016, according to Gartner, the research firm.  Traditional antivirus software from older companies like Symantec is typically reactive: A computer virus must be identified and dissected before it can be blocked. Younger companies like Palo Alto Networks and FireEye take a novel, more proactive approach to cyberthreats. They do things like monitor unusual behavior on a computer network to determine if it is under attack. That allows a new threat to be detected before it does damage. Symantec has not made a significant push into mobile computing, which is where many security researchers contend the next generation of threats will reside. About 50 companies compete with Symantec, according to analysts at Gartner. At Gartner's last count, in 2012, Symantec led the security software market, with 19.6 percent share, followed by McAfee, with 8.8 percent. But analysts say the incumbents are ceding ground to start-ups. And compared with the young competition, Symantec was ''not really innovating,'' said Rick Holland, an analyst at Forrester, a research firm. Mr. Bennett discussed the upstart competition in an interview in January. ''We're running a marathon, not a sprint,'' he said. ''When we're at the end of the finish line, sometime in the future, we're going to be there and we're going to be smiling. And we'll see where all these shiny-new-object companies are.'' But a person close to Symantec's board said that its members believed the company needed to move faster, specifically in terms of new products and revenue growth. The company said Thursday that revenue in its current fiscal quarter, which ends this month, is expected to be down more than 5 percent from the period a year ago, to $1.65 billion. Mr. Bennett became chief executive of Symantec in July 2012 after ousting Enrique Salem as chief. Mr. Salem had been with the company 19 years. Mr. Bennett was Symantec's chairman at the time. He had been chief executive of the financial software maker Intuit, but was pushed out by the Intuit board in the face of slow sales growth. At Symantec, Mr. Bennett was charged with leading the company's turnaround from an antivirus company to a security company. But his short tenure was marked by executive departures, including that of the chief financial officer and several business unit leaders, and declining revenue. Symantec has also struggled to recruit top talent as young engineers favor younger security upstarts like Lookout, the mobile security company, FireEye and Palo Alto Networks, and companies like Facebook and Google, which are strengthening their security teams. Those factors were enough to convince the board that it needed a new leader, the person close to the discussions said. Mr. Holland, of Forrester, said that firing Mr. Bennett so soon after the company's last chief executive was ousted could make it difficult to recruit employees. ''It's going to take even longer for them to rebound now,'' he said. Symantec has appointed Michael Brown, a board member, as interim president and chief executive, while David Mahoney, another longtime board member, is leading the search for a new executive. The person close to the board said the company was looking for a chief executive with technology experience, particularly mobile, though a background in security was not necessarily a prerequisite. Shares of Symantec were down 6 percent in after-hours trading Thursday. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
U.S. Case Offers Glimpse Into China's Hacker Army,"BEIJING -- One man accused of being a hacker for the Chinese military, Wang Dong, better known as UglyGorilla, wrote in a social media profile that he did not ''have much ambition'' but wanted ''to wander the world with a sword, an idiot.'' Another, Sun Kailiang, also known as Jack Sun, grew up in wealthy Pei County in eastern China, the home of a peasant who founded the ancient Han dynasty and was idolized by Mao. They and three others were indicted by the United States Justice Department this week, charged with being part of a Chinese military unit that has hacked the computers of prominent American companies to steal commercial secrets, presumably for the benefit of Chinese companies.  Much about them remains murky. But Chinese websites, as well as interviews with cybersecurity experts and former hackers inside and outside China, reveal some common traits among those and other hackers, and show that China's hacking culture is a complex mosaic of shifting motivations, employers and allegiances. Many hackers working directly for the Chinese government are men in their 20s and 30s who have been trained at universities run by the People's Liberation Army and are employed by the state in myriad ways. Those working directly for the military usually follow a 9-to-5 weekday schedule and are not well paid, experts and former hackers said. Some military and government employees moonlight as mercenaries and do more hacking on their own time, selling their skills to state-owned and private companies. Some belong to the same online social networking groups. ''There are many types of relationships,'' said Adam Segal, a China and cybersecurity scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. ''Some P.L.A. hackers offer their services under contract to state-owned enterprises. For some critical technologies, it is possible that P.L.A. hackers are tasked with attacks on specific foreign companies.'' The Obama administration makes a distinction between hacking to protect national security, which it calls fair play, and hacking to obtain trade secrets that would give an edge to corporations, which it says is illegal. China and other nations accuse the United States of being the biggest perpetrator of both kinds of espionage. In what may be Chinese retaliation for the indictments, a state agency announced plans on Thursday for tighter checks on Internet companies that do business in China. The State Internet Information Office said the government would establish new procedures to assess potential security problems with Internet technology and with services used by sectors ''related to national security and the public interest,'' reported Xinhua, the state-run news agency. In the indictments, unsealed on Monday, the United States accused Mr. Wang, Mr. Sun and three others of working in the Chinese Army's Unit 61398, which a report last year by Mandiant, a cybersecurity company in Alexandria, Va., said operated out of a 12-story white tower on the outskirts of Shanghai. That unit is now the most infamous of China's suspected hacking groups, and the Western cybersecurity industry variously calls it the Comment Crew, the Shanghai Group and APT1. Some members are active on Chinese social media. Mr. Wang, Mr. Sun and another of the men indicted, Wen Xinyu, are part of a group on QQ, a social networking and messaging tool, that calls itself ''Poor Folks Fed by Public Funds,'' according to an Internet search. The group, which has 24 members, also includes Mei Qiang, a hacking suspect named in the Mandiant report whose alias is SuperHard. Another member, Xu Yaoling, has the same name as someone from the P.L.A. University of Science and Technology, a military institution in Nanjing, who has written papers on hacking and cybersecurity. Mr. Wang posted messages on an official Chinese military forum in 2004 under the alias Green Field. He called himself a ''military enthusiast'' and asked in one thread, ''Does our military have the capabilities to fight against American troops?'' His forum profile listed an English name, Jack Wang, and an email address; messages sent this week to that address went unanswered. He has been known to leave a signature, ''ug,'' on malware he has created. ''I think they're soldiers with some training in computer technology, not technology people drafted into the military,'' said a former hacker who has done what he calls defensive work for the Chinese Army and security agencies. The Comment Crew is not the only big player in China, where hacking is as common in the corporate and criminal worlds as in the government. It is even promoted at trade shows, in classrooms and on Internet forums. Western cybersecurity experts usually focus on hackers with state ties. FireEye, a cybersecurity company in Milpitas, Calif., that bought Mandiant in January, is tracking at least 25 ''active Chinese-based threat groups,'' of which 22 support the state in some way, said Darien Kindlund, the company's manager of threat intelligence. At least five appear to be tied directly to one or more military groups, Mr. Kindlund said, adding that this was a conservative estimate. Joe Stewart, a cybersecurity expert at Dell SecureWorks, said that as of last year, the Comment Crew and a unit he called the Beijing Group were using ''the lion's share'' of 25,000 suspicious online domains he had been tracking. The Beijing Group, he said, used a dedicated block of I.P. addresses that could be traced to the Chinese capital and to the network of China Unicom, one of the three biggest state-owned Internet telecommunications companies. ''There's espionage activity coming out of that,'' Mr. Stewart said, though he added that he had seen no evidence of the Beijing Group's working with China Unicom or any other state entity. A man who answered a China Unicom spokesman's cellphone declined to comment. The targets pursued by the Comment Crew and the Beijing Group overlap -- both go after foreign corporations and government agencies, for example -- but the Beijing unit also takes aim at ''activist types,'' Mr. Stewart said, including ethnic Tibetan and Uighur exile groups. The two units are responsible for creating most of the world's 300 known families of malware, he added. Western cybersecurity experts saw a surge of online espionage attacks on corporations starting in late 2006. Before that, attacks had been aimed mostly at government agencies or contractors. The experts said much of the initial wave of corporate espionage was traced to China, and specifically to the Comment Crew. About a year later, the Beijing Group appeared on the scene. A smaller unit, the Kunming Group, whose attacks have been traced to I.P. addresses in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, seemed focused on targets in Vietnam, Mr. Stewart said. It deployed malware and so-called spear phishing attacks that tried to entice victims to click on messages and links in Vietnamese. It is unclear exactly what the Kunming Group sought to achieve, but tensions between China and Vietnam have been rising in recent years over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. China moved an oil rig near Vietnam this month, an action Vietnam has protested. Vietnam is also working with foreign oil companies to drill and explore in that sea. Though the Obama administration has focused on exposing corporate espionage, hackers suspected of working for the Chinese government have breached a wide range of foreign government agencies, cybersecurity experts say. For example, FireEye said it had observed spying attacks on Taiwanese government agencies and on a professor in India who held pro-Tibet views. The company called the attackers the Shiqiang Gang. A mainland Chinese group also carried out attacks on Japanese government agencies and companies last September by putting commands on Japanese news media websites that would infect users. Mr. Kindlund, the FireEye executive, said people in his industry looked at a variety of factors to determine whether a hacker was a state employee or private contractor. One is the hacker's security methods: Military hackers are less sloppy. Another is the victims: A hacker who jumps among wildly divergent victims, he said, is likely to be a contractor. In recent months, FireEye observed a hacker who took aim at foreign defense and aerospace companies, then hacked an online entertainment company. It appeared the hacker was a private contractor, Mr. Kindlund said. There is no proven method of getting a Chinese hacking unit to back down. In early 2013, American officials hoped that the release of the Mandiant report and loud criticism of Chinese cyberespionage by the Obama administration would silence the Comment Crew. The unit went dormant but resurfaced within five months, Mr. Kindlund said. Now, its attacks have returned to pre-2013 levels. ''They're using similar tactics but launching attacks from different infrastructure,'' Mr. Kindlund said. ''The tools are only slightly modified. Over all, most of the changes are very minor.'' "
JPMorgan Discovers Further Cyber Security Issues,"Updated, 1:15 p.m. | For the second time in roughly three months, JPMorgan Chase is scrambling to contain the fallout from a security breach of its vast computer network, according to several people with knowledge of the investigation.  JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, recently found that hackers, with links to Italy or southern Europe, had gained entry to some of the bank's servers, these people said. The discovery follows an attack that was uncovered in late July and suggests that it was more extensive than first thought. In that attack, hackers obtained entry to dozens of the bank's servers and reviewed information on more than one million customer accounts. Security experts briefed on the matter had said that the full extent of the July attack was not known and that it could take the bank months to discover all of the fallout. It is unclear whether the latest discovery constitutes a second breach or is part of broader fallout from the first incident. The revelation illustrates the challenges for JPMorgan as the bank tries to secure all its systems against another threat.  The original hack sent ripples through the financial system and prompted an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, even as Wall Street, which has been a frequent target for hackers in recent years, worked to guard against the threats. The bank was also forced to update its regulators, including the Federal Reserve, on the extent of the breach. The bank said at the time that there was no indication that any customer money was taken and that it believed it had secured all its systems. On Thursday, the bank's top executives, including Gordon A. Smith, who heads JPMorgan's community and consumer banking, were working to assess the extent of the latest attack, according to two bank executives. A spokesman for JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment. After Breach, JPMorgan Still Seeks to Determine Extent of Attack "
New Russian Boldness Revives a Cold War Tradition: Testing the Other Side,"WASHINGTON -- When the White House discovered in recent weeks that its unclassified computer systems had been breached, intelligence officials examined the digital evidence and focused on a prime suspect: Russia, which they believe is using its highly sophisticated cyber capabilities to test American defenses. But its tracks were well covered, and officials say they may never know for sure. They have no doubt, however, about what happened this week on the edges of NATO territory in Europe. More than two dozen Russian aircraft, including four Tu-95 strategic bombers, flew through the Baltic and Black Seas, along the coast of Norway and all the way to Portugal, staying over international waters but prompting NATO forces to send up intercepting aircraft.  Taken together, they represent the old and the updated techniques of Cold War signal-sending. In the Soviet era, both sides probed each other's defenses, hoping to learn something from the reaction those tests of will created. In 2014, cyber is the new weapon, one that can be used with less restraint, and because its creators believe they cannot be traced and can create a bit of havoc without prompting a response. In this case, the response was that the White House shut down use of some of its networks for lengthy periods -- more an inconvenience than anything else, but a sign of the fragility of the system to sophisticated attacks. But in both, divining the motive of the probes and the advantage, if any, they created is far from easy. The Russian aircraft exercises were part of a broader escalation: NATO has conducted more than 100 intercepts of Russian aircraft this year, its officials report, far more than last year, before Russia annexed Crimea and began its operations in Ukraine. ''This is message-sending by Putin, and it's dangerous,'' one senior defense official said Wednesday, noting that in many cases, the Russian aircraft had turned off their transponders and did not reply to radio calls to identify themselves. In response, Germany, Portugal, Turkey and Denmark sent aircraft aloft, along with two non-NATO nations, Finland and Sweden. They were particularly struck by the use of the Tu-95 bombers, which Russia usually keeps clear of Europe. But what's new is the sophistication of Russia's cyberespionage campaigns, which differ somewhat from China's. The Chinese attacks -- like those led by Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army, whose members were indicted earlier this year by the Justice Department -- are aimed chiefly at intellectual property theft. The Russians do a bit of that, too, but the attacks also suggest more disruptive motives. Last year, security researchers at several American cybersecurity companies uncovered a Russian cyberespionage campaign, in which Russian hackers were systematically hacking more than one thousand Western oil and gas computers, and energy investment firms. The first motive, given Moscow's dependence on its oil and gas industry, was likely industrial espionage. But the manner in which hackers were choosing their targets also seemed intended to seize control of industrial control systems remotely, in much the same way the United States and Israel were able to take control of the Iranian nuclear facility at Natanz when it attacked its computer systems with malware through the summer of 2010, disabling a fifth of Iran's centrifuges at the time. In the case of the attack on the White House's unclassified computer system, officials say no data was destroyed. ''The activity of concern is not being used to enable a destructive attack,'' Bernadette Meehan, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said Thursday. She would not say which country or hacking group was suspected of being behind the attack. But there is evidence that the internal alarms at the White House were not set off -- a sign of the sophistication of the attack. Instead, the United States was alerted by a ''friendly ally,'' one official said. That suggests the ally saw the results of the attack on a foreign network, perhaps picking up evidence of what data had been lifted. Armond Caglar, a cybersecurity expert for TSC Advantage, a consultancy in Washington that focuses on these kinds of attacks, said the motive could be ''to test what the security culture is, or to get valuable information about the security posture at the White House.'' But that posture is quite different for classified systems. He also said it could be to ''prepare for more graduated attacks'' against better protected networks, including SIPRnet, the classified system Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Bradley Manning, entered to turn over hundreds of thousands of documents to WikiLeaks in 2010. Russian hackers -- those working for the government and those engaged in ''patriotic hacking'' -- are considered particularly stealthy. In several cases, security researchers have found evidence that hackers were probing the very core of victims' machines, the part of the computer known as the BIOS, or basic input output system. Unlike software, which can be patched or updated, once the BIOS of a machine is infected with malware, it often renders the machine unusable. Researchers have also found that the hackers were remarkably adept at covering their tracks, using encryption to cover their tools, but their digital crumbs left no doubt that they were Russian. Their tools were built and maintained during Moscow working hours, and snippets of Russian were found in the code. Though researchers were unable to tie the attacks directly to the state, they concluded that Russian government backing was likely, given their sophistication and resources. Since researchers uncovered the campaign last year, they say the attacks have become more aggressive and sophisticated. Early last month, security researchers uncovered a separate Russian cyberespionage campaign that used a zero-day vulnerability -- a software bug that had never been reported in Microsoft's Windows operating system -- to launch cyberattacks on a long list of Russian adversaries. Among them: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, European governments, the government of Ukraine, academics who focused on Ukraine, and visitors of the GlobSec conference, an annual national security gathering that took place last May in Slovakia and was largely dominated by the situation in Ukraine. Then this week, researchers at FireEye, a Silicon Valley firm, released their work detailing a similar campaign by Russian hackers that also targeted NATO, and a long list of victims that included the governments of Georgia, Poland, Hungary, Mexico, Eastern European governments and militaries, and journalists writing on issues of importance to the Russian government. ''This is no smash-and-grab, financially motivated Russian cybercriminal,'' said Laura Galante, the threat intelligence manager who oversaw the research at FireEye. ''This is Russia using their network operations to achieve their key political goals.'' "
The Need for Bank Cyberinsurance,"A high-profile hack at JPMorgan  Chase - to say nothing of monstrous breaches at Sony and Home Depot - has made cybersecurity a daily concern for executives at big banks and corporations. One partial protection is to take out insurance. It's a confusing market, but growing fast. With a United States government campaign on top of all the publicity, coverage may become standard.  The recent break into the internal email servers of Sony Pictures and the subsequent WikiLeaks-like data dump, stated by the F.B.I. to be the work of North Korean hackers opposed to a comedy depicting the assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, may prove costly as well as embarrassing. But the Japanese conglomerate already knows that the failure to secure personal data can be expensive: it shelled out $171 million to cover a 2011 breach of its PlayStation Network. Yet that pales beside the possible fallout for a big bank like JPMorgan, which suffered a hack potentially exposing certain data for up to 83 million accounts. That's where the government is focusing its efforts, with a Treasury official in December publicly urging banks to get insurance. There are dozens of underwriters offering cyber-related cover. It's a market on track to double in 2014, to $2 billion of gross premiums in the United States, according to Marsh & McLennan. The frequency of relevant events ticked up sharply last year to about 10 times the rate a decade ago, according to Advisen, a provider of data and analytics to insurers. Yet there are also dozens of different structures and definitions of insurance on offer. That's where efforts by the banks and Washington may combine to create a bigger, more standardized market for cyberinsurance. That would provide financial cover for at least some of the liabilities arising from hacks. And if the criteria for getting insurance include demonstrating a base level of what Treasury Deputy Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin called ""cyber-hygiene"" then it may also improve security, to a point. But the bad guys are always going to be a step ahead. While governments no doubt want banks to have insurance, part of the motivation may also be to avoid ending up on the hook - just as the Feds have become for terror risks under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which Congress failed to extend before the end of its last session of 2014. The message to banks and insurers may be to get together and figure out coverage. But the companies involved still need to invest in cyberprotection and detection. Whether from North Korea or elsewhere, the threat will only increase in the coming year.  Richard Beales is assistant editor for Reuters Breakingviews.

Blackstone to Acquire Cybersecurity Firm Accuvant,"With the prospect of cyberattacks keeping corporations on edge, the Blackstone Group is investing in a company that aims to counteract such threats. Blackstone, the world's largest private equity firm, announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to buy a majority stake in Accuvant, a 12-year-old company that offers cybersecurity software and consulting services to companies and governments. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.  Sverica International, a private equity firm that owns a stake in Accuvant, is investing alongside Blackstone, according to the announcement. Accuvant's management is also investing in the deal. The investors are betting that the time is right for Accuvant to expand and try to win new customers. Hacking attacks like the recent one at Target are weighing on the minds of many corporate executives. Accuvant, which is based in Denver, tries to stand out from its rivals by acting as an adviser in addition to a software provider. Its clients include the United States government, according to its website. Blackstone has invested in a number of cybersecurity companies over the past couple years, often adopting their services for its own portfolio companies. These investments include Carbon Black (which later merged with Bit9) and iSight Partners, which gave Blackstone's portfolio companies discounted access to its cybersecurity intelligence program last year. But while those investments were for minority stakes, this one stands out because Blackstone is taking control. The deal is expected to close in April, pending regulatory approval. ""With this investment, we are excited to build upon Blackstone's growing information security expertise as the sector becomes increasingly relevant across industries,"" David Johnson, a senior managing director in Blackstone's private equity group, said in a statement. (Mr. Johnson joined Blackstone last year from Dell, where he oversaw corporate strategy.) Blackstone received advice from its own advisory arm and from the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.  "
"In Cybersecurity, Sometimes the Weakest Link Is a Family Member","Since I started writing about cybersecurity, I've developed something of a reputation for paranoia. I set up complex passwords for every website, enable two-step authentication whenever I can, sign up for credit monitoring (thanks to Target) and regularly use secure mobile apps to speak with sensitive sources. I also cover my computer's web camera with a masking tape, and one night - during some paranoia-fraught weeks reporting on Chinese hacking - I even went so far as to move my television out of my bedroom just in case somebody was lurking in my cable box. (In my defense, I'd just covered a case of Chinese hackers lurking in a thermostat and an office printer).  In short, I have become completely obsessive about protecting my personal data. So imagine my reaction the other week when my own father sent a text message containing my Social Security number, driver's license number, birth date, account number, phone number, email address and full name- essentially everything one would need to steal my identity - to people in his address book. Suffice to say, I was not exactly calm, cool and collected. (Full disclosure: I ran this post by my dad who suggested I insert several random nonalphabetic characters to indicate prolific cursing here). It was an honest mistake, of course, but it was infuriating. In his fatherly way, my dad had carefully documented all my most pertinent data in his address book so he could access it for life insurance purposes, then mistakenly sent it to his other contacts. I've taken companies to task for storing personal data and chastised perfect strangers for not setting up password PINs on their phones. But security experts like to say security is only as strong as the weakest link. And in this case, the weakest link - I'm sorry to say - was my dad. The fact is that we all do similar things every day. All it takes is one person clicking on a malicious link, one vendor with a weak password, or one visit to a Chinese takeout restaurant's website for a hacker to gain a foothold into corporate networks. In fact, 91 percent of breaches are attributable to an employee clicking on a link, according to Proofpoint, a computer security company. But the situation for individuals feels helpless. Good password hygiene can only do so much when so much of my most sacred data is being held by insurers, marketers, retailers, banks, and - apparently - my dad. Last year, 13.1 million consumers suffered identity fraud - the second-highest level on record - according to Javelin Strategy & Research. And credit monitoring only provides so much recourse, when your information is lost. Last year, an investigation found that an underground identity theft service, run by a 24-year-old Vietnamese national, had bought its data from an unlikely suspect. As it turned out, Hieu Minh Ngo, who would later be indicted for fraud and identity theft, had bought the data from Experian, one of the three major credit bureaus in the United States, and, perhaps most tragic of all, the very service Target enlisted to offer customers - including yours truly - free credit monitoring. Mr. Ngo pleaded guilty to wire fraud in March and could face as many as 45 years in jail. But to think, he could have saved the trouble and just buddied up to my dad.  "
Recommended Reading: Heartbleed Edition,"Heartbleed Disclosure Timeline: Who Knew What and When? From Fairfax Media, a timeline chronicling the discovery, remedy and celebrity of what would soon become one of the most serious security vulnerabilities in the history of the Internet, CVE-2014-016, known as ""Heartbleed.""  Answering the Critical Question: Can You Get Private SSL Keys Using Heartbleed? One question remained after the threat of Heartbleed emerged: Is it possible to lift SSL keys from a server by exploiting Heartbleed? Neel Mehta, the security researcher at Google who is credited with the discovery of the vulnerability, assured the Twittersphere that it was unlikely. Having done extensive tests, engineers at Cloudflare sought to dispel looming concerns by posing a challenge to the public. They set up an nginx server that was vulnerable to Heartbleed and crowdsourced a worldwide hackathon, inviting volunteers to prove (or disprove) that a private key could indeed be lifted. Cracking Cloudflare's Heartbleed Challenge Several hours after the challenge was issued, Fedor Indutny, a Node.js core developer from Moscow, published a gist proving his possession of the key. The engineering team at Cloudflare soon confirmed his hack as a valid exploit of Heartbleed and declared him the winner. You can find his hack on Github. "
Adding Up the Costs of Data Breaches,"There seems to be an announcement almost weekly that a retailer has been the victim of a cyberattack in which consumer information has been stolen. Has this become the next wave of 21st century white-collar crime as the world of electronic credit and payments opens up companies to more and more thefts of financial information?  The latest disclosure of a possible security breach comes from Michaels Stores, which said it was looking into possible fraudulent activity involving its stores but has not yet confirmed any misuse of customer financial information. As hackers' level of sophistication increases, companies have a harder time even detecting whether computer systems have been attacked and the extent of any security breach.   Unlike many types of white-collar crime that affect only individual companies and markets, a broad swath of society is at risk when hackers obtain personal financial information. As the New York Times reported, Target Corporation was particularly vulnerable to having its system invaded by hackers, who may have exposed credit and debit card information on up to 40 million customers.   Companies that have been attacked are still trying to figure out how quickly to disclose a security breach.Neiman Marcus, for example, sent a letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who had questioned the retailer's failure to promptly notify customers. It gave a timeline of how it was hacked by the same computer program that attacked Target and said it had received information shortly before Christmas about a possible problem with credit cards used at its stores.  A report on New Year's Day confirmed that its computer system had been breached, but the company did not make any public announcement until Jan. 10. On the other hand, Michaels Stores disclosed the potential breach even before it confirmed that financial information had been obtained. In a letter to customers, the company said  that it had ""recently learned of possible fraudulent activity on some U.S. payment cards that had been used at Michaels, suggesting we may have experienced a data security attack."" There is pressure on a company whose information has been stolen to keep quiet and delay disclosures to customers and shareholders. From a law enforcement perspective, keeping a security breach confidential may help criminal investigators track down who received the information and how they may be selling it.  A public announcement of a cyberattack puts the perpetrators on notice to tread more carefully in how they might use customer financial information. The challenge is not finding a crime to prosecute. It is locating the perpetrators and bringing them to the United States to face charges. The malware used to infiltrate computer systems at Target and Neiman Marcus reportedly originated in Russia, and the stolen information has been passed around Eastern Europe. That means that most of those involved in the hacking are beyond the reach of American authorities. There are plenty of criminal laws on the books that can be used to prosecute cybercrime. Federal statutes make it a crime to access a computer to fraudulently obtain information (18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4), and to use ""a means of identification of another person,"" including by selling or trading stolen personal financial information (18 U.S.C. § 1028A). Unlike other types of white-collar crimes, in which defendants often claim they did not believe their conduct constituted a violation, cybercriminals know exactly what they are doing and why. (While technologically sophisticated, they are still just thieves.) So these cases present a different challenge for prosecutors, who often need secrecy to track down those behind the cyberattacks. But the need for a company victimized by hacking to disclose information can be just as great, especially when personal financial information is involved. Although credit card holders are not subject to significant losses if they promptly report fraudulent transactions, that is cold comfort when trying to figure out whether fraudulent charges have been made. If a credit card account is misused, the cardholder has to spend time straightening out unauthorized transactions and dealing with the issuance of new cards. Even more dangerous is the potential for identity theft, which could result in substantial disruptions to an individual's financial life that can take months to fully rectify. For publicly traded companies like Target and Neiman Marcus, there is an additional obligation to disclose material information to shareholders in a timely manner.  For any retailer, a cyberattack may drive customers away and affect income through increased expenses for stronger computer security, providing identity theft protection to affected customers and refunding of any fraudulent charges. The potential impact on the bottom line could be significant, and something every shareholder is likely to want to learn about sooner rather than later. Yet neither Target nor Neiman Marcus have submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission giving an estimate of the potential costs of the hacking they experienced, leaving shareholders in the dark about the impact of these episodes. Companies that have so far avoided the hacking afflicting retailers must be aware of the potential that their computer systems are vulnerable to a cyberattack. At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, the chief executive of Western Union pointed out that dealing with hackers had become a ""street fight."" Hackers are getting more sophisticated, which means the costs to fight them will grow as companies address the type of porous security that got Target into so much trouble. Shareholders are likely to hear more about how companies are trying to protect themselves and the rising cost of doing so.   "
Ways to Protect a PC With Windows 8.1,"Defending A Windows 8 PC Q. I recently purchased a new PC with Windows 8.1 and wondered about the Windows Defender security software -- is it good enough to protect my computer? Should I consider another free service or pay to subscribe to a product like Norton? A. Windows Defender -- which is built into Windows 8 and replaces the free Microsoft Security Essentials program used by earlier versions of Windows -- runs in the background and can help stop spyware, viruses and other malicious software from invading your computer. The program can also scan for malware on demand and automatically updates itself, so it is fairly easy to maintain.  But some evaluations from independent labs like Tom's Guide and AV-TEST in Germany regularly examine most major security products and have found Windows Defender to be weak on defense compared with some other free programs. Microsoft frequently pushes out program updates to help improve its prowess, but if you are concerned, there is nothing to stop you from ditching Defender and switching to a different security suite. Most paid products from Norton, F-Secure, Bitdefender and Avira have additional features (like spam filtering and parental controls along with malware protection), and technical support, and they often perform better than Windows Defender at blocking threats. On the downside, they do cost money and some programs may slightly slow down your PC. Many companies offer free demos of their paid programs, so you can try before you buy. You can also find free stripped-down versions of some programs, like AVG AntiVirus Free, Avast! and Panda Free Antivirus that have received some better reviews than Windows Defender. Displaying a Mac's Connected Devices Q. That little pane on the side of my Mac's Finder window doesn't list certain items I have plugged into the computer (like it used to), namely CDs and USB drives. Is there a way to get them back? A. The list of items that appears in the Sidebar pane of the Mac's Finder window is adjustable, so the missing devices may have been inadvertently turned off at some point. To restore them, click the Mac's desktop, go to the Finder menu and select Preferences. In the Preferences box, click the Sidebar tab. Under the Devices category, you can choose all the items you want to see listed, including discs and USB drives. Within the Sidebar preferences, you can also choose which ''Favorites'' you want to see listed, like your Applications, Documents or Pictures folders. TIP OF THE WEEK Smartphones and tablets have bright color screens, but there are times when they can be a little too bright, like when browsing the web in the dark with other people in the room. If dimming the brightness level does not limit the screen glow, you can often invert the colors temporarily so that the white background with black text becomes a dark black background with white text. In iOS 7, open the Settings icon on the Home screen, then tap General. On the General settings screen, tap Accessibility and turn on the Invert Colors option. Some versions of the Android system can invert the screen colors and some cannot, so check the device's Accessibility options in the Settings; apps that invert the color or offer a ''night mode'' are also available in the Google Play store. If you are mostly reading e-books in the dark on your mobile device, Amazon's Kindle app, Apple's iBooks program, Google Play Books and the apps for the Kobo Reader and Barnes & Noble Nook all have a ''black'' or night-reading mode that easily lets you switch to a background for bedtime reading. Just check the settings within the app to change the background color. J. D.

Report Calls for Better Backstops to Protect Power Grid From Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON -- Despite rising anxiety over the possibility of a cyberattack on the power grid, the industry and government are not set up well to counter the threat, according to a report produced by leading energy security experts. Companies are reluctant to share information with one other, a critical step in reducing vulnerability, because they are afraid of being accused of failing to comply with cybersecurity rules, committing antitrust violations or giving away proprietary information, the report found. And the federal rules intended to protect the electric system from cyberattack are inadequate because they do not give companies an incentive to continually improve and adapt to a changing threat, according to the report, which was released on Friday.  The report was produced by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington nonprofit group, and led by Michael V. Hayden, the former director of the C.I.A.; Curt Hébert Jr., a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and Susan Tierney, a former assistant secretary of energy and former utility regulator in Massachusetts. The experts also found that while the government had focused on the high-voltage power grid, less work has been done on the lower-voltage distribution system, which could cause problems that would propagate up the chain. Cyberwarfare is ''a domain that favors the attacker,'' Mr. Hayden said in a panel discussion on Friday about the report. But he said the United States could reduce its vulnerability and improve its ability to recover. He even quoted a line spoken by John Wayne in the movie ''Sands of Iwo Jima'': ''Life is tough, but it's tougher if you're stupid.'' Most hacking against utilities is done by people trying to steal financial data, including that of customers, but experts fear an act of war, or what Mr. Hayden called ''recreational espionage.'' Not even the public utility commissions are well set up for the new problems, the report said. Regulated utilities can add security costs to the expenses for which they bill their customers, if the regulators find the expenditures ''prudent,'' but ''many regulators lack the expertise to make these judgments,'' the report said. And many entities on the grid are unregulated, in a competitive market, which may make it hard for them to recover their costs. But the report painted cybersecurity in a way that parallels vaccination for disease; wider participation helps both individuals and the community. The report recommended establishing an organization like the one set up after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 by the nuclear industry, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, to conduct peer-to-peer audits, and disseminate best practices. Outside experts who were not involved with the report endorsed some of its findings. Samuel P. Liles, associate professor at Purdue, where he works in the Cyber Forensics Laboratory, said that sharing best practice was ''a hit or a miss,'' although threat information was shared. At the Utilities Telecom Council, a trade association of electric and water utilities, Nadya Bartol, a cybersecurity expert, said the report was correct in asserting that utilities might not always come forward with helpful information. ''If utilities say, 'I have this vulnerability,' they might get fined if that's a violation,'' she said. And they may hesitate to talk about their vulnerabilities because, ''if I put it out in the public space, I will get hacked more.'' The report also raised the issue that public utility commissioners, who decide which utility expenses are ''prudent'' and thus eligible to be passed on to customers, have trouble determining the value of such investments. At the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, a nationwide organization of state commission members, Miles Keogh, the co-author of a paper on evaluating such investments, said commissioners should approach the problem as a management audit, and not get into the details of security. The normal forum for determining prudence, a rate case, ''is ''a great place to argue about stuff, but not to take on terra incognita issues,'' he said. "
"Undermining China, One Knockout at a Time","Tensions between the United States and China over cybersecurity have risen as the two countries continue to trade barbs over hacking. But according to an essay on the website of a state newspaper that was widely republished this week, there is, in fact, a longer-running cyberwar underway between the United States and China. And the weapons employed, the essay argues, are far more sophisticated than hacking. ""America has long used the Internet to poison Chinese civilization and manipulate public opinion to influence politics. Hackers are only the lowest level of this cyberwar,"" reads the essay posted on the website of Guangming Daily, a Communist Party-backed paper aimed at intellectuals. Pointing to ""innumerable articles and writings"" circulating online, the essay argues that the ""highest level"" of this cyberwar has been the insidious advance of American culture, which, it says, has had the effect of ""eroding the moral foundation and self-confidence of the Chinese people.""  Titled ""Nine Knockout Blows in America's Cold War Against China,"" the essay takes on topics including Superman and the American education system. At one point, it even compares the ""indiscriminate smearing"" of China in many ""fabricated or exaggerated"" American news reports to Hitler's treatment of the Jews. The man behind the essay is Zhou Xiaoping, an independent commentator and, in his words, ""everyday Internet user."" Last year, Mr. Zhou wrote another widely distributed essay, in which he lashed out against Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google China, accusing Mr. Lee of faking a cancer diagnosis and favoring the sexual harassment of women. Mr. Zhou was also reportedly involved in a website called Fenbei.com, but he says he left before that website became involved in a pornography scandal. ""As an Internet user living on my country's online territory, how could I not sense, how could I not know, when another country's culture has invaded my country's online territory?"" Mr. Zhou wrote, when reached by email on Wednesday to comment on his essay. ""This is like a real-life war,"" he said. ""I doubt that when Americans were fighting the Civil War, ordinary citizens on both sides didn't know or couldn't sense what kind of weapons or tactics were being used by the other side."" While blustering essays stoking Chinese nationalism are nothing new, Mr. Zhou's piece seems to have enjoyed unusually broad circulation. Since it appeared on Monday on Guangming Daily's website, it has been republished on a number of news sites, including those of the state news agency Xinhua and 81.cn, the official news portal for the Chinese military. Mr. Zhou said that though he had originally written the piece for an online forum a while ago, it was picked up by Guangming Daily only after he posted it on his microblog. Here are some highlights from ""Nine Knockout Blows in America's Cold War Against China"":  "
"In New Pledge, NATO Nations Would Band Together Against Cyberattacks","BRUSSELS -- When President Obama meets with other NATO leaders later this week, they are expected to ratify what seems, at first glance, a far-reaching change in the organization's mission of collective defense: For the first time, a cyberattack on any of the 28 NATO nations could be declared an attack on all of them, much like a ground invasion or an airborne bombing. The most obvious target of the new policy is Russia, which was believed behind computer attacks that disrupted financial and telecommunications systems in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008, and is believed to have used them in the early days of the Ukraine crisis as well.  But in interviews, NATO officials concede that so far their cyberskills are limited at best. While NATO has built a gleaming new computer security center, and now routinely runs computer exercises, it possesses no cyberweapons of its own -- and, apparently, no strategy for how it might use the weapons of member states to strike back in a computer conflict. In fact, its most powerful members, led by the United States and Britain, have spent billions of dollars on secret computer offensive programs -- but they have declined so far to tell NATO leaders what kind of weapons they might contribute in a NATO-led computer conflict. ''Our mandate is pure cyberdefense,'' Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the departing NATO secretary general, said during a visit to Washington over the summer. ''Our declaration is a start,'' he said, ''but I cannot tell you it is a complete strategy.'' NATO's tentative steps into the realm of computer conflict, at a moment when Russian, Chinese and Iranian ''patriotic hackers'' have run increasingly sophisticated campaigns, show the alliance's troubles in innovating to keep up with modern warfare, at a moment when it is also facing one of its greatest political challenges since the end of the Cold War. The change in NATO's definition of an ''armed attack'' will leave deliberately unclear what would constitute a cyberattack so large that the alliance might declare that the action against one of its members could lead to response by the entire alliance under Article V of its charter. ''The judgment will lay with the impact,'' said Douglas E. Lute, the American ambassador to NATO, when he spoke in late July at the Aspen Security Forum. ''Does it look like it will rise to the level of an armed attack?'' Deterrence is all about ambiguity, and the implicit threat that NATO would enter a computer conflict in defense of one of its members is full of those ambiguities. ''They fail to get to the heart of the quintessential question about NATO's cybersecurity obligations,'' Julianne Smith, a former Pentagon official, now at the Center for a New American Security, wrote earlier this year for Chatham House, the British foreign policy center. ''What constitutes an 'attack' and what capabilities might be provided to a member experiencing an attack?'' Here at NATO headquarters, where top officials who were focusing on computer issues for the summit meeting are now preoccupied by Russia's next moves, the mere declaration itself is considered significant progress. It was only after the Estonia attacks that the alliance paid real attention to the threat. Today Estonia, which President Obama will visit starting Tuesday night, has become the crown jewel in NATO's computer defense efforts, the place where cyberstrategy is developed and the site of annual NATO computer security exercises, called ''Locked Shields.'' In interviews, officials said that the declaration that would be ratified this week -- it was already embraced by NATO defense ministers in June -- marks a long-delayed recognition that a NATO nation could be crippled without a shot being fired. In 2010 the NATO council rejected the proposal that a computer attack on a nation's electric grid or its financial systems might prove so damaging it should be considered the equivalent of a conventional, armed attack. (NATO has only invoked Article V -- the declaration that it would come to the aid of a member state -- one time, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, and the Bush administration largely waved away the offer of help.) ''They just weren't ready to think about cyberattacks in 2010,'' recalled Ivo H. Daalder, the American ambassador to NATO during Mr. Obama's first term and now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ''It's a measure of how far we've come on this issue that there's now a consensus that a cyberattack could be as devastating as any other kind of attack, maybe even more so.'' But Mr. Daalder noted that NATO's own ability to defend against computer attacks is ''still pretty basic,'' and it has no ability to execute a ''forward defense'' that involves going into an adversary's computer systems and shutting down an attack. ''They could leave that to member states,'' he said, but would handle it under a NATO chain of command. Yet the NATO members themselves, he noted, may have little understanding of what the United States, Britain or other larger computer powers were able to do. In fact, NATO officials say they have never been briefed on the abilities of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, or those of the Government Communications Headquarters, its British equivalent. Both countries have routinely placed sensors into computers, switching centers and undersea cables for years, as the documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, make clear. The idea is to see an attack massing, and, if the president so ordered, to be able to take out a foreign computer server, or network, to halt an attack. But NATO officials ended up reading press accounts and the Snowden documents in search of an understanding of how the United States conducted computer operations against Iran, or how it monitors hacking units of China's People's Liberation Army. ''If conventional war or nuclear war were to break out,'' one senior NATO official said in an interview here, ''there are detailed plans about how we would respond, and what capabilities are at the disposal of the NATO military structure. We don't have that in the cyberrealm,'' he said, in large part because the United States, Britain and Germany do not want many of the other NATO members to understand what kind of abilities they have.

"Sony, in About-Face, Will Screen 'The Interview' in a Small Run","LOS ANGELES -- ""The Interview,"" the raucous comedy that became the center of a dispute over cybersecurity between the United States and North Korea, will be released in a small number of theaters on Christmas Day after all, Sony Pictures said on Tuesday. The development gave new life to a film that Sony had pulled from distribution last week, after hackers threatened violence against any theater that played it. Sony also left open the door to video-on-demand availability of the movie, either simultaneously with its debut in theaters, or nearly so. In announcing the new plan on Tuesday, Michael Lynton, Sony Pictures' chairman, said his studio was continuing efforts ""to secure more platforms and more theaters so that this movie reaches the largest possible audience."" ""Freedom has prevailed! Sony didn't give up!"" Seth Rogen, who co-directed, co-wrote and co-stars in ""The Interview,"" wrote on Twitter.  A comedy about the assassination of North Korea's ruler, Kim Jong-un, ""The Interview"" was withdrawn by Sony last week after theater chains refused to play it in the face of a terror threat. Though Sony was privately searching for new outlets, the aborted release led to a chorus of protest, as irate Hollywood stars, free-speech advocates and even President Obama complained that Sony had capitulated to extortionist demands to cancel the release. On Friday, hours after the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified North Korea as ""centrally involved"" in a cyberattack of Sony and the subsequent terror threat, Mr. Obama elevated the issue from a serious industry problem to one involving national security and artistic expression. ""We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States,"" Mr. Obama told reporters. Following Mr. Obama's rebuke, Sony stepped up its campaign to secure a release. Mr. Lynton, who had already been searching for alternatives, insisted to CNN and NPR last Friday that the studio had not caved, and that it was scrambling to find new distribution. David Boies, a Sony lawyer, delivered the same message on ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. Over the last day Sony reached out again to the big multiplex operators asking if they would rebook the film, according to people briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because negotiations were continuing. Sony on Tuesday had so far patched together release of ""The Interview"" in about 200 smaller theaters, including the Plaza in Atlanta and roughly 20 venues operated by Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, a chain based in Texas. Some theaters reported near-instant sellouts for Thursday screenings. Still, a run of that size would be largely symbolic in financial terms for Sony, which spent $44 million to make the film and had planned to release it on more than 2,000 North American screens. It appeared unlikely on Tuesday that major exhibitors would come back on board, as security concerns were compounded by anger over Sony's handling of ""The Interview."" North America's four largest chains -- Regal, AMC, Cinemark and Carmike -- either declined to comment or did not respond to queries. Advertising will largely take place on social media. Though modest, the new release plan is a positive turn of events for Mr. Lynton and Amy Pascal, Sony Pictures' co-chairwoman, who were battered for canceling the release. But the decision to move ahead with limited distribution begins a new period of disquiet for the studio and its partners. The hacker group that digitally ransacked Sony and threatened theaters with violence had warned that a digital assault would resume if new distribution plans were made. In addition to the furor over ""The Interview,"" Sony has suffered the disclosure of tens of thousands of emails, personnel files and other private data since Nov. 24. Mr. Obama said the United States would take action in response to the Sony attack, leading North Korea, which has denied responsibility, to warn of ""serious consequences"" if the United States made any such move. Theater owners and government officials have been trying to assess the credibility of the terrorism threat, which came on Dec. 16 and warned of 9/11-scale violence if ""The Interview"" was released. Initially, the F.B.I. had guided theaters to treat the missive like a bomb threat -- credible until it could be proved otherwise. But law enforcement agencies have in recent days softened that assessment, according to people briefed on the matter. The art-house theaters showing the film might still take unusual security measures, perhaps by banning backpacks or packages or posting signs advising customers of added risk, said people briefed on their plans. Even so, the theaters taking ""The Interview"" face security issues less severe than any that multiplexes would have come up against. Many of America's 500 or so art houses, for instance, are located away from shopping malls; mall operators initially objected to the showing of a film under explicit threat. Keeping ""The Interview"" away from multiplexes would also reduce any collateral damage for Sony competitors, some of whom aggressively pushed exhibitors to drop the film to protect ticket sales for their holiday releases. Competing studios had privately argued that, even if the threat was not credible, having ""The Interview"" on theater marquees could prompt ticket buyers to stay away, hurting films playing in the same complex. A new facet of Sony's discussions with theater owners is any simultaneous video-on-demand effort. Studios typically give theaters an exclusive monthslong window to play new movies. Most theaters, worried about the impact on ticket sales, remain adamant about refusing to open their doors to any film that is showing or about to show through other channels. It remained unclear, however, whether any on-demand service would take ""The Interview."" According to people briefed on the matter, Sony had in recent days asked the White House for help in lining up a single technology partner -- Apple, which operates iTunes -- but the tech company was not interested, at least not on a speedy time table. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. On Tuesday, Eric Schultz, a White House press secretary, said that Mr. Obama welcomed the decision to release the film. ""As the president made clear, we're a country that believes in free speech and the right of artistic expression,"" he said. Finding a new delivery route has been complicated. Satellite operators, cable systems and online platforms worried that they would become hacking targets if they picked up the film. The studio early on ruled out its own video site, Crackle. That streaming service is free, and Sony has a contractual financial obligation to various profit participants in ""The Interview"" to exhaust all paid options. YouTube was eliminated as an option for the same reason, among others. A spokesman for LStar Capital, which helped finance ""The Interview,"" declined to comment. Unclear on Tuesday was precisely how Sony arrived at the decision to mount a limited theatrical release. A group called Art House Convergence may have played a role; on Monday it told Sony it had found about 250 small theaters willing to play the film. Amy Chozick contributed reporting from Kailua, Hawaii. Related Articles  "
2 Regulators Issue Guidelines on Sharing Cyber Security Information,"WASHINGTON - Sharing information between companies about threats to cybersecurity is not likely to raise antitrust concerns, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission said Thursday. In a new policy document that describes their stance, the regulators outlined ways in which the sharing of cyber-threat information differs from the sharing of competitive information, such as pricing data and business plans.   ""Cyber threats are increasing in number and sophistication, and sharing information about these threats, such as incident reports, indicators and threat signatures, is something companies can do to protect their information systems,"" said Bill Baer, an assistant attorney general in charge of Justice's antitrust division. The regulators previously issued guidelines on the sharing of information about cyber threats in October 2000 in a business review letter to the Electric Power Research Institute. The regulators have relied on that opinion ever since, but only now turned it into a formal policy. In February 2013, in the wake of an increasing number of cyberattacks and theft of consumers' personal data, President Obama  issued an executive order urging the use of the safe harbor and ensuring that privacy and civil liberties protections are in place. According to a recent study by Risk Based Security, there were more than 2,000 data security breaches in 2013. Justice Department officials also emphasized that companies should inform the government about cyber threats. Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole called on Congress to enact new laws governing the reporting of cybersecurity issues, including a duty to inform federal agencies of such a threat. ""Companies must recognize the need to share with the government, because it is through such sharing that the government is able to help companies most quickly and effectively address intrusions and to help prevent future attacks,"" Mr. Cole said.  Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman of the F.T.C., which shares jurisdiction over competition issues with the Justice Department, said the policy was designed to stem reluctance among companies to share information about the type and scope of cybersecurity threats. ""This statement should help private businesses,"" Ms. Ramirez said, ""by making it clear that antitrust laws do not stand in the way of legitimate sharing of cybersecurity threat information.""    "
Questions Remain After Chinese Hacking Indictments,"The indictments of five Chinese military hackers by the Justice Department on Monday has raised questions of what actions, if any, American officials plan to take against members of the more than 20 other hacking units that American officials and their partners are currently tracking inside China. ""If you look at all the groups that we track in China, this is just the very tip of the iceberg,"" said George Kurtz, a co-founder of Crowdstrike, a private security firm that has been tracking the People's Liberation Army Unit 61398 and other hacking groups in China. ""The indictments are just one piece of a broader puzzle.""  Beyond Unit 61398, the National Security Agency and its intelligence partners are currently tracking more than 20 Chinese hacking groups - over half of them Chinese military and naval units - as they break into an array of American government agencies and companies, ranging from drone and nuclear weapon parts makers to technology, retail and energy firms and nonprofit research organizations, according to a half-dozen United States officials who declined to be named because of the classified and ongoing nature of the investigations. Security officials said that the indictments were intended to push China to get serious about reining in various P.L.A. hacking units and that they have been in the works for two years. One of the major challenges, officials said, was persuading the victim corporations - which feared a loss of sales in China or state retaliation - to come forward. ""They had to gather really strong evidence that these companies had been hacked, and then had to convince the companies to go public, despite fear of retaliation,"" said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, who has participated in several official Sino-American discussions on cyberespionage. The indictments, Mr. Lewis said, are not about what the United States will do with these hackers, but what the Chinese government will do with them. ""The indictment is meant to send a clear public message to China that they need to take action,"" he said. ""They need to get these P.L.A. entities under control."" While the majority of the groups the N.S.A. has been tracking, including Unit 61398, are P.L.A. units, officials say many of them are murky collectives of hackers from privately owed Chinese companies and state-funded universities that officials believe have been contracted by the Ministry of State Security, China's civilian spy agency, to hack victims - such as clean energy firms - that help China meet its economic objectives. Officials say it is unclear how the Chinese government tasks such missions, a quandary that has taken on more urgency after analysts were able to trace sophisticated cyberattacks against a disconcerting list of victims - drone and missile makers and nuclear technology developers among them - to three privately contracted groups of Chinese hackers. Officials say one of these privately contracted groups, based in Guangzhou, China, has been tied to attacks against defense contractors - including missile, satellite and space technologies and nuclear propulsion technology developers - in the United States, Britain and Russia. More recently, two officials said that the group has expanded its targets to include law firms, which hold valuable intellectual property for their clients but often lack the security defenses of a larger corporation. Separately, officials say, the N.S.A. and its partners have been tracking a group of privately employed technology workers based in the industrial city of Tianjin. Since 2005, officials say, they have tied attacks on defense contractors and technology and energy firms, as well as Chinese separatists, to the group. One of these groups of privately employed Chinese hackers that have officials most concerned is also one of the least prolific.<<< Since 2008, officials say members of this group have surgically struck a number of companies that develop drones and satellite technology. Officials say that they believe these groups work at the behest of the Ministry of State Security and that the fact that they are contracted but not directly employed by the state gives Beijing a degree of deniability. But the vast majority of groups the N.S.A. and its partners are tracking are units of the People's Liberation Army's Second and Third Departments, which maintain eavesdropping posts across China. They say Unit 61398 - formally the Second Bureau of the People's Liberation Army's Third Department - accounts for only a slice of the attacks orchestrated by the P.L.A.'s Third Department. According to interviews with three former government officials, the N.S.A. began tracking the PLA's Third Department in 2004 after its First Bureau hacked into the Pentagon's networks, two former government officials said. Since then, the unit has been tied to numerous cyberattacks on foreign telecom and technology companies that specialize in networking and encryption equipment, like the types manufactured by American companies including Cisco, Juniper and Broadcom. Judging by their victims, officials say other P.L.A. bureaus are assigned to targets - including politicians and diplomats at government agencies - in specific geographies. For example, one P.L.A. bureau has been tied to several attacks against diplomats and politicians in South Asia, while another has been linked to attacks on targets in Central Asia, including the foreign ministries of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. Officials also say that thousands of attacks against the military networks of the United States and a number of Asian countries, including South Korea and Japan, have been  attributed to the Chinese Navy's First and Second Technical Reconnaissance Bureaus. After Monday's indictments, American officials say that they will be looking to see what, if any, steps Beijing takes to curb cyberespionage. ""A lot of this will depend on how the Chinese react to this in private,"" said Mr. Lewis, the cybersecurity expert. ""If they blow this off, you could imagine actions by the Treasury, visa restrictions on travel or restrictions on study."" He added: ""The Chinese have more to lose in this than we do.""  "
"Charges of Chinese Cyberspying, Wanted Posters Included","A United States indictment accusing members of China's military of computer hacking against American companies has put a face on a practice the Obama administration has long complained of, the use of state cyberwarfare capabilities to steal corporate secrets. While little is publicly known about the five indicted members of the People's Liberation Army, the F.B.I. has released photos and aliases of the men accused of being members of the Chinese military's computer espionage Unit 61398, also known as the ""Comment Crew."" The members of the Shanghai-based unit went by online handles such as ""UglyGorilla,"" ""WinXYHappy"" and ""KandyGoo."" With the announcement on Monday of the 31-count indictment filed at a federal court in Pittsburgh, the five were placed at the top of the F.B.I. ""Cyber's Most Wanted"" list. They were shown in ""Wanted by the F.B.I."" posters, a nearly century-old practice of telling the public whom law enforcement officers are trying hardest to capture. But unlike other wanted posters, those produced for the five hacking suspects reveal little beyond their names and aliases. It was not clear how the photos of the men, two of whom are shown in military uniform, were obtained.  As Michael S. Schmidt and David E. Sanger write, the charges were ""almost certainly symbolic since there is virtually no chance that the Chinese would turn over the five People's Liberation Army members named in the indictment."" The ""Comment Crew"" was outlined publicly last year in a report by the United States-based security firm Mandiant, which said a building off Datong Road in Shanghai was most likely a P.L.A. cyberspying headquarters because of the large number of attacks that emerged from there. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the indictment. A ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said the case was ""based on fabricated facts, grossly violates the basic norms governing international relations and jeopardizes China-U.S. cooperation and mutual trust,"" according to a statement posted on the ministry's website. The ministry said it summoned the United States ambassador to China, Max Baucus, Monday evening to register its complaints regarding the legal case. It also said that China would suspend its participation in a United States-China working group on cybersecurity. China's Ministry of National Defense also condemned the indictment, saying ""the Chinese government and military have never engaged or participated in any theft of commercial secrets over the Internet,"" according to a statement posted on its website on Tuesday. It accused the United States of ""hypocrisy and double standards"" and said that WikiLeaks and the revelations of the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden had shown that the United States has the technology and capabilities ""to carry out large-scale, organized cybertheft, bugging and monitoring against foreign politicians, businesses and individuals."" In a news analysis, David E. Sanger writes that the Obama administration is drawing a fine line between hacking done for national security purposes and that done for commercial gain, a division that is not recognized by China. And the United States does not always respect that line, either, Mr. Sanger writes: Even before Mr. Snowden walked out of the Hawaii facilities of the N.S.A. with a trove of documents, it was clear that the United States was not above economic espionage, as long as it was not for the direct benefit of specific companies. For example, the United States spies regularly for economic advantage when the goal is to support trade talks; when the Clinton administration was locked in a high-stakes negotiation in the 1990s to reach an accord with Japan, it bugged the Japanese negotiator's limousine. At the time, the chief beneficiaries would have been the Big Three auto companies and a smattering of parts suppliers. It is also widely believed to be using intelligence in support of trade negotiations underway with European and Asian trading partners. But in the view of a succession of Democratic and Republican administrations, that is fair game. Companies can also be targets. Documents released by Mr. Snowden showed that the American government pried deep into the servers of Huawei, one of China's most successful Internet and communications companies. The documents made clear that the N.S.A. was seeking to learn whether the company was a front for the People's Liberation Army and whether it was interested in spying on American firms. But there was a second purpose: to get inside Huawei's systems and use them to spy on countries that buy the company's equipment. The indictment lists Westinghouse Electric, SolarWorld, United States Steel Corporation, Alcoa and Allegheny Technologies as the companies targeted by the hackers along with a labor union, the United Steelworkers, which had encouraged the United States to pursue trade cases against China. The indictment does not specify the Chinese state-owned enterprises that would have benefited, listing them simply as SOE-1, SOE-2 and SOE-3. However, descriptions of the cases give strong signals as to their identities.  The indictment says that Westinghouse signed a contract to construct four reactors in China for SOE-1 on or around 2007, which coincides with the American nuclear power plant builder's contract to build reactors for the China National Nuclear Corporation, or C.N.N.C.  The State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation, which is partly owned by C.N.N.C., contracted with Westinghouse on the project, indicating that it or C.N.N.C. is most likely SOE-1. Allegheny Technologies Inc., or A.T.I., had a joint venture with SOE-2, according to the indictment, and A.T.I. and the Chinese company were also involved in litigation before the World Trade Organization, both of which describe A.T.I.'s relationship with the Chinese steel maker Baosteel. SOE-3 is probably the Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chinalco. The indictment says that in 2001 Alcoa entered into a partnership with a Chinese aluminum company to purchase shares, which would have been Chalco. The indictment raises further questions about the United States' strategy in pursuing such a public case, Nicole Perlroth writes, and whether the legal challenge will be expanded:  Beyond Unit 61398, the National Security Agency and its intelligence partners are currently tracking more than 20 Chinese hacking groups - over half of them Chinese military and naval units - as they break into an array of American government agencies and companies, ranging from drone and nuclear weapon parts makers to technology, retail and energy firms and nonprofit research organizations, according to a half-dozen United States officials who declined to be named because of the classified and ongoing nature of the investigations. While most of those hacking groups are military units, they include private companies and academic institutions, Ms. Perlroth writes, and the ways they are organized and contracted are far from clear.

"China Attack Aims at iCloud, Apple's Service for Storage","Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Nicole Perlroth and Brian X. Chen from San Francisco. HONG KONG -- For Apple in China, trouble seems to be the new normal. Cybersecurity monitoring groups and security experts said on Monday that people trying to use Apple's online data storage service, known as iCloud, were the target of a new attack that sought to steal users' passwords and then spy on their activities. Starting over the weekend, when many users across China tried to sign into their iCloud accounts, they may have been giving away login information to a third party, in what is called a man-in-the-middle attack.  ''You think you are getting information directly from Apple, but in fact the authorities are passing information between you and Apple, and snooping on it the whole way,'' said a spokesman for an independent censorship-monitoring website, GreatFire, who declined to be named because of fear of reprisal. The back-end I.P. address targeted by the attack was changed Tuesday by Apple, according to a tweet from GreatFire. News of the vulnerability came just as the new iPhone 6 arrived in Chinese stores after a monthlong regulatory delay tied, in part, to concerns about the phone's security. Activists and security experts say they believe the attacks are backed by the Chinese government because they are hosted from servers to which only the government and state-run telecommunications companies have access, according to GreatFire. They are also similar to recent attacks on Google, Yahoo and Microsoft aimed at monitoring what users were retrieving on the sites. ''All signs point to the Chinese government's involvement,'' said Michael Sutton, vice president for threat research at Zscaler, a San Jose, Calif., security company. ''Evidence suggests this attack originated in the core backbone of the Chinese Internet and would be hard to pull off if it was not done by a central authority like the Chinese government.'' The targeting also potentially reveals a new Chinese government effort to adapt to initiatives by Internet companies -- most notably new encryption techniques -- to protect user data from government spying. ''The Chinese government could no longer sniff traffic, so they intercepted that traffic between the browser and the iCloud server,'' Mr. Sutton said. Chinese officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Many web browsers, like Apple's Safari, Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox, flashed a warning to users that a so-called encryption certificate that is supposed to identify who is on the other end of a web session should not be trusted. That indicated that users were inadvertently communicating with the attackers, rather than iCloud. In effect, the hackers stepped into the middle of the online conversation. Mr. Sutton noted that Qihoo, a browser offered by the Qihoo 360 Technology Company that is popular in China, did not flash a warning to users. ''As more sites move to encryption by default -- which prevents the censorship authorities from selectively blocking access to content -- the Chinese authorities will grow increasingly frustrated with their ability to censor that content,'' said the GreatFire spokesman. ''In some ways their hands are being forced. They can attempt these man-in-the-middle attacks or choose to outright block access to these sites. The more sites they block, the more they cut off the Chinese populace from the global Internet,'' he added. The timing of the attack, aligned with the release of the new iPhone in China, is a potential indicator that the government is trying to harvest sign-in data from a large number of users who are switching over to the iPhone 6. The new phone comes with better encryption to protect against government snooping. In September, Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said its latest operating system, iOS 8, included protections that made it impossible for the company to comply with government warrants asking for customer information like photos, emails and call history. The change prompted the Federal Bureau of Investigation director, James B. Comey, to say in a recent speech that new encryption by Apple and others ''will have very serious consequences for law enforcement and national security agencies at all levels.'' ''Sophisticated criminals will come to count on these means of evading detection,'' Mr. Comey said. In August, Apple began storing data for iCloud on servers in China in a move it said was intended to enhance performance of the service there. The company said the state-owned service provider China Telecom, which owns the servers where the data is stored, did not have access to the content. But security experts say it appears that Beijing has found a workaround, by coordinating man-in-the-middle attacks on a mass scale. Apple on Tuesday acknowledged a network attack, but clarified that its iCloud servers were not breached. On a security webpage, it implied that man-in-the-middle attacks were being used to direct people to fake connections of iCloud.com, making their user names and passwords vulnerable to theft. On the webpage, Apple explained how people could distinguish an authentic iCloud.com site from a fake one. Basically, users will receive warnings when the browser detects a fake certificate or an untrusted connection. Apple advised people to heed those warnings and avoid signing in. ''Apple is deeply committed to protecting our customers' privacy and security,'' said Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman. ''We're aware of intermittent organized network attacks using insecure certificates to obtain user information, and we take this very seriously.'' Ms. Muller declined to comment on whether Apple had identified the Chinese government as the source of the attacks. Security experts said users should not visit websites if they receive a browser warning. Mr. Sutton also advised users to turn on two-factor authentication whenever possible, a procedure in which a user is prompted to enter a second one-time password that has been texted to the user's phone. That way, he said, even if an attacker intercepts a password, they cannot use it to log into a site without the second password. ''Users should treat this seriously,'' Mr. Sutton said. "
White House Puts Out Critical Infrastructure Security Guide," Remember that cybersecurity bill that failed to pass two years ago? Not many people do. The bill failed largely because John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona, the United States Chamber of Commerce and others opposed it on grounds that it would be too onerous for the private sector.  The failed bill was intended to do two things. One, it would have provided for information-sharing about cyberthreats between the government and the private sector. Two, it would have set minimum security standards for the companies that oversee the nation's critical infrastructure like dams, electrical grids, mobile towers and financial institutions. The bill ended in a Republican filibuster in August 2012, forcing the White House to issue a watered-down executive order last year. The order made it voluntary for companies that oversee critical infrastructure to join an experimental cyberthreat sharing program, and also set up recommendations - a far cry from mandatory standards - that companies can follow to prevent attacks. On Wednesday, The National Institute of Standards and Technology, the federal agency charged with recommending cybersecurity standards, introduced those guidelines in a Cybersecurity Framework. The framework essentially offers companies a blueprint for how to identify their risk to cyberattacks, protect against them and detect intrusions as they occur. It also offers guidance for how to respond and recover from an attack. But the framework is voluntary and the agency that released it Wednesday is under intense scrutiny from privacy activists, cryptographers and many in the security industry. Classified documents disclosed by Edward J. Snowden last summer made clear that N.I.S.T. issued an encryption standard in 2006 that included a backdoor for the National Security Agency.  "
Neiman Marcus Data Breach Worse Than First Said,"The theft of consumer data from Neiman Marcus appears far deeper than had been disclosed originally, with the luxury retailer now saying that hackers invaded its systems for several months in a breach that involved 1.1 million credit and debit cards. The malware installed on terminals in Neiman Marcus stores seems to be the same malware that infiltrated Target's systems and exposed information from as many as 110 million customers, according to a person briefed on the investigations who spoke on the condition of anonymity and is not authorized to speak publicly about the attacks. Investigators have not revealed whether the same cybercriminals are suspected in both breaches, although investigators and security specialists have described a loose band of hackers from Eastern Europe as the likeliest suspects in the Target theft. Security specialists working with the authorities have said that the hackers were considering several major retailers as potential targets. In a statement posted on its website Wednesday night, Neiman Marcus said that the malware had been ''clandestinely'' put into its system and had stolen payment data off cards used from July 16 to Oct. 30. MasterCard, Visa and Discover have told the company that about 2,400 cards used at Neiman Marcus and its Last Call outlet stores have since been used fraudulently.  The Neiman Marcus Group, which also owns Bergdorf Goodman, has said it was not aware of the data theft until mid-December, when a payment processor reported that unauthorized charges were showing up on cards used at its stores. It now plans to notify all customers who shopped in those stores from January 2013 to this month -- and for whom the company has a mailing or email address. Like Target, it said it would offer those shoppers one free year of credit monitoring. In the instances of widespread data theft at Target and Neiman Marcus, the malware was designed to hook into cash registers to monitor the credit card authorization process. Before a transaction can be authorized, credit card data is momentarily decrypted and stored in memory. Called RAM-scraping malware, it is built to scrape that unencrypted data from memory and steal it, according to a private report issued by iSight Partners, which is working with the Department of Homeland Security to investigate the retail attacks. The data thefts have reignited a push for more secure credit and debit cards, similar to those used in Europe and elsewhere, and have prompted some congressional committees and senators to renew calls for tougher consumer protections. In addition to an investigation of the breach by the Secret Service, the Justice Department and several state attorneys general, the Senate Judiciary Committee has asked Target for documents related to its cybersecurity efforts and the malware used in the attack. Target's chief financial officer, John J. Mulligan, will be the first witness to appear before the committee at a hearing on Feb. 4. Federal authorities also are expected to testify. Since the Target breach in November, the attention of retailers and the card industry has turned to EMV technology, named for its founders, Eurocard, MasterCard and Visa. Cards using the technology have a small chip embedded that creates a new code for each transaction, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit the cards in the way that has happened since card numbers were stolen from Target. ''EMV wouldn't have stopped it, but it would have helped minimize the impact after the event,'' according to Don Tait, an analyst at IHS. The United States is one of the last countries to move toward the technology. In Europe, 81 percent of the cards have EMV chips, according to the consulting firm Celent. Countries that have adopted the technology have seen a sharp decline in credit card fraud. In Britain the amount of fraud per transaction has dropped 57 percent since 2002. Meanwhile, fraud has risen sharply in the United States, some 70 percent between 2004 and 2010, Celent information shows. While the United States accounts for only 27 percent of the credit card transactions in the world, it is responsible for 47 percent of card fraud, according to data from the Nilson Report, a newsletter about the payment industry. ''The rest of the world is onto new technology, and we're still using magnetic stripe technology that was used for eight track tape players in the 1960s,'' Chris McWilton, a MasterCard executive, said on Thursday. ''No wonder the fraudsters have found us.'' The United States has not moved faster because retailers and card issuers have worried that the cost of adopting the technology, usually estimated at $15 billion to $30 billion, would be more than the cost of the fraud it prevented. Even with increasing fraud in the United States, it has only cost about 5 cents for every $100 of credit card use. The main proponents of change have been the major card companies. Visa, MasterCard and American Express have all said that American retailers need to install hardware that can read EMV cards by October 2015. Any retailers that do not, and have data stolen, will be liable for the costs of any fraud. In the last year, retailers complained frequently about the costs of shifting to another technology. In October, a Visa executive hinted that the company was listening to the retailers and considering revising its schedule. Regulatory changes, meanwhile, have muddied the waters of how chip technology could be applied uniformly. ''There was a clear apathy in the industry,'' said Zilvinas Bareisis, a card analyst at Celent, said of the retailers' reluctance. But now, many players, including the Target chief executive Gregg W. Steinhafel, have talked about the importance of moving to EMV. In a letter this month, MasterCard told its clients it was recommitting itself to making the transition happen by 2015. ''It's been a wake-up call,'' Mr. McWilton said in an interview. ''There were a lot of naysayers and people satisfied with the status quo. Now, I think, people have woke up and said, 'If you don't have the public trust, you don't have the business.' '' Investors are betting that the revived interest in new technology will lead to changes. The stock of companies that would manufacture some of the new technology has been pushed up since the Target breach. Verifone, the most prominent manufacturer of payment hardware, is up 27 percent over the last month. But card issuers have been careful to point out that cards with chips will not stamp out all fraud. The chips do not prevent card numbers for being used fraudulently online, and in Britain that sort of crime has risen even while overall fraud has dropped. On that front, many financial firms have been pushing the idea of tokenization, which creates a new code for each transaction, making it hard to use the same card repeatedly. Mr. Bareisis said it could be a problem if the United States adopted only one part of the antifraud technology available. Recently, smaller instances of customer data theft have surfaced at other retailers, as well. Nordstrom said it found skimming devices on 10 registers at a store in Miami in October, which stripped information like account numbers and expiration dates off cards. (A company spokeswoman said that the attack appeared to have been confined to just those machines and that the company had no evidence its system was breached.) And this week, Easton-Bell Sports said 6,000 people who shopped at its online store in December had their information compromised, including names, email addresses, credit card numbers or card security codes. Criminal demand for the kind of point-of-sale malware used in the attacks on Target and Neiman Marcus has been steadily growing. Security specialists say cybercriminals will post advertisements on online freelancing sites looking for help in developing point-of-sale malware. Last July, on a popular freelancing site, security researchers at iSight Partners found that more than 20 percent of all ads appeared to be from criminals looking to hire hackers with expertise in point-of-sale systems. And hackers that have expertise in point-of-sale systems have been increasing their rates. Early in 2010, hackers were charging $425 to $2,500 for point-of-sale malware projects. By the end of the year, their rates had spiked to $6,500, according to a report prepared by iSight Partners Though most point-of-sale malware developers are based in Eastern Europe, security researchers say that cybercriminals in Brazil have been developing and using point-of-sale malware since at least 2009. "
Target Says Hackers Used a Vendor's Credentials,"WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said Wednesday that the Justice Department was committed to finding the hackers behind the holiday season theft of credit card data from millions of Target customers.  The same day, Target said that hackers were able to get into the company's system using a vendor's credentials. ''We can confirm that the ongoing forensic investigation has indicated that the intruder stole a vendor's credentials which were used to access our system,'' Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman, said in an email. ''Since that time we have taken extra precautions such as limiting or updating access to some of our platforms while the investigation continues.'' Mr. Holder's remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee were the first official confirmation that the Justice Department was investigating the data theft. ''We are committed to working to find not only the perpetrators of these sorts of data breaches, but also any individuals and groups who exploit that data via credit card fraud,'' Mr. Holder said. Officials have said hackers in Eastern Europe inserted malicious computer code into the in-store systems where Target consumers swipe their credit and debit cards and enter their PINs. The theft, over Thanksgiving weekend and into the following weeks of holiday deals, involved the credit and debit card data of as many as 40 million Target customers, and personal information, such as phone numbers and addresses, of as many as 70 million more. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Cybercrime Scheme Uncovered in Brazil,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Security researchers have uncovered what they believe is a significant cybercrime operation in Brazil that took aim at $3.75 billion in transactions by Brazilians. It is unclear what percentage of the $3.75 billion worth of compromised transactions was actually stolen. But if even half of that value was redirected to criminals, the scope of the swindle would eclipse any other previous electronic theft. The thieves preyed on Boleto Bancário, or Boletos, a popular Brazilian payment method that can be issued online and paid through various channels like banks and supermarkets, said researchers at the RSA Security division of the EMC Corporation.  Researchers said the ring had been using what they called bolware -- a play on Boletos and malware, a term for software intended for illegitimate purposes -- to intercept legitimate Boletos payments and redirect them to the accounts of criminals or mules, who are people paid to stand in for the criminals. Boletos can be used for every kind of transaction, from telephone bills and health insurance premiums to mortgages and school tuition. Over six billion were issued last year, according to Brazil's central bank. In a country where many lack bank accounts and do not trust the postal service enough to send checks by mail, it is common to see long lines at banks as Brazilians carry their Boletos to pay their bills. Bolware was first detected in 2012, but this is the first time that security researchers have been able to trace bolware to a single criminal ring and determine the scope of compromised transactions. RSA researchers in Brazil, Israel and the United States studied 19 variants of bolware for three months. Using digital logs, they were able to trace the bolware to what they believe is one group in Brazil. Based on the logs, researchers determined that 192,227 victims had been affected and 495,793 Boletos transactions worth $3.75 billion were hit. ''Cybercrime is a lot more rampant in Brazil than it is in the United States, and in many ways Brazil has been the trendsetter in cybercrime,'' said Avivah Litan, a cybersecurity analyst at Gartner. Cybercrime accounts for 95 percent of losses incurred by Brazilian banks, according to the Brazilian Federation of Banks, or Febraban. Brazil also has a large online population -- about 107 million people, or more than 50 percent of the country's population -- and in 2012 an estimated $1.4 billion was lost to electronic fraud, according to Febraban. Now, researchers say Boletos fraud has become a serious threat to banks in Brazil. After briefing Febraban on RSA's findings, Uri Fleyder, a researcher for RSA based in Israel, said in an interview Monday that while Boletos fraud was a known issue, ''No one realized it was on this scope.'' Febraban officials said they could not comment on a continuing police investigation but noted that Brazilian banks last year spent $910 million on digital security and that they were encouraging consumers to migrate from Boletos to a more secure, fully electronic payment system called Direct Debit Authorization, or D.D.A. Boletos are an enticing target because they are so common. The criminals infected PCs by sending emails with malicious links and attachments that, once clicked, downloaded the bolware onto a computer. The bolware burrowed into the Windows operating system of a computer and worked through Internet browsers -- including Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox and Microsoft's Internet Explorer -- where it modified Boletos transactions and redirected payments directly to the accounts of criminals. The bolware also collected users' email credentials, most likely so more malicious emails could be sent to infect more computers. RSA researchers said they had also briefed the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Secret Service and were working with local and international law enforcement officials to help prosecute the individuals behind the ring. The current assumption is that the group has ties to organized crime in Brazil, but Mr. Fleyder cautioned that for now, that was just an assumption. Because the bolware affects only Windows PC users, researchers are advising PC users to take extra precautions before clicking on suspicious links or email attachments and to make Boletos payments using only the digital wallets on their mobile devices. But the best advice, Mr. Fleyder offered, was simply to ''be vigilant.'' "
"As More Documents Appear, Sony Seeks to Calm Nervous Employees","LOS ANGELES -- As hackers made public more Sony Pictures Entertainment documents on Monday, Sony sought to calm its jittery employees, announcing in an internal memo that the F.B.I. would visit its Culver City, Calif., lot on Wednesday for security briefings.  In a companywide email sent on Monday afternoon, Michael Lynton, the studio's chief executive, told staff members that the F.B.I. had dedicated ''senior staff'' to the global hacking investigation, which has been described by cybersecurity experts as ''unprecedented and highly sophisticated.'' Sony employees over the past week have seen their Social Security numbers, performance reviews, salaries, home addresses and passwords shared with the world. In addition to the F.B.I. visit on Wednesday, Mr. Lynton announced an all-hands gathering on Friday to brief employees on the latest information regarding the attack. Earlier on Monday, a note appeared online that for the first time appeared to link the leaking of thousands of documents over the last week to the coming Sony comedy ''The Interview,'' about a bumbling assassination attempt on North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un. ''Stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism,'' the note said in part, although it did not specifically identify ''The Interview'' as that movie. The posting was apparently made by Guardians of Peace, a hacker group that has claimed responsibility for the attack. Investigators are pursuing a theory that Sony's attackers may have had help from at least one Sony employee, according to security experts who have studied samples of the malware found on Sony's systems but are bound by agreements not to speak publicly about it. Embedded into the malware were the names of several internal Sony servers, and credentials for its employees, according to the security experts. Evidence suggests the attackers routed their attack through infected computers in Thailand, Italy, Singapore, Poland, Bolivia and Cyprus, but the code was written on computers that used the Korean language settings by default. The attacks also bear remarkable similarity to a series of destructive attacks last year on banks and broadcasters in South Korea. North Korea has denied involvement in the Sony attacks, but released a statement Sunday acknowledging that the attack might be a ''righteous deed'' of hackers sympathetic with North Korea. "
Challenges Old and New for Jamie Dimon,"Jamie Dimon is back in the saddle after battling cancer - just in time for the JPMorgan boss to face challenges old and new. Overall results in the third quarter released on Tuesday missed estimates thanks to rising costs. Its investment bank is punching below its weight. Cybersecurity is a growing worry. Even the timing of the bank's earnings was off.  That, at least, doesn't look like it was JPMorgan's fault. Instead,shareholder.com, a Nasdaq unit, simply released one of the bank's documents a couple of hours early. Nonetheless, it's hardly an auspicious start to earnings season for a bank or an industry that has already displayed a penchant for procedural mishaps - and worse. Increased expenses, though, are a concern. The bank is now likely to miss its $58 billion target for the year. That's in part the result of a $1 billion legal charge in the three months to September, much of which is the firm's best estimate for what it might have to hand over to settle its share of an industry-wide investigation into foreign exchange shenanigans. These payouts are, at least, declining for JPMorgan. The cost of combating cyberattacks, though, is on the rise. The bank was recently assailed by hackers who managed to compromise personal information - though no data on account or Social Security numbers - on 76 million households and seven million small businesses. At a conference last week Mr. Dimon said that he was doubling the budget to deal with such threats to $500 million. Just how much higher that might need to go is anyone's guess. But banks are not just affected by their own security problems. JPMorgan's third-quarter showing was hurt by the lender's exposure to a more consequential data breach at Home Depot over the summer. On top of that, low interest rates are keeping earnings depressed. And the bank's loan-to-deposits ratio now stands at a low 56 percent. Meanwhile, its investment bank could do with a jolt. Sure, its annualized return on equity of 14 percent for the quarter, excluding legal costs, might sound good. But the unit has some advantages not all its rivals do. It rakes in far more revenue than Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley from trading fixed income securities and currencies - in part thanks to extra business from treasury services, a solid business less prone to market vagaries that now sits in the investment bank. And the entire division's compensation ratio, at 32 percent, is the lowest of its peers. Were Goldman's pay to be that low, its return on equity in the first half of the year would have been 4 percentage points higher, beating JPMorgan's. That, at least, is more of a luxury problem to solve. Nonetheless, Mr. Dimon has his work cut out.  Antony Currie is an associate editor at Reuters Breakingviews.

'Human Error' at Website Led to Early Look at JPMorgan Earnings,"An employee's error at a website run by the Nasdaq stock market was to blame for the early preview that Wall Street and investors got of JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter earnings on Tuesday morning.  A Nasdaq spokesman blamed ""human error"" for the early posting of portion of JPMorgan's earnings release on the Shareholder.com website. The earnings release went up on the Nasdaq-run website at 3:36 a.m. Eastern time, about three and half hours before the nation's largest bank was scheduled to officially release its earnings. ""The root cause was a human error internally at Shareholder.com,"" said Ryan Wells, a Nasdaq spokesman. ""The issue was contained only to JPMorgan Chase and did not impact any other Shareholder.com clients."" The mistaken posting occurred when a Shareholder.com employee pushed the wrong button, said a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to talk. The earnings release was eventually removed from the Shareholder.com website but not before it was noticed by reporters working for several news organizations. On Wall Street, errors in typing in information, known as fat finger mistakes, are most often associated with brokerage employees typing in the wrong ticker for a stock or authorizing the wrong number of shares to be traded. The inadvertent posting of the bank's earnings release had initially prompted speculation of another potential data hack involving a Wall Street firm. Earlier this month, JPMorgan disclosed that a summer intrusion of its computer system compromised the names, addresses and emails of 76 million households and seven million small businesses. The bank has said that the hackers did not get access to any Social Security numbers and that there's no evidence the breach has resulted in any monetary loss to customers.  But the summer cyber assault on JPMorgan has raised concerns on Wall Street and Main Street about the security of customer information maintained at banks, brokers and asset management firms. Federal authorities have identified at least a dozen other financials firms that were either probed or infiltrated by the unknown hackers who are believed to operating overseas, possibly in Russia.  Nasdaq in the past has had its own issues with hackers. In 2011, hackers broke into the systems of the Nasdaq, but did not penetrate the part of the stock market that handles trades. "
Former Hedge Fund Analyst Charged With Stealing Data,"A former hedge fund analyst has been charged with stealing confidential computer data from his previous employer, the latest crackdown by the Manhattan district attorney on suspected violations of cybersecurity. The five felony charges against Kang Gao, who worked at the hedge fund Two Sigma Investments, include computer trespass and unlawful duplication of computer related material. A grand jury indicted Mr. Gao, a spokesman for the district attorney's office said. Specific charges in the indictment are scheduled to be disclosed next month. Mr. Gao was arrested on Feb. 11, and Two Sigma filed a civil lawsuit three days later, according to court documents. The hedge fund, which specializes in a computer-driven investment strategy called quantitative trading, contends that Mr. Gao planned to give confidential information on its models to a competitor or use it to start his own firm in China. Mr. Gao is a Chinese national.   Quantitative trading relies on mathematical modeling software that firms often develop on their own. In its suit, Two Sigma calls its models the ""lifeblood of its business"" and seeks to ban Mr. Gao from sharing any of its intellectual property while litigation is pending.  Mr. Gao did not appear at a hearing in the lawsuit on Thursday, when a judge ordered an injunction that bars him from using or transferring any of Two Sigma's proprietary information.  ""The distribution of Two Sigma's intellectual property to current or potential competitors would cause it irreparable harm and grave hardships to the company (and its clients),"" according to the company's original complaint. Two Sigma wants the court to order Mr. Gao to hand over his phone and other hardware, among other demands. Two Sigma also wants Mr. Gao to forfeit $384,000, his ""compensation during his period of disloyalty,"" which the firm contends began May 13. The judge ordered that $385,000 remain in Mr. Gao's bank account.  Two Sigma, which was founded in 2001, has $18.5 billion under management, according to Kelly Howard, Two Sigma's senior vice president for marketing and communications. The company's modeling teams ""work with vast data sets - from corporate earnings to news and weather reports,"" according to its website.  Mr. Gao, a 28-year-old graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, began working at Two Sigma in 2010 as a quantitative analyst. He resigned days before his arrest, according to the company's lawsuit. A lawyer for Mr. Gao in the criminal case, Benjamin Yu, said his client had pleaded not guilty to all five charges. It is unclear whether Mr. Gao has a lawyer representing him in the civil case. Cybercrime has been a top priority for Cyrus R. Vance, the Manhattan district attorney. Mr. Vance has publicly advocated for strengthening the laws against identity and computer code theft, and his office has bolstered its cyberforensic activity and facilities in recent years. The district attorney's office pursuing charges against Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer accused of stealing confidential source code from the bank's computers. Mr. Vance decided to pursue Mr. Aleynikov after a federal appeals court overturned his federal conviction in essentially the same case in 2010. But while Mr. Vance may want to crack down on white-collar cybercrime, legal experts point to a number of hurdles. For one, few precedents exist in state courts, and similar cases have met with mixed results in federal courts, where the definition of computer trespass and unauthorized access is less well defined. ""This is an increasingly common situation and the law here is pretty murky,"" said Orin S. Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University. ""The question is, if you violate an employee agreement about use of a computer, is that like hacking into the computer?"" In its complaint, Two Sigma said that Mr. Gao breached his employment agreement by looking at confidential models he did not have a right to view. Mr. Gao admitted to Mr. Vance's office that he emailed himself models he was not permitted to view, according to the criminal charges. ""Two Sigma takes the protection of our intellectual property very seriously,"" Mr. Howard said, adding that the firm alerted Mr. Vance's office once they began to suspect criminal activity. Two Sigma also contends that before his arrest, Mr. Gao researched cases of people who stole intellectual property and trade secrets from their employers and tried to transfer $100,000 into what the firm believes was the account of his girlfriend, a research associate at Morgan Stanley.  In court documents, the firm pointed to the transfer as potential evidence that Mr. Gao was trying to start a new business using trade secrets. "
"To Instill Love of Bitcoin, Backers Work to Make It Safe","SAN FRANCISCO -- BITCOIN'S future may not rely on stabilizing its price swings or signing up more merchants to accept the virtual currency. Rather, it may rely on its image. In the last few months, the value of Bitcoin has been cut in half, in the face of questions about security issues and concerns about new regulations. Warren E. Buffett referred to the currency as a ''mirage'' in an interview last month and told people to ''stay away.'' Would-be adopters and investors have grown fearful as hackers develop new ways to steal Bitcoin and major Bitcoin exchanges shut down. The Internal Revenue Service has even weighed in on how Bitcoin will be taxed. Proponents have a mounting public relations crisis on their hands, particularly as Bitcoin becomes hackers' preferred payment method. Hackers have recently taken to mounting large scale denial-of-service attacks on tech start-ups -- most recently, Meetup.org, a social meeting site; Vimeo, the video sharing service; and Basecamp, a project management software company -- and demanding payments via Bitcoin as ransom to cease.  Even the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit group that was set up to promote Bitcoin's legitimate use, was marred after one of its board members was arrested and charged with money laundering. In fact, the biggest Bitcoin holder is the United States government, after the F.B.I. seized some 144,000 coins -- roughly $66 million at current prices -- from Silk Road, the now-defunct digital market that prosecutors say aided drug deals and other illicit transactions. Consumer confidence in and adoption of new technologies -- especially regarding money -- is highly dependent on security, or at least the public's perception of security. To that end, Bitcoin enthusiasts, cryptographers and security researchers are putting renewed focus on security and self-policing. They face an uphill battle. While the Bitcoin system itself is protected by strong cryptography, thieves have pilfered hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of coins by exploiting weaknesses in private key storage systems and hundreds of millions more from exchanges. Joe Stewart and Pat Litke, two security researchers at Dell SecureWorks, set out in recent months to evaluate the threats facing Bitcoin. They discovered more than 120 unique families of malware on the Internet that had been specifically engineered to steal Bitcoin wallet files from people's computers, or to steal coins through other means such as recording a user's keystrokes so an attacker could grab a user's private keys as they type them in. The most common strains of malware they discovered were so-called wallet stealers, software specifically designed to search for a user's Bitcoin wallet on a hard drive or in well-known file locations. The attackers would then upload the information to a remote server, extract the keys and steal coins. Security experts have long advised the use of long, secure passwords, but Mr. Litke and Mr. Stewart found that in some cases, the attackers managed to bypass strong passcodes by using a keylogger, which records passwords when victims type them in, or by monitoring the copy-and-paste clipboard function. When the researchers tested the cryptocurrency malware against popular antivirus systems, they found the average detection rate was an abysmal 48.9 percent. More than half of major antivirus solutions failed to detect attackers' malicious code. And, unlike cases of credit card fraud, in which credit card companies can reimburse the victims, Bitcoin theft is similar to theft of cash. Once it's gone, it's probably gone for good. ''It's incredibly easy for malware to steal Bitcoin, especially if you're keeping them on the same computer you use to casually browse the Internet,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''There are so many holes for criminals to walk through.'' Mr. Stewart and other security researchers now advise users to keep their Bitcoin in so-called cold storage. The private keys needed to conduct a transaction are stored on a secure offline device, or even printed out, much like storing the bulk of one's cash in a physical safe. Some of the biggest Bitcoin thefts have occurred at the exchanges. Mt. Gox's operators say hackers were able to steal more than $450 million worth of Bitcoin using a bug that tricked its system into moving a user's coins to an attacker's account, while simultaneously fooling Mt. Gox's system into thinking the withdrawal did not go through. Mt. Gox would then resend the requested amount, effectively doubling the withdrawal from a user's account. Mt. Gox asserted that hackers used this bug to make off with 850,000 coins -- 750,000 owned by customers and 100,000 owned by Mt. Gox at the time of the announcement. One month later, Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's 28-year-old chief executive, said the company had found 200,000 coins in an old wallet. But last week, two Swiss researchers compared Mt. Gox's assertions with what they had witnessed across Bitcoin's distributed network. By creating specialized nodes that could trace and dump all transactions across the Bitcoin network, they found that only 386 coins could have been successfully stolen from the Bitcoin network using the bug Mt. Gox cited. Their conclusion: Some 650,000 coins were unaccounted for. Representatives for Mt. Gox did not return requests for comment. But after Mt. Gox was shut down in late February, other prominent exchanges were suddenly attacked. Flexcoin said it was hacked on March 2, forcing it to shut down. On March 5, Crypto-Trade also said it was attacked, but recently said it had resumed allowing Bitcoin withdrawals. To avoid similar fates, Bitcoin proponents, researchers and exchanges have started new systems and self-regulations to help instill confidence among adopters and bring Bitcoin into mainstream use. Two programmers from the Czech Republic, Marek Palatinus and Pavol Ruznak, created the Trezor Wallet after Mr. Palatinus lost more than 3,000 coins to cyberthieves. The wallet, a hardware device that cannot be infected by malware, makes cold storage more practical. A new Bitcoin vault service, Xapo, is promising to insure deposits from any losses to hacker attacks, theft by a Xapo employee, break-ins at its vault or any bankruptcy. Elsewhere, exchanges are working to improve ''transaction integrity verification,'' or the system by which transactions can be tied back to identities. An initiative called the Bison Network -- or the Bitcoin Identity Security Open Network -- is working with Jumio, a four-year-old credential management company backed by Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, to validate buyer's identities using Jumio's software. And after the I.R.S. announced last week that Bitcoin would be considered property and taxed as such, media reports pointed out that those living in the United States would have to begin the onerous task of tracking their Bitcoin purchases, or risk submitting fraudulent tax returns. Customers of Overstock, for example, may need accountants to figure out capital gains taxes on all the ups and downs of their Bitcoin holdings if they use the virtual currency every time they buy furniture on the site. The worry, many say, is that mounting security and a proliferation of rules could mean death by a thousand cuts. Max Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal, the digital payment system that itself was the target for hackers before it achieved acceptance, said in an interview this week that Bitcoin's fate would ultimately be dictated by whether users could find the right balance between security and convenience. ''What is slowing down adoption is that Bitcoin can be hard to understand and hard to use,'' Mr. Levchin said. ''It has to get really simple. For that simplicity to really happen, most often it necessarily has to become less secure to become more convenient.'' ''But at PayPal,'' Mr. Levchin added. ''I'd like to claim we found the intersection. So I know it's doable.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Bitcoin Foundation Seeks More Time to Address Virtual Currency Rules,"Big-name Bitcoin supporters are stepping up the pressure on New York's top financial regulator to extend the comment period for the state's new virtual currency rules. On Tuesday, the Bitcoin Foundation sent a letter to Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State's superintendent of financial services, asking for up to six months to provide feedback on the proposed regulations, and a minimum of 45 additional days.  ""With some important, sophisticated exceptions, the Bitcoin community is not well-versed in New York financial services law or regulation,"" the letter said. ""It takes time to gather the meanings of legal terms of art and to compare them with emerging technologies, processes and business models in the Bitcoin world.""  The move came a week after a group of virtual currency supporters sent a separate letter, which was signed by about 400 Bitcoin enthusiasts, requesting a similar extension of the comment period. The Bitcoin Foundation's letter asked Mr. Lawsky's office, the Department of Financial Services, to ""adopt an iterative process"" in which the department would issue multiple drafts of the legislation and take comments from interested parties. The letter calls for the department to ""resist the constraints of administrative procedures developed in the era of postage stamps,"" saying that the traditional comment process for legislative proposals is outdated. The foundation also requested a hearing to discuss the regulations. Of particular concern to the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Washington, is that Mr. Lawsky's draft legislation does not address the risks unique to digital currencies. ""The Bitcoin community is not used to being a heavily regulated industry,"" said Jim Harper, global policy counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation. Bitcoin supporters may feel unable to comment on the proposed regulations ""because the language doesn't tell you what the goal is,"" he added. To address the issue, the Bitcoin Foundation asked for a public document outlining Mr. Lawsky's rationale for the proposed rules. Should his office not provide such material, the foundation asked Mr. Lawsky to treat the letter as a request under New York's Freedom of Information Law. Mr. Lawsky's office responded on Tuesday evening that it was considering the letter as such a request and would provide documents to the foundation within 20 business days. When it was introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, Bitcoin found a following among anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology buffs who operated on the fringes of the financial system. Now, as virtual currency becomes more accepted in the mainstream, start-ups fear they may not have the resources to comply with regulations that seem to favor more established financial institutions. The regulations introduced by Mr. Lawsky's office are intended for virtual currency companies operating in New York and include rules on consumer protection, cybersecurity and the prevention of money laundering. A ""BitLicense"" would be required for Bitcoin exchanges and for companies that secure, store or maintain custody or control of the virtual currency on behalf of customers. Merchants that accept Bitcoin for payment would not have to apply for a license. Some Bitcoin supporters contend that New York's proposed rules will affect not only virtual currency companies operating in the state, but also businesses across the United States and the globe. Virtual currency start-ups have also expressed concern that they will not be able to meet certain licensing requirements, some of which are stricter than those for other financial institutions like banks. Smaller businesses are wary of the extensive reporting rules, significant capital requirements and robust cybersecurity programs to obtain a license, which would require extensive resources that many of the start-ups do not have. Other Bitcoin enthusiasts, however, view the proposed rules as an important step toward legitimizing the virtual currency. The public currently has 45 days from July 23 to comment on the proposal, after which Mr. Lawsky's office intends to make changes to the rules and send them back out for review for another 30 days. Mr. Lawsky said last week in an interview that he was willing to address concerns that it would be difficult for smaller companies to comply with the regulations. He also said he would consider extending the comment period.                       "
"Bitcoin's Price Sinks, but Causes Little Alarm Among Traders","Bitcoin is showing signs of weakness, if only temporarily. On Monday, the price of Bitcoin dropped 12 percent, to $435.60 from $492.95, according to the virtual currency website CoinDesk, its lowest value since May and far below its peak of about $1,150 last year.  Also, on Monday, BTC-e, an exchange with shadowy backing, the price briefly plunged to $309, although it may have been the result of a glitch and the price quickly recovered to where it was trading before.  The virtual currency had regained some of its value by Monday afternoon, trading around $460. Bitcoin's price has been trending downward in recent weeks, but the latest decline after a period of relative stability comes as new regulations and general stock market malaise have taken hold. New York's proposed regulation of virtual currency companies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's recent warning against digital money and the Bitcoin market's lack of liquidity may all have contributed to the recent drop, experts said. Europe is also expected to issue rules for Bitcoin. Those familiar with Bitcoin shrugged off the latest price movement, which they said was well within the typical range for the currency. ""This is just how Bitcoin trades, for better or worse,"" said Barry Silbert, who oversees a Bitcoin investment fund through his company, SecondMarket. ""This is normal - par for the course."" Bitcoin's wild price swings, however, can be jarring, particularly for those who are new to the virtual currency scene.  Since Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, its value has gone from just a few dollars to more than $1,000. In any given day, the currency's price can fluctuate by more than 5 percent. What makes the recent decline notable is the relative calm that preceded it. The price has hovered around $600 since June and has not fallen below $500 since May, according to CoinDesk. ""What was surprising in some ways was the period when Bitcoin was trading around $600 and not losing much price,"" said Steven Englander, a research analyst with Citigroup. ""The stability probably means that there isn't much going on."" Bitcoin is not the only alternative currency to experience a decline in recent days. So-called altcoins - including Litecoin, which has the second-highest market capitalization behind Bitcoin - have fallen in value across the board, according to the website CoinMarketCap. A number of recent developments could be influencing Bitcoin's price. In July, New York became the first state to propose regulations for virtual currency companies. The regulations, introduced by the Department of Financial Services, include rules on consumer protection, the prevention of money laundering and cybersecurity. A ""BitLicense"" would be required for Bitcoin exchanges and for companies that secure, store or maintain custody or control of the virtual currency on behalf of customers, which some supporters fear is much too broad. Last week, another regulatory agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, issued a warning on virtual currency, further igniting fear in the Bitcoin world over possible restrictions. ""Overall, the sense is that regulation is going to impede the growth of Bitcoin, which is contributing the negative sentiment,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""What's been weighing on Bitcoin more are shorter-term concerns about whether Bitcoin can develop.""  (Mr. Silbert, the investor, said these regulatory developments amounted to little more than ""noise,"" and were likely not playing a big role in Bitcoin's price movement.) Analysts and seasoned Bitcoin supporters may not be concerned about the recent dive, but the volatility of late is probably not helping push the currency into the mainstream, experts said. Unlike investors, who often bet on such price swings, more casual users are less likely to adopt a currency whose value is so unpredictable.   ""The range of fluctuations in Bitcoin has a dampening effect on consumer enthusiasm,"" Mr. Luria said.  This could spell trouble for the growing list of merchants, including Overstock and Dell, who have started accepting Bitcoin as a payment option. Retailers themselves are immune to Bitcoin's volatility because they accept Bitcoin through a third-party payment processor, which immediately converts the currency to dollars. For consumers to transact in Bitcoin, however, they must hold some of the currency, making them susceptible to any change in price.  Since Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, it has become increasingly more popular, particularly among investment firms and entrepreneurs. But in part because of its unpredictable price, consumers have remained reluctant to embrace the currency.  And experts, for the most part, do not expect this volatility to go away anytime soon. For one, there is a wide range of possible outcomes for the currency, so any small change in perception can drive a big price swing. In 10 years, for example, one Bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars if it becomes the global capital of trade. But it could also be worth next to nothing if its development is staunched by strict oversight.  ""It's very hard to come up with a fundamental value for Bitcoin,"" said Mr. Englander, the Citigroup analyst. ""What really defines the price is its reputation and expectations for the future.""                       "
More Comments Invited for Proposed Bitcoin Rules,"New York's Department of Financial Services said on Thursday that it would extend by 45 days the comment period for its proposed virtual currency regulations. Those interested in  on the new rules will now have until Oct. 21.  The move comes after a number of prominent Bitcoin supporters requested additional time to comment on the draft rules, which is intended for virtual currency companies operating in New York and includes rules on consumer protection, the prevention of money laundering and cybersecurity. A ""BitLicense"" would be required for Bitcoin exchanges and for companies that secure, store or maintain custody or control of virtual currency on behalf of their customers.   ""It's obvious that this is a novel regulation,"" Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of financial services, said in an interview on Thursday. ""It's really the collision of banking regulations with new technology, and we want to make sure we get it right."" Should Mr. Lawsky's office make significant changes to the proposal after the comment period, they will go out for further review. Since the proposed regulations were introduced in July, Bitcoin supporters have had a mixed reaction on whether they will help legitimize digital money or stanch innovation and threaten the freedom Bitcoin was intended to foster.  Many in the Bitcoin industry expressed concern that the original 45 days allotted for comments would not allow for enough time to fully digest the proposals. Start-ups in particular said they simply did not have enough resources to comply with regulations that seem to favor more established financial institutions. Mr. Lawsky said his office had received thousands of comments on the issue. Soon after the draft rules were made public, a group of about 400 virtual currency supporters sent a letter to Mr. Lawsky asking for a 45-day extension to the comment period. The Bitcoin Foundation sent a similar letter in the first week of August requesting up to six more months to provide feedback.  Supporters have also asked that the comment process be more iterative and that Mr. Lawsky hold a public hearing to discuss the proposals. On Wednesday, the three biggest Bitcoin exchanges in China, BTC China, OKCoin, and Huobi, sent comments to Mr. Lawsky addressing the proposed rules. Among other issues, the exchanges said that the BitLicense framework should only cover virtual currency companies with ""meaningful"" connections to New York.  ""As written, the proposed regulation is overly broad in its application outside the United States, imposes a disproportionate compliance burden on virtual currency businesses and misapplies normal compliance procedures,"" they said in a release. "
New York Regulator Outlines Changes to Bitcoin Rules,"New York's proposed Bitcoin regulations are coming into sharper focus. Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State's top financial regulator, on Thursday outlined revisions to the state's highly anticipated ""BitLicense"" proposal, providing the most detail yet on rules that, when finalized, could reshape the virtual currency industry.   While far from sweeping, the revised rules will address or eliminate many of the aspects that opponents had criticized for being vague or strict, including the types of companies that would be subject to the rules, Mr. Lawsky said in keynote remarks at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. Mr. Lawsky said his office, the Department of Financial Services, would publish the revised rules ""in the coming days"" after which the public will have 30 days to submit comments. He said he hoped to finalize regulations by early next year. The original BitLicense plan - the first attempt by a state to regulate virtual currency companies - included rules on consumer protection, capital requirements, the prevention of money laundering and cybersecurity. The proposal stipulated that the rules would pertain to Bitcoin exchanges and companies that secure, store or maintain custody or control of the virtual currency on behalf of customers.  Bitcoin enthusiasts have wavered on whether the regulations, first introduced in July, would help legitimize the virtual currency or whether they would curb innovation. Some cite the impending regulations as a chief reason the virtual currency appears to have lost momentum.  Many in the Bitcoin industry, for instance, have complained that the language in the proposal left the door open for the government to regulate companies that were only tangentially involved with digital currency.  In response, Mr. Lawsky said the new rules clarified that software developers and Bitcoin miners would not need to apply for operating licenses. Customer loyalty programs, rewards, and gift cards denominated in fiat currency would also not be subject to the BitLicense requirements. Start-ups had also expressed concern about the cost of compliance, which they said could discourage young companies. To address these complaints, Mr. Lawsky said, the revised regulations will offer a two-year transitional BitLicense for companies that ""are unable to satisfy all of the requirements of a full license."" Such transitional licenses are meant for start-ups and small businesses, he said. ""That transitional BitLicense will help provide start-ups an on-ramp as they build up their operations,"" Mr. Lawsky added.  Moreover, Mr. Lawsky said that companies would no longer be required to obtain the addresses and transaction data for all parties to a transaction. Opponents to the original proposal had complained that this rule would be particularly onerous while also running counter to the whole idea of anonymity that attracts many supporters to Bitcoin. Instead, Mr. Lawsky said that virtual currency companies would only need to obtain such information for their own customers or account holders and, when possible, for counterparties to the transaction.  From the beginning, Mr. Lawsky has emphasized that the virtual currency rules were intended to inspire consumer confidence and promote commerce. He acknowledged, however, that Bitcoin was nowhere near the powerful financial force its supporters hope it will one day become. ""Virtual currencies such as Bitcoin are a very, very long way from being a credible challenger to banks or the existing payments system,"" Mr. Lawsky said. ""But I think virtual currency could eventually cause some amount of self-reflection in the legacy financial system."" "
Putin Supports Project to 'Secure' Russia Internet,"MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin appeared on Wednesday to throw his support behind a plan to isolate the Internet in Russia from the rest of the World Wide Web, but said the Russian government was ''not even considering'' censoring Internet sites.  In a speech to the Russian National Security Council, Mr. Putin said the plan was intended to build a backup system to keep websites in the Russian domains -- those ending in .ru and .rf -- online in a national emergency. Mr. Putin said other countries had taken to using the Internet ''for not only economic, but military and political goals'' and said information security was a priority for the country. The Russian news media has labeled the plan, some details of which were reported last month by Vedomosti, a Russian daily, a ''kill switch'' for the Internet, or Russia's answer to the ''Great Firewall'' put up by the Chinese. ''It's important to secure the Russian segment of the Internet,'' Mr. Putin said, according to a transcript posted on the Kremlin website. ''We do not intend to limit access to the Internet, to put it under total control, to nationalize the Internet. ''We need to greatly improve the security of domestic communications networks and information resources, primarily those used by state structures,'' he added. The Russian goals appear for now distinct from those of the Chinese, experts on Internet policy say, and inspired partly by a revelation this summer in Wired magazine by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, who lives in Moscow, that United States government hackers inadvertently crashed the Syrian web in 2012. Russia has recently promulgated policies to censor the Internet through laws banning extremist content and requiring social networking and financial companies to base their data servers in Russia. The goal of the new system, however, appears not to block foreign content, but rather to keep Russia's own news and information machine online in times of crisis. Oleg Demidov, an authority on Russian Internet policies at the PIR center in Moscow, said that Russia wanted to create a ''double channel'' for the Internet. The backup channel would of course be under government control. ''In normal times, it would work like it does now,'' he said of this Russian vision of the Internet. ''But in an emergency, the reserve system would come alive.'' "
Samsung Turns to Blackberry for Security Software,"The rapid rise of Android-based smartphones was a prominent factor in BlackBerry's profound decline. Now BlackBerry is counting on some Android phones to ensure its future.  BlackBerry announced on Thursday that Samsung would use server and phone management software as well as BlackBerry's unique global network to improve security for Android phones and tablets aimed at government users. There is such historic animosity between BlackBerry and Samsung that while making the announcement at an event in San Francisco, John Sims, the president of BlackBerry's corporate and government services unit, joked about the improbability of executives from both companies sharing a stage, a sentiment echoed by Greg Wade, a vice president of Samsung. BlackBerry has boasted that its network and software, as well as special hardware within its phones, provide a level of security for corporate and government users that its competitors cannot match. Opening up some of those components to Samsung, which last year challenged BlackBerry with a security service known as Knox, may now erode some of BlackBerry's handset sales advantage. But Jan Dawson, the principal of Jackdaw Research, said the move by BlackBerry was unavoidable and would be positive for the company. ''This isn't a concession of defeat as much as it's a concession to reality -- most people aren't going to choose BlackBerry devices and so BlackBerry needs to find a way to make its management solutions relevant beyond its own devices,'' Mr. Dawson wrote in an email from the BlackBerry presentation. ''BlackBerry's handset business is a tiny fraction of what it once was, and that's not going to change whatever happens.'' John S. Chen, who became BlackBerry's chief executive about a year ago, has said that he planned to shift the company's focus to software and service. At Thursday's session, he repeated a promised to double BlackBerry's annual software revenue of $250 million by next year. Samsung will use a new form of BlackBerry's software, BlackBerry Enterprise Server 12, which was also introduced on Thursday. Mr. Chen acknowledged that the previous version of the company's management software ''disrupted the flow of our business'' with corporate and government customers. The new version adds additional security features and will allow users to control and management wireless communications with devices well beyond phones like medical equipment. It will work with iPhones, Android phones, like the previous software, and add older BlackBerrys and Microsoft Windows Phone 8. Subscription fees for the software, ranging from $19 to $60 a year for each user, will be crucial to Mr. Chen's ambitious sales goal. Mr. Dawson said that the deal with BlackBerry will not provide Samsung's Knox with all of the Canadian company's security features, adding: ''I'm sure BlackBerry would still argue that its own devices are the most secure.'' Looking back on his first year at BlackBerry, Mr. Chen recalled that he once ''unwisely'' told a reporter that his wife used a Samsung Android phone. ''Now I feel somewhat redeemed,'' he said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"For Target, the Breach Numbers Grow","Target on Friday revised the number of customers whose personal information was stolen in a widespread data breach during the holiday season, now reporting a range of 70 million to 110 million people. The stunning figure represents about a third of all American adults at the low end, and is nearly three times as great as the company's original estimate at the upper end. The theft is one of the largest ever of retail data. Not only did Target's announcement disclose a vastly expanded universe of victims, but it revealed that the hackers had stolen a broader trove of data than originally reported. The company now says that other kinds of information were taken, including mailing and email addresses, phone numbers or names, the kind of data routinely collected from customers during interactions like shopping online or volunteering a phone number when using a call center. On Dec. 19, Target confirmed reports that payment data was stolen from about 40 million customers who shopped in its stores in the United States from Nov. 27 to mid-December. As its investigation into the theft continued, the company said it had found that an additional quantity of data, collected over time on 70 million people and stored separately from the in-store data, was stolen.  The latest subset of potential victims includes customers who may not have shopped at Target during the holiday period. Although there is probably some overlap between the two groups, the company said it did not know the extent. When Target's security breach became public in mid-December, customers flooded help lines, the company's website and its Facebook page expressing worry and irritation. And it now appears that wary customers steered clear of Target stores during the last days of the shopping season, as suggested by the company's statement on Friday that sales declined noticeably after the disclosure. The effect of the data theft has reached far beyond one of the nation's largest retailers. Major credit card companies and banks have been issuing warnings about potential fraud to their customers and providing them with new cards and account numbers as a precaution. Some banks have limited cash withdrawals. As banks and companies continue to monitor customers' accounts for suspicious activity, the Secret Service and the Justice Department have opened an investigation. ''This will impact many Target business partners -- Visa, MasterCard and the host of banks and credit agencies that now have to keep an eye on the 110 million customers now vulnerable to identity theft,'' said Hemu Nigam, founder of SSP Blue, a security and privacy consulting firm. ''It affects more than Target customers. It affects mortgage lenders and car sales. It affects the entire economic infrastructure.'' Fraud experts said the information stolen from Target's systems quickly flooded the black market. On Dec. 11, shortly after hackers first breached Target, Easy Solutions, a company that tracks fraud, noticed a 10 to twentyfold increase in the number of high-value stolen cards on black market websites, from nearly every bank and credit union. The company apologized again on Friday for the broadening violation of its customers' privacy. ''I know that it is frustrating for our guests to learn that this information was taken, and we are truly sorry they are having to endure this,'' Gregg W. Steinhafel, Target's chief executive, said in a statement. Security experts say that clever hackers could potentially piece together customers' stolen information for identity theft or for use in a so-called spear phishing attack, in which hackers send a highly tailored emails to victims asking them to click on a link or download an attachment that, once opened, gives hackers a foothold into their computers and employers' networks. Target has been working with a forensics team at Verizon, and it has also consulted with Mandiant, a security firm specializing in data breach recovery, which recently agreed to be acquired by FireEye, the security software company, for close to $1.1 billion. After the initial breach, Target said that it had protected customers' payment information with encryption and that it had stored the keys to descramble it on separate systems not affected in the breach. But the encryption algorithm Target used to protect that data -- a standard known as triple DES, or 3DES -- is vulnerable in some cases to so-called brute force attacks, when hackers use computers for high-speed guessing. In a breach on Adobe last year, hackers were able to bypass 3DES encryption through brute force attacks and exposed tens of millions of Adobe passwords within weeks of the breach. On Friday, a Target spokeswoman would not comment on whether the second batch of information stolen from its 70 million customers was encrypted. In Adobe's case, too, the number of stolen records was significantly larger than the company initially reported. When Adobe first reported the breach in October, it said hackers had gained access to payment card and personal data for 2.9 million customers, including user names and passwords. By the end of the month, the tally had grown to more than 38 million records. Until now, the most extensive data breach on record for a retailer was the theft of 90 million records from T. J. Maxx in 2005. The biggest breach over all, however, was in 2009, when the card processor Heartland Payment Systems was targeted and 130 million credit card numbers were stolen. Security experts say the number of Target customers exposed could still grow. ''Like a natural catastrophe, usually a low number of breached records is reported and, as the story unfolds, the number of compromises grows and grows,'' said Anup Ghosh, founder of Invincea, a security software company. ''In Target's case, what this highlights is that the point-of-sale systems customers use to swipe their credit cards are connected to the corporate network like everything else. There is lots of opportunity to compromise individuals through point-of-sale machines and then pivot to the corporate network.'' Mr. Ghosh said he suspected that hackers might use the trove of email addresses to send spoofed correspondence from Target, asking users for more information than they would typically be asked to enter, such as a mother's maiden name or a Social Security number, that hackers could use for identity theft, or to take their credentials and use it for cybercrime. Jay Mayfield, a spokesman for the Federal Trade Commission, the federal agency charged with investigating data breaches, said he could not comment on the Target breach or confirm whether the agency was investigating. Historically, the agency has filed nearly 50 lawsuits against companies in cases where it found that the company's data security was not up to acceptable standards. The holiday season is a critical time for most retailers, and it can account for 20 to 40 percent of a retailer's annual sales, according to industry groups. Long before the data breach, Target's executives predicted a flat sales season. Once Target disclosed the theft to consumers, sales dropped. The company tried to entice wary customers to shop by offering a 10 percent discount on purchases in its stores the weekend before Christmas, but the damage to customer loyalty surfaced in the latest sales figures. Target said the decline in sales after the breach was disclosed might be 2 to 6 percent among stores that had been open at least a year, in contrast to the previous season. The company said it had started to see some improvement in its performance in recent days. In yet more grim news from Target, the retailer announced on Friday that it would close eight United States stores in May, in locations including Las Vegas, Memphis and Middletown, Ohio. As Target continued to investigate its breach, another major retailer, Neiman Marcus, confirmed on Friday that it, too, had been breached. The retailer, based in Texas, said it began investigating reports of fraudulent activity on credit cards belonging to customers who had recently shopped in its stores and discovered it was the result of an intrusion on its systems. The company said some customers' credit card details may have been stolen, but did not say how many records were potentially compromised. "
Target tech chief resigns as it overhauls security,"NEW YORK -- (AP) -- Target Corp. (NYSE:TGT) Chief Information Officer Beth Jacob is resigning effective Wednesday as the retailer overhauls its information security and compliance division in the wake of a massive pre-Christmas data breach. Target Chairman, President and CEO Gregg Steinhafel said in a statement released to The Associated Press that the company will search for an interim chief information officer who can help guide the company through the transformation.  Jacob had been in her current role since 2008 and oversaw teams in the U.S. and India. Target disclosed on Dec. 19 that the data breach compromised 40 million credit and debit card accounts between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15. Then on Jan. 10 it said hackers also stole personal information -- including names, phone numbers as well as email and mailing addresses -- from as many as 70 million customers. Target, based in Minneapolis, also plans to look outside the company for a chief information security officer and a chief compliance officer. Before the overhaul, information security functions were split among a variety of executives. Target's new chief information security officer will centralize those responsibilities, the company said. The previous duties of chief compliance officer were overseen by Target's current vice president of assurance risk and compliance, who had previous plans to retire at the end of March. Now, Target is separating the responsibility for assurance risk and compliance. Target also says it's working with an outside adviser, Promontory Financial Group, to help it evaluate its technology, structure, processes and talent as part of the overhaul. ""While we are still in the process of an ongoing investigation, we recognize that the information security environment is evolving rapidly,"" Steinhafel said in a statement. Target is still grappling with the fallout of the theft. The company said last week that its profit for the fourth quarter fell 46 percent on a revenue decline of 5.3 percent as the breach scared off customers. While Target said sales have been recovering since it disclosed the breach in mid-December, the company expects business to be muted for some time. It issued a profit outlook for the current quarter and full year that was below Wall Street estimates. The company is offering free credit monitoring for a year for any customer shopping at a Target store who wants it. It's also equipping its locations with more security technology. Target is accelerating its $100 million plan to roll out chip-based credit card technology, which experts say is more secure than using traditional magnetic stripe cards. When the final tally is in, Target's breach may eclipse the biggest known data breach at a retailer, one disclosed in 2007 at the parent company (OOTC:KIDSQ) of TJ Maxx that affected 90 million records. In a posting last week on a company blog, Steinhafel said, ""In the weeks ahead, we hope to understand more about how this attack happened. And will use what we learn to inform our guests, make Target a safer place to shop and to drive change across the broader retail industry."" In a letter to Steinhafel furnished by Target, the outgoing Chief Information Officer Jacob said resigning was a ""difficult decision,"" but she said that ""this was a time of significant transformation for the retail industry and for Target."" She did not mention the data breach. ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio NYT ID: 64242455 "
Consumers Not Powerless in the Face of Credit Card Fraud,"When you think about the security of your credit and debit cards, consider the facts on the ground. Industry representatives readily admit that thieves are often one step ahead of them and that data breaches are a fact of life. One bank went rogue and publicly called out MasterCard and Bank of America for not sharing information and for failing to stem card fraud fast enough in Chicago taxicabs. Now a for-profit college, sensing opportunity, has found its own angle. Monroe College is currently pitching a minor in cybersecurity. Its ad on New York City subways features a woman in a white coat holding a card that intersects with beams of light. Perhaps she'll invent a way to solve the payments industry's problems. Until then, you have to help yourself. Most card companies already have custom alerts and other features that not enough consumers use. Then there's something that all cards should have but most don't -- an on/off switch accessible from a mobile app that could keep most fraud from happening. Finally, there are the microchip cards that most of the rest of the civilized world uses but that barely exist in the United States so far.  Let's take them in order. Alerts and Other Tools Whether you're using a debit or credit card, there are all sorts of ways to limit the damage a thief might do, or at least get a quick warning that one is on the loose. Capital One offers a typical list: Customers can turn on text or email alerts that will arrive when their balance goes above or below an amount that the customer sets, when a charge occurs above or below a certain amount, when any charge occurs at all, or if a transaction doesn't go through because there isn't enough money in the checking account. Citibank can ping you if you're within a set distance from your credit limit. Chase will text you if its systems detect an unusual charge and let you reject it on the spot. When I logged into American Express's website recently, I found that I could get an alert whenever someone gets a cash advance using the card (something I never do). There is no reason not to set at least a few alerts, even if they may only warn you about theft after it has occurred. Some banks, like Bank of America and Citibank, will generate a one-time-use card number for online shopping. That way, you can cross sketchy websites (or sketchy employees at legitimate sites) off your list of things to worry about. Other institutions, like Capital One, don't offer this service because so few people end up using it. Committed debit card users may want to consider the two-account approach that a reader mentioned in the online comments about last week's column. The strategy here is to use one checking account for everyday spending with a debit card and a separate checking account for recurring payments. Destroy the debit card for the second account, and you won't have to worry about a thief stealing the card, draining the account and causing your mortgage or other payments to come up short. The On/Off Switch If everyone turned their debit or credit cards on before each charge and then off again before returning the plastic to the wallet, it would be a lot harder for thieves to do their work. This technology actually exists. A company called Malauzai Software built an on/off switch after one of its bank customers sought a solution to the amount of time its representatives were spending on the phone with people whose debit cards had gone missing. It wanted the customers to be able to turn the cards off temporarily via their mobile banking app until they found them again or declared them lost and asked for a replacement. Malauzai obliged, but it soon discovered that fraud-wary customers were turning the cards on and off before and after every charge. ''The fraud prevention thing was gravy on top of the mashed potatoes,'' said Robb Gaynor, Malauzai's co-founder and chief product officer. ''It was unexpected.'' Now 70 to 80 institutions, all smaller banks or credit unions, have adopted Malauzai's on/off switch. Capital One has built its own for debit cards, as have USAA and Simple, which was acquired by BBVA last month. Of customers who are active on mobile banking apps and patronize a bank that uses Malauzai's switch, 3 to 5 percent of them flip it at least once each month. Recurring charges for things like mobile phone bills get a code that allows them to go through even when a customer has turned the card off. A company called TSYS has its own new on/off offering for banks that can geo-fence transactions, keeping any from going through unless they're relatively close to a user's mobile phone. Ellen Richey, Visa's chief legal officer, expressed a bit of skepticism about the on/off switch. The right malware could muck it up, and users may forget that their cards are off and get annoyed at the cash register when things aren't working. ''One thing we have found is that consumers are remarkably impatient with anything that gets between them and making a payment,'' she said. Perhaps, but why not let consumers decide whether they mind that friction? So far, Chase, American Express, Citibank and Bank of America have no plans to do so. If enough of you demand it, however, perhaps they'll see the light. This is what happened with the now ubiquitous tool that lets you deposit checks by taking a picture of them with your phone and zapping them to the bank. Chip Cards The United States is such a fraud-friendly country in part because we still use old-fashioned magnetic stripes on the back of our cards. This makes it relatively easy for thieves to make counterfeit ones. At long last, retailers and banks and the companies that process their payments are preparing to begin to possibly get their acts together on this front. Over the next 18 months, more debit and credit card issuers will issue plastic with a microchip inside that will transmit a unique code each time you use it in person. Presumably, thieves won't be able to counterfeit that sort of thing easily, at least for a while. Then, on Oct. 1, 2015, assuming there aren't any extensions, most retailers that don't have terminals to read the chip cards yet will be responsible for certain types of fraud if it occurs. If retailers do have the terminals but a bank hasn't gotten around to giving a consumer a chip-enabled card, the bank will pay for the fraud as a penalty for lagging the retailers. It's an elaborate game of chicken, fitting for an industry where the major players spent years embroiled in a lawsuit. Most people will be dipping these new cards in the terminals instead of swiping them, and some banks may eventually make you enter a PIN instead of signing for a purchase. As long as you don't lose your card or have the actual plastic stolen, the sort of fraud that went on with Target should be a lot harder to pull off. That said, the thieves will then immediately migrate online, since many people will still be typing numbers into websites the old-fashioned way for the foreseeable future. There, the bad guys will find a more welcoming environment, at least until everyone involved with card payments agrees on a technology to thwart the scofflaws there, too. A process called tokenization may become the security standard, or perhaps you'll be inputting codes you receive via text message, similar to the way you might be now if you have activated two-step verification for Gmail. Ms. Richey of Visa says she believes that the various industry players will be quick to act online as well. After all, if they do nothing, the rate of online fraud may rise at the same rate that in-person card fraud falls thanks to all those microchips. ''It's so compelling that it will fuel the merchant and bank players' willingness to proceed,'' she said. ''Otherwise, they won't get the benefit of the investments they've made in chip cards.'' That's a lot of ifs, in an industry that has waited an awfully long time to fix its fraud problems while inconveniencing millions of customers. Let's hope it happens as they say it will. Until it does, set some alerts and pester your bank to give you all of the technological options that ought to be available right now. "
"After Data Breach, Target Plans to Issue More Secure Chip-and-PIN Cards","Still pushing to right itself after an enormous data breach by cybercriminals, Target announced on Tuesday that it would switch its debit and credit cards over to a more secure technology by early next year, most likely making it the first major retailer in the country to do so. The company also said on Tuesday that it had hired a new chief information officer to oversee the company's technology team and data security.  The new debit and credit card technology, called chip and PIN, is widely used in Europe and considered to be far more secure than most cards used in the United States, which rely on magnetic strips. While it does not address all fraud, the chip makes a card hard to duplicate, and the pin, or personal identification number, more difficult for a thief to use. ''The move toward chip and PIN had been a very slow process in the United States because so many players have to restructure everything,'' said Suzanne Martindale, a staff lawyer at Consumers Union. ''We're hoping that Target moving in this direction will encourage other retailers and financial institutions to create more secure payment cards, because it's long overdue.'' Target has said it would spend $100 million switching to the new system, which includes changing its branded credit and debit Redcards, as well as the cost of installing new payment terminals. Company executives have been promoting the chip and PIN system industrywide since the breach, and in the wake of several prominent data hacks, the transition to this technology appears to have gained traction in recent months. In February, for example, JPMorgan Chase said it would begin issuing some chip-and-PIN-enabled credit cards this year. Experts stress, however, that these cards would not have necessarily helped those whose data was stolen in the Target breach. But Target is eager to lead the charge all the same as part of its monthslong effort to restore consumer confidence. ''Target is snakebit,'' said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a trade publication about payment cards. ''In this post-breach era, they're going to do everything they can to let their customers know that they're trying to be as security conscious as possible.'' At the helm of Target's new cybersecurity apparatus will be Bob DeRodes, who has held senior technology positions at a variety of companies including Home Depot and Delta Air Lines, and has served as a consultant to several federal agencies, including the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments, Target said. The previous head of technology at the retailer, Beth M. Jacob, resigned in March after facing questions about whether she had the appropriate training to oversee protection of the company's computer networks that housed huge amounts of private consumer data. The company also outlined some of the security measures it had been adapting. In some instances, it has deployed advanced technology like white-listing, which allows only web traffic that the company knows is innocuous to enter its systems. In other cases, the company is adding more sophisticated security around its network, including for its payment systems and customer data, which security experts say the company should have done long ago. ''I believe Target has a tremendous opportunity to take the lessons learned from this incident and enhance our overall approach to data security and information technology,'' Gregg Steinhafel, Target's chief executive, said in a statement. On Dec. 19, 2013, just days before Christmas and in the crush of the holiday shopping season, Target publicly acknowledged that credit and debit card information for 40 million customers had been exposed. A few weeks later, the company said a second batch of information, the personal information of some 70 million people, had been compromised as well. The company has since said it believed there was overlap of at least 12 million people in the two groups. The company's earnings underscored how much the breach had hurt store traffic and sales. Its fourth-quarter profits were down 46 percent compared with the same period the year before. During that quarter, the company said, it spent $61 million on breach-related expenses, and executives said they expected the costs to continue. Several other retailers and a hotel company have also been hacked in recent months. Data breaches at Neiman Marcus and the arts and crafts retailer Michaels are believed to have been committed by the same band of criminals in Eastern Europe that infiltrated Target, according to people involved in the investigation, who were not authorized to speak publicly. "
Faltering Target Parts Ways With Chief,"The chief executive of Target, Gregg Steinhafel, resigned from the company on Monday, signaling the depths of the damage done by last year's extensive breach of customer information. While the online attack has been the most prominent of the retailer's problems, other issues -- including sluggish customer traffic, a competitive online market and a badly disappointing expansion into Canada -- have compounded the turmoil. After extensive discussions between the board and Mr. Steinhafel, and as the company's latest quarter drew to a close, Target's board said on Monday that it had determined the company needed new leadership.  Target is scheduled to release earnings for its first financial quarter later this month, its second profit report since the breach, and in notes to investors on Monday morning, retail analysts said Mr. Steinhafel's resignation did not bode well. ''Presumably the board was not pleased with Steinhafel's performance, and we think that it is fair to assume that current business trends are not particularly good,'' Faye Landes, an analyst at Cowen, wrote in a note to investors. ''The board also may have come to the conclusion that the problems leading to the credit breach were the results of underinvestment, which is a C.E.O. decision, and the aftereffect of the breach may ultimately be quite costly, which we believe to be the case.'' Ms. Landes said that many of the retailer's shortcomings -- including its performance in Canada and at its online retail site, which some analysts say they believe is trailing the competition -- also reflect a lack of investment. A Target spokeswoman, Dustee Jenkins, said the decision to replace Mr. Steinhafel had been made recently, though she declined to provide specific details. Just three weeks ago, the company invited retail analysts to a meeting in New York at the end of May to be held with company leadership, which then included Mr. Steinhafel. ''The last several months have tested Target in unprecedented ways,'' Mr. Steinhafel, 59, said in a letter to the board. ''We have already begun taking a number of steps to further enhance data security, putting the right people, processes and systems in place.'' Those steps are proving costly. Last week, the company announced a timetable for adopting chip-and-PIN technology for all its Target-branded debit and credit cards, a technology used widely in Europe that is considered more secure. Target officials estimated that the switch to a new technology, and to terminals that can process it, will cost $100 million. In addition, the company reported spending $61 million in its fourth fiscal quarter for breach-related expenses and said it expected to spend more. Target, one of the country's largest retailers, is known for promoting from the ranks, but said it would consider candidates both inside and outside the company, as well as from outside the retail industry. The retailer has hired the executive search firm Korn Ferry to help look for Mr. Steinhafel's successor. In the interim, it named John Mulligan, the chief financial officer, to be president and chief executive, while Roxanne S. Austin, a Target board member, will serve as nonexecutive chairwoman. Analysts suggested that Kathryn A. Tesija, executive vice president of merchandising at Target, might be a possible successor from within company ranks, and William S. Simon, chief executive of Walmart U.S., who was recently passed over to lead the entire organization, could be an outside candidate. But no obvious successor was readily apparent to Wall Street. And given the complexities of Target's challenges and its size -- the retailer had $72.6 billion in revenue last year -- analysts say filling the role may be a challenge. In recent months, a spate of online attacks against retailers, including Neiman Marcus and the craft store chain Michaels, have come to light. According to those with knowledge of federal inquiries into the data breaches, most of the attacks can be attributed to a loose gang of criminals in Eastern Europe. Beyond the breach, Target's troubles extend to Canada, where it opened more than 100 stores in a matter of months, delivering disappointing profit margins. The company, with about 1,800 stores in the United States, has struggled with inventory problems in Canada. ''You have to have good supply lines or you'll lose the battle and lose the war, and that's exactly what happened in Canada,'' said Burt P. Flickinger III of the Strategic Resource Group, a consulting firm. Target officials had acknowledged in the months since the breach that warning signs of computer hacking had been missed in the weeks before the attack was made public. The disclosure, made in December in the final days of the holiday shopping season, exposed the payment data of 40 million Target customers and the personal data of 70 million customers. Some 12 million people are thought to have both their payment and their personal data compromised. The company's stock has bumped along since December, dropping most sharply in January and February, as the breach and its financial impact proved to be significant. On Monday, it finished down more than 3 percent, at $59.87. Company executives have said the breach had an immediate, significant impact on the company's performance, pushing sales and traffic down substantially. The company's profit in the quarter that ended Feb. 1 plummeted 46 percent from the same period the year before. Since then, the company's information security apparatus has come under scrutiny from experts, and its officials have been summoned to testify before congressional panels about individuals' privacy on the Internet. Some experts have said the company's network was vulnerable to attack, and Target later conceded that its security system had issued alerts that were not heeded about suspicious activity. The company's chief information officer at the time, Beth M. Jacob, was the first high-level executive to resign after the breach, stepping down in March. The retailer said that she would be replaced by Bob DeRodes, who has held senior technology positions at companies including Home Depot and Delta Air Lines. Nonetheless, as Target announced Mr. Steinhafel's resignation, some online security experts were quick to say that dismissing him solely because of the data breach would be wrongheaded. ''If a C.E.O.'s longevity is based on their ability to keep an adversary off the network, everyone will lose their jobs,'' said Shawn Henry, president of CrowdStrike, a security firm in Irvine, Calif. Mr. Steinhafel had been with Target for 35 years. As chief executive, a position he held since 2008, he received annual compensation of about $20 million. "
"Retaliatory Attacks, Online","HONG KONG -- Two large American steel makers, United States Steel and Allegheny Technologies, each lost confidential files in online attacks. The largest solar panel manufacturer in the United States, SolarWorld, lost technological secrets, production cost data, cash flow projections and details of its legal strategy. The United Steelworkers union lost computer records containing trade policy strategies and discussions about rare earth metals and auto parts. All four had something in common besides the data thefts: Each was publicly pushing back against China's trade policies by seeking help from the World Trade Organization or the Commerce Department. A Justice Department indictment released on Monday -- which accuses five Chinese military personnel of the attacks -- reads like a chronology of most of the major trade disputes between the United States and China in the last five years.  In most instances, the American company or union that defied Beijing ended up facing extensive break-ins by Chinese military hackers, according to the documents. It is a pattern that could discourage further trade policy challenges. The Chinese government responded furiously on Tuesday, calling in the newly installed American ambassador, Max Baucus, to protest the release of the indictment, which was accompanied by F.B.I. ''wanted'' posters of Chinese soldiers in uniform. The Chinese foreign ministry and defense ministry vehemently denied any wrongdoing while accusing the United States of engaging in extensive intelligence gathering of its own. ''China demands that the U.S. give it a clear explanation of its cybertheft, bugging and monitoring activities, and immediately stop such activity,'' the defense ministry said in a news release. But behind the acrimony lay an uncomfortable risk for many American companies, as well as businesses from the European Union and elsewhere: Standing against Beijing, or even alerting foreign governments to trade issues, can carry serious repercussions. Western companies operating in China have long been aware that they might be susceptible to eavesdropping by the authorities. They have also faced legal cases alleging the sale of tainted food and other improprieties for which Chinese companies, particularly state-owned enterprises, are seldom investigated. What stands out about those who suffered losses in the cases in the Justice Department indictment is that they involve executives and employees living and working in the United States. As such, they may have been slower to think about the possibility of Chinese retaliation if they contended that Chinese exports were being subsidized by the Chinese government or dumped below cost in the United States. ''Is China setting new rules, so that if you take them to the World Trade Organization, or if you go to the Commerce Department, then you'll get punished?'' asked David Zweig, the director of the Center on China's Transnational Relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. If so, companies may back off from challenging China, he said. If China has begun retaliating against companies that seek the enforcement of free trade rules, as the indictment suggests, that could allow Beijing to begin creating an international trading system in which China has more latitude to pursue its own policies, Mr. Zweig added. China's surveillance of its own citizens is so pervasive that some Western executives doing business in China say that they accept it as almost routine and do not worry about it. ''People just assume everything they do is being watched -- I always assume every email I send is read, every conversation I have is listened to,'' said a Western executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The executive said that the United States was far from blameless. He noted that Edward J. Snowden had released information documenting that the National Security Agency gathers intelligence around the world as well. The United States government takes the position that it has been spying to gather military, political and economic intelligence. It argues that such activities are fundamentally different from and less of an intrusion on civil liberties than spying to gain a commercial advantage. The usually cautious American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, also called AmCham China, issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon, essentially endorsing this position. ''The issue of cybersecurity is a major and growing concern for the business community,'' the statement said. ''While we cannot comment on the specifics of any particular case, AmCham China believes there is a fundamental difference between intelligence gathering for legitimate national security purposes and intelligence gathering for stealing trade secrets, and that the definition of national security ought not include economic interests. We urge both governments to reach agreement on the rules of the road regarding cybersecurity incorporating this distinction.'' AmCham China is a coalition of American companies and individuals doing business in China and is independent of the United States and Chinese governments. The Justice Department indictment included an unusually detailed description of SolarWorld's troubles after it filed trade cases against China. As waves of ever lower-priced solar panels showed up in the United States from China, the Oregon subsidiary of SolarWorld, a German company, hired trade lawyers in 2011 to ask the Commerce Department to investigate whether Chinese companies, with subsidies from their government, were selling solar panels below cost, or dumping them. A Commerce Department investigation found evidence of dumping and subsidies, and the agency began imposing steep tariffs on Chinese imports in May 2012. But according to the Justice Department indictment, that legal victory began a new round of troubles for SolarWorld. A Chinese soldier and at least one co-conspirator are accused of orchestrating a series of break-ins into SolarWorld's computers from May to September 2012 and stealing a long list of crucial documents. The files allegedly taken included the chief financial officer's cash flow projections for how long SolarWorld could survive and detailed information on technological innovations and production lines, the costs for every production input and even SolarWorld's discussions of legal strategy with its lawyers. SolarWorld said in a news release that it was ''deeply troubled'' by the revelations in the indictment. ''It's yet another example of the Chinese government's systematic campaign to seek unfair advantage in the U.S. and global solar industry,'' the statement said. ''Already, dozens of U.S. companies have closed operations, and thousands of U.S. employees have lost their jobs.'' Only two of the companies identified by the Justice Department as victims of computer break-ins were not in the middle of trade disputes with China. One, Westinghouse, is building four civilian nuclear reactors in eastern China for state-owned Chinese enterprises, while trying to limit the sharing or expropriation of its proprietary technology. The indictment said that Westinghouse's confidential designs for pipes, pipe supports and pipe routings were stolen, along with its strategies for the Chinese market and its plans for preventing Chinese companies from reselling its technologies to others. The other company, the aluminum producer Alcoa, was in talks to acquire a mining operation. ''To our knowledge, no material information was compromised during this incident which occurred several years ago,'' said a company spokeswoman. ''Safeguarding our data is a top priority for Alcoa, and we continue to invest resources to protect our systems."" Some industries have already reached accommodations with Beijing that may insulate them from further pressure. American, European and Japanese automakers have all won large shares of the Chinese car market through joint ventures with local partners that have been fairly slow to develop their own design expertise and have been content mostly to build cars according to foreign designs. And with China now the world's second-largest movie market, some Hollywood studios have begun making presentations to Chinese censors early in the production process for movies. They have also entered into joint ventures with Chinese state-controlled enterprises and have even invited Chinese officials to participate in creative decisions at some filming locations to ensure that movies will not be barred from the country's theaters. By contrast, there is little risk of being barred from American theaters for movies that question the United States government. Sony Pictures Entertainment announced last Wednesday that it had acquired the film rights to a book about Mr. Snowden. But so far, there has been no sign of a Hollywood movie on ''Ugly Gorilla,'' the Chinese military hacker who was described in a security industry report in February and was said by the Justice Department on Monday to be a soldier named Wang Dong. "
European Regulators to Start Inquiry Into eBay Data Breach,"LONDON -- The fallout from the data breach at eBay has reached Europe. Next week, regulators here will begin an investigation into the online market after hackers gained access to the personal data of 145 million customers, said Gérard Lommel, president of the Luxembourg data protection authority, which oversees eBay on the Continent because the company's European headquarters are based in the small country.  Mr. Lommel said he met with eBay officials on Wednesday to discuss the data breach, and would begin the inquiry after discussing the issue with his colleagues on Monday. ''We have a big problem here,'' Mr. Lommel said in an interview. ''I'm a little bit astonished that no criminal use of the information has yet been detected.'' The investigation, which could take several months, will involve cooperation with other European regulators, as well as the potential involvement of United States authorities. Officials in Illinois, Florida and Connecticut are also looking into eBay's data breach. And in New York, the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has asked that the company provide free credit monitoring to those whose data was compromised. The Federal Bureau of Investigation office in San Francisco is investigating the breach. The F.B.I.'s spokesman, Peter D. Lee, said the agency hoped to bring the criminals responsible to ''swift justice'' but offered no timeline for arrests. Mr. Lommel said he had yet to contact his counterparts in the United States, though he had informed other European data authorities about his plans earlier this week. ''I expect that it will be a large exercise,'' he said. ''The investigation itself could take months, but the first few weeks will be the most decisive.'' While Luxembourg's data regulator does not have the authority to fine companies for privacy failures, the European watchdog can force them to change their internal procedures to correct any data protection flaws. It also can refer cases to the country's public prosecutor, who can bring criminal charges against companies or individuals. Those penalties could include fines totaling 125,000 euros, or $170,000, and jail terms of up to one year. Mr. Lommel added that the case against eBay would be unlikely to lead to prison sentences. ''We have relationships with and proactively contacted a number of state, federal and international regulators and law enforcement agencies,'' eBay said in a statement on Friday. ''We are fully cooperating with them on all aspects of this incident.'' Earlier this month, the European Union's highest court ruled against Google in a decision that allowed local citizens -- and possibly those outside the union -- to ask the search engine to take down links to information about themselves online. On Friday, Mr. Lommel of the Luxembourg data regulator said the growth of online data would most likely lead to more privacy breaches, as individuals increasingly upload personal information onto services run by some of the world's largest tech companies. ''We will have more and more nightmares,'' he said. ''It's impossible to know where this will end.'' "
A Tough Corporate Job Asks One Question: Can You Hack It?,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Pity the poor chief information security officer. The profession barely existed a generation ago. But to combat the growing threat of online breaches, companies and governments are hiring executives whose main responsibility is to make sure data systems are secure. When things go wrong -- and they often do -- these executives expect to bear the blame. ''We're like sheep waiting to be slaughtered,'' said David Jordan, the chief information security officer for Arlington County in Virginia. ''We all know what our fate is when there's a significant breach. This job is not for the fainthearted.''  Chief information security officers have one of the toughest jobs in the business world: They must stay one step ahead of criminal masterminds in Moscow and military hackers in Shanghai, check off a growing list of compliance boxes and keep close tabs on leaky vendors and reckless employees who upload sensitive data to Dropbox accounts and unlocked iPhones. They must be skilled in crisis management and communications, and expert in the most sophisticated technology, though they have come to learn the hard way that even the shiniest new security mousetraps are not foolproof. And they face a drumbeat of news about breaches -- like the arrest of a Russian this month on charges of hacking United States retailers -- that constantly reminds them of the stakes. ''We have to be correct 100 percent of the time,'' said Tom Kellermann, the chief information security officer at Trend Micro, a security firm. Cybercriminals, he said, ''must be correct once.'' A decade ago, few organizations had a dedicated chief information security officer, or CISO (pronounced SEE-so), as they are known. Now, more than half of corporations with 1,000 or more employees have a full- or part-time executive in the post, according to a study conducted last year by the Ponemon Institute, a research firm. Companies like VeriFone, the electronic payments systems provider; Brown-Forman, the beverage company; the Universities of North Carolina and Chicago; and younger upstarts like Fitbit, are all looking for dedicated security officers. Neiman Marcus, which suffered a major breach last year, is seeking its first one. The job has become so critical, recruiters say, that companies try to sweeten the deal. According to the study, they are dangling signing bonuses and salaries that range from $188,000 to $1.2 million, offering perks like the ability to work from home and generous time off, and promising larger budgets to buy more protection for porous systems. Still, it is seen as a thankless job. Many of the chief information security officers who took part in the Ponemon study rated their position as the most difficult in the organization. Most of those questioned said their job was a bad one, or the worst job they have ever had. When Target was breached last year, it did not have a fully dedicated chief information security officer; it hired its first one in June. Beth Jacobs, who oversaw Target's data protection, among other duties, was forced to resign. Gregg Steinhafel, the chief executive and board chairman, also lost his job. Stephen Fletcher, who supervised data security for the State of Utah, resigned after a breach two years ago revealed the personal data of 780,000 Medicaid recipients. In January, Justin Somaini, Yahoo's chief information security officer, left his post shortly before the company acknowledged a breach of some customers' newly revamped email accounts. The job is so pressured that many end up leaving -- voluntarily or not -- after two years, according to the Ponemon study. This compared with chief executives, who stick around for 10 years on average, according to other research. Of all the headaches that chief information security officers face, one of the biggest is figuring out which security products to trust. ''In the old days, there was a saying, 'Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM,' because you could trust IBM,'' said Andrew Caspersen, a former chief information security officer at Charles Schwab. ''But security firms have never been able to establish that level of credibility.'' What is more, while many information security officers agree that antivirus software, a traditional form of protection, fails to defend against modern-day threats, some say newer products are not much better. They also complain that it has become nearly impossible to evaluate products in the face of breathless marketing and fear. A report in March by NSS Labs, an independent research group, highlighted the problem. In comparing breach detection products, NSS Labs found that products sold by FireEye, Wall Street's one-time security darling, did not perform as well as Cisco's Sourcefire, Trend Micro and cheaper offerings from General Dynamics' Fidelis and Fortinet. The report immediately kicked off a dispute after FireEye called the methodology ''severely flawed,'' an assertion that NSS Labs challenged. And it sent FireEye's stock, which had tripled since its debut on the public market, into free fall. But security officers say the test did not tell them anything they did not already know. They say there is no silver bullet when it comes to breach defense. It is a matter of layering the most effective technologies, hiring the best people, then hoping for good luck. Candidates for a job as an information security officer are careful to have the difficult conversations up front, recruiters say. Before accepting an offer, some applicants want to be sure the board agrees that breaches are inevitable, and that they need to allocate a high enough percentage of the budget for information technology to security. ''If you know you're going to be sacrificed, you want a sufficient reason to take the job,'' said John Kindervag, a security analyst at the market research firm Forrester. ''People aren't talking about what we're doing to these poor people. We're putting all this complexity on their shoulders and then it's just 'Good luck!' '' To cope with such angst, many chief information security officers say they rely on humor. One joke -- recounted to this reporter three times in one week -- is the tale of the new security officer who meets his predecessor. The predecessor hands him three numbered envelopes and tells him to open them in an emergency. After a breach, the new security officer opens the first envelope. The message reads, ''Blame your predecessor.'' After a second breach, he opens the second, which suggests, ''Blame your staff.'' After a third breach, the security officer opens the third envelope. The message reads, ''Prepare three envelopes.'' "
Taiwan Investigates Xiaomi of China Over Cybersecurity Concerns,"TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan's government is investigating whether Xiaomi, China's leading smartphone company by domestic shipments, is a cybersecurity threat, according to a government website.  It was not immediately clear whether the investigation could lead to a ban for Xiaomi's low-priced smartphones in Taiwan. A decision would be made within three months, the Taiwan government said. Some Xiaomi phones automatically send user data to the firm's servers in Beijing, where the company is based, potentially leading to security breaches, according to the statement posted Tuesday on the website of Taiwan's executive branch. The inquiry is a reminder of the scrutiny Chinese technology firms are subject to abroad, as governments become increasingly wary of potential cybersecurity threats from China, the world's second-biggest economy. China's government and companies are frequently accused of industrial espionage and cyberespionage. Concerns are also mounting that Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, is overreliant on the mainland. Critics of Beijing argue that expanding economic ties allow China to influence Taiwan's fiercely democratic politics. The statement added that the popular Japanese instant messaging service Line, owned by Naver of South Korea, would be banned from use on government work-related computers, also because of security concerns. A Line spokeswoman based in Tokyo said the company was investigating the matter, but would not provide more details. Xiaomi declined to comment. The smartphone maker recently came under fire for unauthorized data access, spurring the company to upgrade its operating system and let users refuse to allow it to collect information from their address books. Although the vast majority of the company's sales are in China, Xiaomi has set up shop elsewhere in Asia, including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and India. It is also weighing expansion into countries such as Thailand, Brazil and Mexico. Trade ties between China and Taiwan have skyrocketed in recent years, though Taiwan still often views Chinese firms with suspicion. "
Obama Had Security Fears on JPMorgan Breach,"Updated, 9:57 p.m. | President Obama and his top national security advisers began receiving periodic briefings on the huge cyberattack at JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions this summer, part of a new effort to keep security officials as updated on major cyberattacks as they are on Russian incursions into Ukraine or attacks by the Islamic State. But in the JPMorgan case, according to administration officials familiar with the briefings, who would not speak on the record about intelligence matters, no one could tell the president what he most wanted to know: What was the motive of the attack? ''The question kept coming back, 'Is this plain old theft, or is Putin retaliating?' '' one senior official said, referring to the American-led sanctions on Russia. ''And the answer was: 'We don't know for sure.' '' More than three months after the first attacks were discovered, the source is still unclear and there is no evidence any money was taken from any institution.  But questions are being asked across Wall Street as other targets emerge. The F.B.I., after being contacted by JPMorgan, took the I.P. addresses the hackers were believed to have used to breach JPMorgan's system to other financial institutions, including Deutsche Bank and Bank of America, these people said. The purpose: to see whether the same intruders had tried to hack into their systems as well. The banks are also sharing information among themselves. In all, the authorities believe that the hackers may have tried to infiltrate about a dozen financial institutions, said one of the people briefed on the matter. Fidelity Investments and E*Trade are among those institutions that law enforcement officials believe were victimized in some way by the attacks, the person said. While Deutsche Bank and Bank of America scanned their systems, the people said, they did not find any evidence that the hackers had tried to get in. Adam Banker, a Fidelity spokesman, said, ''We have no indication that any Fidelity customer sites, accounts, information, services or systems were affected by this matter.'' E*Trade had no comment. Separately, at least five other banks -- ADP, Bank of the West, Citigroup, HSBC and Regions Financial -- found that one of the same web addresses used to penetrate JPMorgan had tried to get into their systems, people briefed on the matter said. But those companies may not necessarily be the focus of law enforcement. Citigroup and the Bank of the West declined to comment. Robert Sherman, an HSBC spokesman, said the bank ''takes its security and the security of its customer information very seriously,'' adding, ''We continue to monitor the situation closely, and are in touch with law enforcement and financial industry groups that collect and communicate cybersecurity information.'' Jim Duffy, an ADP spokesman, said the payroll processing firm had ''observed Internet-based traffic from those criminals allegedly reported'' to have hacked into JPMorgan. But he added that ADP had not ''observed any issues associated with such scanning of our defenses.'' Regions said in a statement that it ''consistently monitors for any unusual activity. At this point, we have no evidence of any breach.'' The other companies' names could not be learned Wednesday. JPMorgan has said that the attackers obtained names and some email addresses but did not penetrate enough to get account information, and that there was no evidence of any illicit movement of money across the 76 million affected households. The F.B.I. has begun a criminal inquiry into the attacks, and the Secret Service has been involved as well. But the scale and breadth of the attacks -- and the lack of clarity about the hackers' identity or motive -- show not only the vulnerability of the most heavily fortified American financial institutions but also the difficulty, despite billions of dollars spent in detection technology, in finding the sources of attack. And because it is so difficult to trace an attack to its source, it is next to impossible to deter one, security industry experts said. ''People don't pay a price for attacks,'' the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, said in an interview this year. ''It's one of our biggest challenges.'' [Video: Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, on cybersecurity. Watch on YouTube.] Other questions are being asked about what the obligation of financial institutions to report such attacks should be. A number of state attorneys general, led by Lisa Madigan of Illinois and George Jepsen of Connecticut, have opened investigations into the JPMorgan breach, according to the people briefed on the matter. The inquiries are looking at whether the bank, the nation's largest, alerted customers in a timely matter. A prolonged delay between when the bank learned that vast stores of information were pilfered and when it alerted customers could put consumers at risk, the people said. Under federal and state law, JPMorgan did not have to alert customers about the breach because it had determined that only contact data was breached. Prosecutors in Ms. Madigan's office were discussing whether to seek an update to a 2006 Illinois law that requires companies to alert consumers in a timely fashion if their financial information -- including Social Security and account numbers -- are taken. The debate now, the people said, is whether the law should also include notification requirements when hackers take nonfinancial information like email addresses. ''We communicated to customers repeatedly that we had been breached and hadn't seen unusual fraud levels related to this -- first in August, again in mid-September, and most recently last week,'' said Patricia Wexler, a JPMorgan spokeswoman. ''We were careful to get far enough along in our internal investigation to have the most complete information, and wanted to be sure we could confidently say no financial information had been compromised.'' On Tuesday, the offices of Ms. Madigan and Mr. Jepsen held a call with officials at JPMorgan to discuss the attack, the people said. Since the breach at Target last year, prosecutors from both states have been holding monthly calls -- part of a broader privacy task force. The data breach at JPMorgan Chase was among ''the most troubling breaches ever,'' Ms. Madigan said, adding that it proved ''there is probably no database that cybercriminals cannot compromise.'' JPMorgan has repeatedly said that none of the information taken -- names, phone numbers, addresses and emails -- has led to any episodes of fraud. Furthermore, it said that no money was stolen from customer accounts. But security consultants caution that email addresses may be enough information for hackers to engage in ''phishing'' expeditions to trick customers into providing them with additional personal information. The breach is under investigation by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, according to a person briefed on the matter. But actually finding the perpetrators of the attack is a daunting task. Thomas G. A. Brown, a senior managing director with FTI Consulting, knows firsthand the difficulty of tracking overseas criminals and bringing them to justice. Until recently, Mr. Brown was chief of the computer and intellectual property crime unit of the United States attorney's office in Manhattan. Mr. Brown oversaw the indictment of Aleksandr Kalinin, a Russian national charged with hacking into some of the computer systems of the Nasdaq stock market in 2011. Mr. Kalinin remains at large. Referring to the challenges of piecing together a portrait of the attackers, Mr. Brown said: ''It's not the equivalent of gunshots being fired, a body on the street, and witnesses who see a person with a gun running away.'' The search to determine exactly what the hackers took, and why, gained even more urgency last week, according to several people briefed on JPMorgan's internal investigation. The breach, discovered this summer, was far more extensive than the bank originally realized. This summer, some investigating it put the number of compromised accounts at around one million, according to two people briefed on the bank's internal investigation. By last week, as the investigation continued, the people said, that number had multiplied exponentially. Bank executives relayed the new details -- 76 million households compromised -- to its board. Other disclosures have been more subtle. In a regulatory filing in August, as the bank grappled with the breach, JPMorgan said its board and audit committee ''are regularly apprised'' of significant cybersecurity events. That language did not appear in an earlier filing from 2013 or in an earlier quarterly report. The scale of the intrusion and the fact it went undetected for about three weeks has led some to question whether JPMorgan, which has offices around the world and more than 260,000 employees, is ''too big to secure.''

"After JPMorgan Cyberattack, a Push to Fortify Wall Street Banks","This summer's huge cyberattack on JPMorgan Chase and a dozen other financial institutions is accelerating efforts by federal and state authorities to push banks and brokerage firms to close some gaping holes in their defenses. Top officials at the Treasury Department are discussing the need to bolster fortifications around a critical area of cybersecurity: outside vendors, which include law firms, accounting and marketing firms and even janitorial companies, according to several people briefed on the matter. The sweeping effort began before the hack on JPMorgan, which compromised some of the personal account information of 76 million households and seven million small businesses, the people said. Under discussion is a requirement that the banks put in place more stringent procedures and safeguards to make sure the outside firms have, at the least, basic defenses. The push by government officials is a stark acknowledgment of the vulnerability of financial institutions - even after they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to protect themselves - to an attack if one of their vendors is not fully prepared. The problem is causing some security consultants to privately consider whether the sprawling financial firms with operations across the globe may be ""too big to secure."" And smaller firms, the consultants say, may simply not have the ability to adequately defend customer information.  The attack on JPMorgan, along with earlier breaches at Target and Home Depot, has already made Americans wary of the security of their personal information. At a dinner in New York on Tuesday evening that is expected to include the general counsels from JPMorgan, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank, New York State's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky is expected to emphasize the gathering danger to the financial system when vendors' security is lax, according to one of the people briefed on the matter. The remarks, at the University Club in Midtown Manhattan, come as Mr. Lawsky is considering a new rule that would require banks to ""obtain representations and warranties"" from vendors about the adequacy of their controls to thwart hackers, the people said. As part of that proposal, Mr. Lawsky sent a letter on Tuesday to dozens of banks requesting that the firms provide ""any policies and procedures governing relationships with third-party service providers,"" according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The New York Times. In the letter, Mr. Lawsky says that banks must also outline ""the due diligence processes used to evaluate"" the security procedures of all vendors. ""It is abundantly clear that, in many respects,"" Mr. Lawsky said in the letter, ""a firm's level of cybersecurity is only as good as the cybersecurity of its vendors."" Mr. Lawsky's proposal mirrors some of the discussions underway at the Treasury Department, the people said. In July, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew highlighted the importance of cybersecurity to the global financial system in a speech at an investment conference. In that address, Mr. Lew said his deputy, Sarah Bloom Raskin, ""would be working with federal and state agencies to reduce cyber risks to the financial system,"" but he did not discuss the specific measures being considered. The increasingly urgent discussions reverberating through Washington and New York come as the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an audit of 50 firms to assess their readiness for cyberattacks as well as their relationships with vendors. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is conducting its own broad look at how American brokerage firms and asset management firms deal with assaults from hackers and how they oversee their vendors. Other regulators are examining the preparedness of 500 community banks and credit union for dealing with an attack. Wall Street's reliance on third-party vendors has come under fire before, most prominently in the aftermath of the financial crisis, when banks used outside law firms to handle mass foreclosures in what turned into a flawed process. Those practices led to a landmark $25 billion foreclosure abuse settlement between the government and five major banks two years ago. The latest scrutiny of vendors signals a new recognition that cybercrime represents one of the greatest threats to the stability of the financial system. In attack after attack, hackers are rebuffed by financial institutions only to slip through the cracks at vendors, including some that have virtually no security. The attack that roiled Target last year and exposed the information of 40 million cardholders and 70 million others came from hackers breaking into the security system of a heating and cooling contractor that was doing work for the retailer. The same overseas hackers that breached JPMorgan's network also infiltrated the website for the JPMorgan Corporate Challenge, which is run by an outside vendor for the bank on a server maintained by an Internet firm in Ann Arbor, Mich. JPMorgan discovered the attack on the Corporate Challenge website on Aug. 7, and learned of the far broader breach of its own system about a week later. The attack on the bank's network - which enabled the hackers to gain a high level of system privileges on more than 90 servers - began sometime in June and went undiscovered by JPMorgan for about two months, said another person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly. The length of the attack - a two-month period when hackers roamed freely through JPMorgan's systems - has not been previously reported. Two months may seem a long time for largely unfettered access to JPMorgan, but security consultants note it is not uncommon for hackers to rummage through a big company's network for several months before being detected. Federal authorities believe the hackers, some of whom may be from Russia, were not acting with the backing of a foreign government and were motivated solely by profit. JPMorgan said no financial information was taken and it has not seen any evidence of fraud from the information taken in the attacks on its computers and the Corporate Challenge website, which included names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. Still, it remains unclear just how the hackers got into JPMorgan's network, and the bank has determined that they did not gain access to JPMorgan's computer systems through the Corporate Challenge website. ""We have no evidence to indicate that attackers compromised a third party to gain access to our network as part of this incident,"" Patricia Wexler, a JPMorgan spokeswoman said, referring broadly to vendor security. Still, security consultants and government officials are zeroing in on vendors as they work to choke off access to the global financial system. ""I would put vendor security as a top concern,"" said John Reed Stark, former chief of the S.E.C.'s Office of Internet Enforcement and a managing director at Stroz Friedberg, a data breach response firm. ""I am certainly seeing more and more entities being very rigorous when it comes to their relationships with third parties and cybersecurity."" ""In some contracts, companies even contractually secure the right to require, in the event of a breach or compromise, that the vendor conduct an independent risk and security audit at the vendor's own expense,"" Mr. Stark said. The notion of requiring financial institutions to get ""reps and warranties"" from vendors about their security might make it difficult for smaller firms to sell their wares and services to banks and brokers and harder for smaller financial firms to pay for them. But at the same time, beefing up vendor security could prove an important way to quarantine an attack. Susan F. Axelrod, executive vice president of regulatory operations at the financial industry's regulating agency, said financial firms not only needed to improve their criteria in hiring vendors but also continue to monitor the providers for security during the course of a contract and then pay particular attention to what happens when a vendor's work is done. ""The process of terminating a relationship is key,"" Ms. Axelrod said. ""You have to immediately terminate vendor access and passwords."" She suggested that contracts with vendors ""deal upfront"" with the process of ending a relationship and safeguarding access to a firm's computer network. By the end of the year, the agency expects to publish what it considers best practices for dealing with vendors and cybersecurity, a product of its review of 18 large to midsize brokerage firms.

R.B.S. to Aid Police in Unraveling Financial Crimes,"LONDON - The Royal Bank of Scotland, which is 81 percent owned by British taxpayers, has negotiated a new deal, though not one that is likely to help them in the league tables. The bank signed a ""landmark agreement"" to help the City of London police tackle complex financial crime.   Similar to banks' hiring hackers to protect their computer systems, the deal appears to be an attempt to tap the expertise of bankers to catch their peers. Areas of cooperation will include ""equities and markets, financial instruments, international jurisdictions, cybertechnology and foreign languages,"" a description that conjures up images of traders teaching police how to decipher Dutch derivatives.  ""Entering into this volunteer scheme will give the force access to the type of expertise and advice that will greatly assist our detectives when dealing with the most complex and challenging cases of economic crime, building on the support we already receive from our Special Constabulary and other force volunteers,"" Adrian Leppard, the City of London police commissioner and national policing lead for fraud, said in a statement.  The police were quick to assure citizens that their detectives were already highly trained but recognized that the insider knowledge could be of benefit with the rise of cybersecurity issues.  Institutions are on the defensive after a highly publicized cyberattack on JPMorgan Chase this year that compromised the accounts of 76 million households and seven million small businesses.   Regulators have been consistently criticized for not having the expertise to combat some of the most sophisticated and well-paid financial innovators and engineers in the world. They counter that they do not have the deep pockets of banks or hedge funds to pay for the talent. The deal with R.B.S. appears to be a stab at dealing with the mismatch.  ""Signing this agreement with R.B.S., which we hope will be the first of many with the financial sector, means we can now tap into their massive knowledge base of financial products and digital technology and use their foreign language skills, which reflects the increasingly international dimension of economic crime investigation,"" Mr. Leppard said. The bankers will not be involved in any police operations and will not be asked to advise on information related to specific investigations.  That might preclude the bank from helping on several issues. R.B.S., like many of its counterparts, is mired in many legal investigations and settlements, including the manipulation of foreign currency markets and the inappropriate sale of mortgage and loan insurance products.  Last week, the bank set aside 780 million pounds, or $1.2 billion, to cover potential fines and lawsuits stemming from regulatory investigations. The charges include £400 million to cover potential fines and litigation costs related to the currency market investigation. Ross McEwan, who took over as chief executive a little more than a year ago, is drastically shrinking the bank and refocusing its global ambitions toward its home market.  At a recent banking conference, Mr. McEwan said R.B.S. was not trusted enough by its customers.  ""I put trust at the heart of our strategy,"" he said.   Trust, and better relations with the police.                        "
"In About-Face, Sony Will Show Film in Dispute","LOS ANGELES -- ''The Interview,'' the raucous comedy that became the center of a dispute over cybersecurity between the United States and North Korea, will be released in a small number of theaters on Christmas Day after all, Sony Pictures said on Tuesday. The development gave new life to a film that Sony had pulled from distribution last week, after hackers threatened violence against any theater that played it. Sony also left open the door to video-on-demand availability of the movie, either simultaneously with its debut in theaters, or nearly so. In announcing the new plan on Tuesday, Michael Lynton, Sony Pictures' chairman, said his studio was continuing efforts ''to secure more platforms and more theaters so that this movie reaches the largest possible audience.'' ''Freedom has prevailed! Sony didn't give up!'' Seth Rogen, who co-directed, co-wrote and co-stars in ''The Interview,'' wrote on Twitter.  A comedy about the assassination of North Korea's ruler, Kim Jong-un, ''The Interview'' was withdrawn by Sony last week after theater chains refused to play it in the face of a terror threat. Though Sony was privately searching for new outlets, the aborted release led to a chorus of protest, as irate Hollywood stars, free-speech advocates and even President Obama complained that Sony had capitulated to extortionist demands to cancel the release. On Friday, hours after the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified North Korea as ''centrally involved'' in a cyberattack of Sony and the subsequent terror threat, Mr. Obama elevated the issue from a serious industry problem to one involving national security and artistic expression. ''We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States,'' Mr. Obama told reporters. Following Mr. Obama's rebuke, Sony stepped up its campaign to secure a release. Mr. Lynton, who had already been searching for alternatives, insisted to CNN and NPR last Friday that the studio had not caved, and that it was scrambling to find new distribution. David Boies, a Sony lawyer, delivered the same message on ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday. Over the last day Sony reached out again to the big multiplex operators asking if they would rebook the film, according to people briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because negotiations were continuing. Sony on Tuesday had so far patched together release of ''The Interview'' in about 200 smaller theaters, including the Plaza in Atlanta and roughly 20 venues operated by Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, a chain based in Texas. Some theaters reported near-instant sellouts for Thursday screenings. Still, a run of that size would be largely symbolic in financial terms for Sony, which spent $44 million to make the film and had planned to release it on more than 2,000 North American screens. It appeared unlikely on Tuesday that major exhibitors would come back on board, as security concerns were compounded by anger over Sony's handling of ''The Interview.'' North America's four largest chains -- Regal, AMC, Cinemark and Carmike -- either declined to comment or did not respond to queries. Advertising will largely take place on social media. Though modest, the new release plan is a positive turn of events for Mr. Lynton and Amy Pascal, Sony Pictures' co-chairwoman, who were battered for canceling the release. But the decision to move ahead with limited distribution begins a new period of disquiet for the studio and its partners. The hacker group that digitally ransacked Sony and threatened theaters with violence had warned that a digital assault would resume if new distribution plans were made. In addition to the furor over ''The Interview,'' Sony has suffered the disclosure of tens of thousands of emails, personnel files and other private data since Nov. 24. Mr. Obama said the United States would take action in response to the Sony attack, leading North Korea, which has denied responsibility, to warn of ''serious consequences'' if the United States made any such move. Theater owners and government officials have been trying to assess the credibility of the terrorism threat, which came on Dec. 16 and warned of 9/11-scale violence if ''The Interview'' was released. Initially, the F.B.I. had guided theaters to treat the missive like a bomb threat -- credible until it could be proved otherwise. But law enforcement agencies have in recent days softened that assessment, according to people briefed on the matter. The art-house theaters showing the film might still take unusual security measures, perhaps by banning backpacks or packages or posting signs advising customers of added risk, said people briefed on their plans. Even so, the theaters taking ''The Interview'' face security issues less severe than any that multiplexes would have come up against. Many of America's 500 or so art houses, for instance, are located away from shopping malls; mall operators initially objected to the showing of a film under explicit threat. Keeping ''The Interview'' away from multiplexes would also reduce any collateral damage for Sony competitors, some of whom aggressively pushed exhibitors to drop the film to protect ticket sales for their holiday releases. Competing studios had privately argued that, even if the threat was not credible, having ''The Interview'' on theater marquees could prompt ticket buyers to stay away, hurting films playing in the same complex. A new facet of Sony's discussions with theater owners is any simultaneous video-on-demand effort. Studios typically give theaters an exclusive monthslong window to play new movies. Most theaters, worried about the impact on ticket sales, remain adamant about refusing to open their doors to any film that is showing or about to show through other channels. It remained unclear, however, whether any on-demand service would take ''The Interview.'' According to people briefed on the matter, Sony had in recent days asked the White House for help in lining up a single technology partner -- Apple, which operates iTunes -- but the tech company was not interested, at least not on a speedy time table. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. On Tuesday, Eric Schultz, a White House press secretary, said that Mr. Obama welcomed the decision to release the film. ''As the president made clear, we're a country that believes in free speech and the right of artistic expression,'' he said. Finding a new delivery route has been complicated. Satellite operators, cable systems and online platforms worried that they would become hacking targets if they picked up the film. The studio early on ruled out its own video site, Crackle. That streaming service is free, and Sony has a contractual financial obligation to various profit participants in ''The Interview'' to exhaust all paid options. YouTube was eliminated as an option for the same reason, among others. A spokesman for LStar Capital, which helped finance ''The Interview,'' declined to comment. Unclear on Tuesday was precisely how Sony arrived at the decision to mount a limited theatrical release. A group called Art House Convergence may have played a role; on Monday it told Sony it had found about 250 small theaters willing to play the film. "
Cyberdeal Hits the Sweet Spot,"At first glance, the latest cybersecurity deal looks like a breach of logic. FireEye's market value shot up by a third on Friday, a move worth $1.6 billion, more than it said it had spent to buy Mandiant. The deal marries FireEye's threat protection with its target's capabilities to respond to cyberattacks after they happen. Even with the industrial fit, the welcome from investors was unusually warm.  The explanation may be a convergence of hot security and takeover trends. For starters, both FireEye and the privately held Mandiant are arguably the best in their businesses, showing how upstarts have gained the upper hand on larger, established companies in fighting the latest online threats. FireEye, whose shares had already more than doubled since its September 2013 initial public offering, claims more than 100 of the Fortune 500 among its customers. Mandiant, meanwhile, aims to step in pretty much any time a prominent company's cyberdefenses are cracked, as when The  New York Times was hacked early last year. The security consultancy subsequently produced a widely cited report exposing a Chinese government-linked computer espionage unit. Already a sizzling - if specialized - area, cyberprotection received a huge lift in attention after the security contractor Edward Snowden leaked information on the scale of United States government spying programs last year. Add news of a holiday attack that compromised the credit or debit cards of 40 million customers of the retailer Target, and it's hardly surprising if investors become more excited about the sector in 2014. There's also a broader M.&A. phenomenon at work. A buyer's shares typically fall when a deal is announced because paying a premium gives away value and integrating an acquisition brings risks. Last year, though, acquirers were rewarded more frequently than usual with a stock rise. That suggests investors are more than usually receptive, at least to manageably sized and sensible deals. FireEye's purchase of Mandiant is smack in the middle of what should be a 2014 sweet spot.   Richard Beales is assistant editor for Reuters Breakingviews.

A Little Less Tech Luster in Cambridge,"LONDON - On the streets of East London, signs of the city's blossoming tech scene are hard to miss. Co-working spaces are filled with eager young developers, prominent tech companies like Google have opened local offices here and the British government has earmarked millions of pounds to upgrade the creaking tech infrastructure of the country's capital. Yet only an hour north of London lies a rival tech cluster that may have had a greater economic impact than anything so far created on the banks of the Thames.  Cambridge - home to one of the world's oldest universities and some successful tech companies - remains one of Europe's largest tech communities. Within Cambridge is a well-connected group of early-stage investors. Paired with the university's scientists, who have a track record of spinning off their ideas into new businesses, and the local talent pool of engineers, the city has helped several tech companies gain international reputations. The city, in the eastern part of England, is the home base for ARM Holdings, a designer of semiconductors and one of Britain's largest tech firms, with a market valuation of around $22.4 billion. The British software maker Autonomy, which was sold to Hewlett-Packard for $11.1 billion in 2011, also was founded in Cambridge. The deal is being investigated after Hewlett wrote down $8.8 billion from the acquisition on potential accounting problems at Autonomy. The company's British founder, Mike Lynch, has denied the accusations. And international tech giants like Microsoft and Toshiba have large research teams in the city. Smaller start-ups in sectors including biotechnology and data security fill office parks in and around Cambridge. ""This is where people are generating new ideas every day,"" said Steve Huxter, managing director of Darktrace, a local cybersecurity tech firm that grew out of research at the University of Cambridge. ""We need to be close to scientists. The most natural place to do what we do is Cambridge."" Despite the city's established pedigree, analysts say Cambridge is starting to lose some of its shine compared with London's tech industry. Local start-ups, for example, raised $130 million in venture capital last year, one-sixth of what was raised by their London-based counterparts, according to the data provider DJX VentureSource. And while Cambridge tech companies have focused on niches within areas like hardware development and biotechnology, London start-ups have focused on consumer technologies like media and games applications that have garnered greater interest from engineers wanting to work on the next big thing. When Chris Morton graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2003, for example, he never dreamed of starting a local tech company. Yet after working at a venture capital firm in London, Mr. Morton founded Lyst, a fashion online marketplace, here in 2010. The tech start-up now has offices in London and New York, sells around $60 million of high-end products annually on its site and announced on Friday that it had raised an additional $14 million from a consortium of local venture firms. ""When I left Cambridge, I didn't know much about the local start-up industry,"" Mr. Morton said. ""If you're going to be a consumer Internet business, you need to be where your customers are. For us, that could only be London."" Ties between entrepreneurs and investors in the two cities, which are 60 miles apart, are still strong, and companies actively hire developers and engineers from both areas, according to Ian Thornton, vice president for investor relations at ARM Holdings. But London's lead could be extended if some of the city's companies, like the online gaming firm Mind Candy and the Internet food delivery service Just Eat, go forward with potential initial public offerings in the near future, analysts say. To cement London's position, some investors are trying to persuade local tech firms to list in the city, instead of taking their companies to American rivals like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The London Stock Exchange recently appointed Joanna Shields, a former Google and Facebook executive, to its board. Ms. Shields previously ran the Tech City Investment Organization, a British governmental body aimed at attracting investment to East London's technology sector, who has actively called for new I.P.O.'s from London tech companies. ""We're trying to build the next group of companies to list here,"" Ms. Shields said in an interview in December before her new position was announced. ""The London markets need to prove to tech firms that we are worthy of them.""  "
Top British Spy Warns of Terrorists' Use of Social Media,"LONDON -- One of Britain's highest-ranking intelligence officials on Tuesday castigated the giant American companies that dominate the Internet for providing the ''command-and-control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals'' and challenged the companies to find a better balance between privacy and security. The statements were made by Robert Hannigan, the newly appointed director of GCHQ, Britain's electronic intelligence agency. They were among the most pointed in a campaign by intelligence services in Britain and the United States against pressure to rein in their digital surveillance after disclosures by the American former contractor Edward J. Snowden.  Mr. Hannigan's statements were among the most critical of American technology firms by the head of a major intelligence agency; the accusation went beyond what United States officials have said about Apple, Google and others that are now moving toward sophisticated encryption of more and more data on phones and email systems. But the companies, saying they are responding to demand from their users, show no signs of backing down. Recently the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook, said governments that want data should deal with the users of the technology, not with the providers of the hardware and services. Brad Smith, the general counsel of Microsoft Corporation, told a Harvard Law School symposium on Tuesday that, if anything, companies like his ''will move to strengthen encryption,'' and require governments to get court orders if they want data. Mr. Hannigan, in an opinion article on Tuesday in The Financial Times, singled out the Islamic State, the radical group also known as ISIS and ISIL, as one ''whose members have grown up on the Internet'' and are ''exploiting the power of the web to create a jihadi threat with near-global reach.'' In a speech two weeks ago, the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, said that the ''post-Snowden pendulum'' had ''gone too far.'' On Monday, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, took a less confrontational approach, telling students and faculty members at Stanford University that ''a fundamentally strong Internet is in the best interest of the U.S.'' Increasingly encrypted products and services are ''a challenge,'' Admiral Rogers said. ''And we'll deal with it.'' But he also pushed for better sharing of data between the intelligence community and private technology companies. Moves to set up a formal information-sharing system have stalled in Congress in the face of objections from the private sector. ''It is unrealistic to expect the private sector to withstand the actions of nation-states,'' Admiral Rogers said. ''I think it is also unrealistic to expect the government to deal with this all by itself. '' Technology companies, which harvest customer data for commercial uses, reacted cautiously on Tuesday, generally seeking to avoid any role that would make them agents of government intelligence-gathering. ''It's such a slippery slope with these types of requests,'' said Stefan Weitz, director of search at Microsoft. ''If you say yes to one request, more will inevitably start to come in. At what point do you stop?'' Technology companies do cooperate with governments in some ways. In Britain, government agencies have regular contact with Google and its YouTube subsidiary, and can get expedited responses when they raise concerns about terror recruitment videos or images of beheadings, often resulting in quick action to take down the content in question. But Mr. Hannigan's comments, calling for ''a new deal between democratic governments and the technology companies in the area of protecting our citizens,'' seemed to urge a further review of the balance between civil liberties and national security. Britain, like other European nations, has been increasingly concerned about online recruitment of potential fighters from within its borders by radical groups. Mr. Hannigan's statement drew opposition from civil liberties groups. ''It is not for the head of a powerful intelligence agency to wave his arms and expect citizens of a democracy to gladly give up their rights,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research group in Washington. ''His responsibility is to protect their freedoms.'' GCHQ, which stands for Government Communications Headquarters, operates closely with the British domestic security service, MI5; the overseas intelligence service, MI6; and the United States National Security Agency. ''Privacy has never been an absolute right,'' Mr. Hannigan wrote, ''and the debate about this should not become a reason for postponing urgent and difficult decisions.'' Technology companies have been vocal in insisting that they comply with government demands to hand over information about their users only when they are mandated by court orders. Facebook said in a company blog post that requests by governments for user information were rising steadily, by about a quarter in the first half of the year over the second half of last year. ''In the first six months of 2014, governments around the world made 34,946 requests for data,'' the post said. ''During the same time, the amount of content restricted because of local laws increased about 19 percent.'' Twitter received more than 2,000 requests for information about user accounts from roughly 50 countries in the first six months of 2014, according to a company statement. The number of requests represented a 46 percent increase compared with the same period last year, and more than 60 percent of the requests came from the United States government. In the past, Al Qaeda and its affiliates, which have broken with the Islamic State, ''saw the Internet as a place to disseminate material anonymously or meet in 'dark spaces,' '' Mr. Hannigan wrote, while the Islamic State ''has embraced the web as a noisy channel in which to promote itself, intimidate people and radicalize new recruits.'' The opinion article by Mr. Hannigan referred specifically to messaging and social media sites and apps such as Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. ''There is no need for today's would-be jihadis to seek out restricted websites with secret passwords: They can follow other young people posting their adventures in Syria as they would anywhere else,'' he wrote. "
Privacy Please: Tools to Shield Your Smartphone,"Here's a thought: Maybe it's O.K. to care about your privacy even if you have nothing to hide. Millions of us share our most personal sentiments and our most potentially damaging data through our smartphones. They're the most personal communication devices we own, and they are compromised to the hilt. It is time to lock them down. A deluge of news about National Security Agency phone-sniffing and hacks on supposedly private services like Snapchat, not to mention revelations about leaky mobile phone apps, has kept smartphone privacy in the spotlight. Now a handful of companies are offering tools to help close some of the security gaps. Soon, the average person will have access to what amounts to a secure phone: It's called the Blackphone. Available for pre-orders on Monday, it has been built from scratch with security in mind. It can do texting, video, calling, searching, browsing, file storage and sharing -- all shielded from the prying eyes of governments and hackers.  The phone is being built by the Spanish phone maker GeeksPhone and Silent Circle, a communications security company headed by Phil Zimmermann, who created the encryption program known as P.G.P., or ''Pretty Good Privacy.'' Zimmermann then founded Silent Circle, which provides encrypted texting and mobile phone calling for $10 to $24 a month. Few details are available about the phone and what it might cost. Its website displays a stylish and ominous introductory video and a basic feature list. It's available unlocked (not tied to one carrier) and can run on any global system for mobile communications (G.S.M.) network: T-Mobile, AT&T and a handful of prepaid carriers in the United States. While Blackphone is an intriguing concept, some of its features can be had already through Silent Circle, which offers subscriptions for iOS and Android. The $10-a-month option encrypts voice, video, texting and file communications sent to anyone who is also using Silent Circle Mobile. The more expensive plan encrypts your end of a phone call to a mobile or landline, even if the person on the other end isn't a subscriber. Cheaper options exist for more secure iOS and Android communications that can help you create your own Blackphone, or at least come close. All of them require the person on the other end to install the same app. Let's start with texting and instant messaging. Android currently has the best options available for secure messaging. My favorite is the free TextSecure from WhisperSystems. It encrypts text messages between users, as long as you both have the app installed and you use it for texting instead of your regular app. The texts are encrypted as they're sent back and forth and stay encrypted when they are stored on your phone. TextSecure is based on open-source software and makes its source code available for anyone to see. That, according to security experts, is the key to trust. If you can't see a product's source code, you can't guarantee that it hasn't been compromised by a hacker or government backdoor. It's like publication in a scientific journal: Even if you don't understand the science, you at least know it has been peer-reviewed. The only drawback to TextSecure is that it's not yet available for iOS. But WhisperSystems told me it would be submitted to the Apple App Store by the end of March. If you want encrypted messaging across iOS and Android, try ChatSecure, created by the Guardian Project, a collection of developers, activists and hackers who create tools for more secure communications. This free app doesn't replace texting; instead, it lets you send encrypted messages over a number of existing chat services like Facebook Chat, Google Talk, Google Hangouts, Jabber and some others. You must have an account with one of those, and your recipient must also install ChatSecure. But since the app is free and available on virtually any device, it's a good way to encrypt messaging across some common chat services. ChatSecure is also open source. When it comes to calling, the options are simpler -- because there aren't many. One option is the Silent Circle Mobile subscription mentioned earlier, which works on iOS and Android to encrypt voice and video communications. Then there's RedPhone, also from WhisperSystems, currently available only on Android. RedPhone is free, simple to use and, once installed, disappears into your phone's dialer. If you're calling someone who also uses the app, you'll see an option to ''upgrade'' to an encrypted call. When you dial, you hear entertaining sound effects meant to sound like encryption in progress. It's charming and reassuring. The process works by encrypting the voice data and then routing it through the data network (Wi-Fi, 3G or LTE) instead of over a standard voice channel. So the phone company can't listen to your calls, and your carrier or the wireless network provider can only see encrypted data. The only possible concern is that the calls now use data instead of voice minutes. If you have a low allotment, you might want to limit your chat time. Also, call quality is not as good as over the mobile network. WhisperSystems seems to know this and offers to let you rate each call once it has ended. Whisper says the app should be submitted to Apple for approval by the end of February. Another common security failure on your mobile phone is browsing. Your search data, location and personal information can all be gathered while you surf, either by your carrier, government snoops or hackers. Consider a secure browser or browsing app for your phone. On Android, the Guardian Project has you covered. Its no-cost Orweb browser and companion Orbot apps offer private browsing that frees you from cookies, stops network providers from viewing your web travels and disables security threats. It also doesn't keep a browsing history. Used in conjunction with Orbot, Orweb can mask your identity when you try to access sites that might be monitored, censored or located outside your home country. Orbot routes your surfing and searching through the Tor network, a distributed system of communicating that prevents monitors from seeing web traffic or where it originated. Orweb and Orbot aren't available for iOS, but a good alternative is the $1 Onion Browser, which, like Orbot, routes your surfing through the Tor network. For lighter-weight protection, you can use the private browsing modes in Safari or Chrome (on Android or iOS) to make sure your browser isn't saving your data, browsing history or cookies once you exit. It's worth noting that none of these options are completely secure, especially not if you have Angry Birds running alongside the Onion Browser and if your carrier is storing encrypted data until some computer powerful enough to break it comes along. But they're a good start to securing at least some of your communications. Go forth and be more private. "
Upgrades Are Ordered to Protect People's Data,"President Obama signed an executive order on Friday to strengthen security on federally issued credit cards and government payment systems, part of a push to protect Americans from identity theft and fraud after several large-scale data security breaches this year.  ''You should be able to buy the things that you need without risking your identity, your credit score or your savings,'' Mr. Obama said during an appearance at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau before signing the directive. The order requires government agencies and offices to upgrade the technologies they use to protect consumer data. That might mean using payment terminals and cards that have difficult-to-clone microchips and that use personal identification number verification. The government issues credit cards to federal employees to cover work expenses and distributes some federal benefits, like Social Security, pension and veterans' payments, using debit cards issued to recipients. The order also directs federal officials, including those at the National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget, to present a plan for agencies that make personal data available digitally that would protect the information through multiple layers of identity authentication or other means. ''No one security measure, no matter how powerful, can stop fraud on its own,'' Mr. Obama said. He said he was directing federal law enforcement officials to share more information with the private sector when they discover identity theft rings. In addition, the president said the Federal Trade Commission would add features to its IdentityTheft.gov site and work with credit bureaus to hasten the resolution of identity theft cases. Mr. Obama also called on Congress to replace the current patchwork of data security laws in the states with ''one clear national standard that brings certainty to businesses and keeps consumers safe.'' At the signing, Mr. Obama said he, too, had experienced difficulties with his credit card -- most recently last month, when he tried to pay for a meal at a restaurant in New York. ''My credit card was rejected,'' he said, making small talk as he signed the executive order. ''I guess I don't use it enough, so they thought there was some fraud going on. ''Fortunately,'' the president said, ''Michelle had hers.'' "
Florida and F.T.C. Accuse Firms of Deceptively Selling Tech Support,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Trade Commission and the State of Florida on Wednesday announced that they had obtained a court order to temporarily shut down and freeze the assets of two telemarketing operations that the commission said had deceptively sold more than $120 million in technical support services and software.  Using a variety of company names, including Boost Software, Advanced Tech Supportco, OMG Tech Help, Vast Tech Support and PC Vitalware, the companies used software designed to trick consumers into thinking their computers had bugs or errors that needed to be fixed, officials from the two agencies argued in papers filed in federal court in Florida. The companies then directed consumers to support services that were ""high-pressure deceptive sales pitches"" for products to fix nonexistent computer problems, officials said. ""These operations prey on consumers' lack of technical knowledge with deceptive pitches and high-pressure tactics to sell useless software and services,"" said Jessica L. Rich, director of the F.T.C.'s bureau of consumer protection. The agency is seeking disgorgement of profits and restitution to victims. Consumers found themselves the targets of the companies when they clicked  on pop-up advertisements or search results tied to common computer terms. The ads offered free software that purported to scan a computer's system and locate malicious or otherwise dangerous files. ""The scan is designed to falsely identify problems on consumers' computers, exaggerate minor issues and otherwise deceive consumers into thinking that their computers are significantly compromised,"" the F.T.C. said in papers filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. In one example, a program offered by the companies named PC Cleaner Pro scans a target's computer to see whether it has the ability to block 926 specific pieces of malware. ""These particular 926 pieces of malware, however, date back to at least 2004 and have not been active threats in many years,"" the F.T.C. said. In many cases, Microsoft fixed those problems so long ago that it no longer includes the specific blocking software in its preinstalled Windows Defender anti-malware program - resulting in nearly all of them being identified as problems on nearly any computer. The program then offers a consumer the chance to fix the ""problems"" with a paid version of PC Cleaner Pro. Once they pay $29.99 for the program, consumers must call a toll-free number to ""activate"" the software, and when they do, they are subjected to high-pressure sales tactics for more services. Those services, including security software and remote tech support services, cost consumers as much as $500 if they signed up, the F.T.C. said. From 2011 to 2013, the F.T.C. said, consumers downloaded PC Cleaner Pro more than 450,000 times. One of the individual defendants in the Boost Software case is Elliot Loewenstern, an officer of Vast Tech Support and OMG Tech Help. Mr. Loewenstern was a top broker at Stratton Oakmont, the firm founded by Jordan Belfort and chronicled in the film ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" In 1999, Mr. Loewenstern was barred from the securities industry for life in a  settlement of fraud charges for his actions running Biltmore Securities. "
"More Security, Fewer Passwords","Among all the shiny gadgets at the International CES, software often gets short shrift, especially unglamorous software for things like authentication. But advances in authentication may do more to change the way you use devices and buy items online than anything else here in Las Vegas, for two reasons: the advances make your devices and data more secure, and, best of all, could mean the end of passwords.  Lest you think this is small potatoes, consider the work of FIDO, for Fast Identity Online. The group, which has representatives from Google, PayPal, Microsoft and MasterCard on its board and those companies among its financial backers, is trying to establish standards so that sites and devices can reliably recognize various forms of authentication - fingerprints, voice, or USB key cards, for instance. One advantage to these kinds of authentication is that you can't share them, and it's awfully hard to steal them. One product displayed at the show comes from Agnition, which uses voice recognition for authentication. As the company points out, you can tell someone your password, but they still can't say it with your voice. And while a studio-quality recording might foil voice recognition, it could require you to say your phrase more than once. If the phrases are exactly identical - which no human could manage - the system knows it is being spoofed. Other companies in the group have developed fingerprint readers, ultrasound readers and Iris readers. Apple has already moved in this direction with its fingerprint recognition that unlocks the iPhone 5s and allows iTunes purchases. About a dozen companies are already producing FIDO-ready products that should work with the coming standard. A working specification will be released in the first quarter, the company says.  "
Target's Woes May Be a Boon for Security Firms,"Target's security breach isn't bad news for everyone. One company that stands to benefit: Experian, a credit data company whose investors include BlackRock and Artisan Partners Holdings.  On Monday, Target announced it had hired Experian to provide customers with a free year of credit-monitoring in the wake of a security breach that left at least 70 million people vulnerable to identity theft. Consumers have until April 23 to sign up for the service, which will entitle them to a free copy of their credit report and daily credit monitoring. Experian and Target declined to comment on how much Target would pay for the service. Experian will be providing Target customers with its ProtectMyID alert product, which typically costs $15.95 a month and $159.95 for the full year.  On Friday, Target raised the number of people it said may have been affected by the security breach to 70 million to 110 million customers. The stolen credit card and other private information represents one of the largest retail data thefts in history. Target has also hired security firms including Mandiant, which was recently acquired by the security software company FireEye for $1 billion, to help with its internal investigation into the breach. Mandiant declined to comment on the companies' payment arrangement, but comparable services could cost anywhere from $200,000 to more than a million dollars. Manufacturers of security chips used in credit cards, a standard known as E.M.V. (for Europay, MasterCard and Visa) could also stand to benefit. The United States has been slow to adopt the chips, which are widely used across Europe. Brandon Kuehl, the product manager at the Members Group, a card processing and payment solutions company, estimated that perhaps 5 percent of all American credit cards are equipped with the technology, which makes it harder to use credit card information after it's been stolen. Credit card issuers and their affiliated companies have entrenched payment infrastructure systems in place, and putting E.M.V. chips on every card could be expensive. But in the wake of a major identity theft, consumers could put more pressure on banks and other credit card companies to institute a change. ""You kind of need everybody to collectively get their act together before you'll see real full penetration in this area,"" said Justin Cappos, a computer security expert at New York University's Polytechnic School of Engineering. ""But judging by the number of high-profile breaches we've had in the past couple of years, I would think there might be some momentum building to make a change."" Additionally, Visa, MasterCard and other credit card companies have warned that card issuers, merchants and processors could be liable for security breaches if they aren't equipped with E.M.V. protections by 2015.  ""We're still a long way away from that,"" Mr. Kuehl said. ""Even on that date we only anticipate that 60 percent of both issuers and merchants will be E.M.V. capable.""  "
Barclays and Regulators Look at Possible Theft of Customer Data,"The headaches keep coming for Barclays. The bank, one of the largest in Britain, announced on Sunday that it was investigating the possible theft and sale of personal data concerning at least 2,000 customers. British regulators also are looking into the case.  Barclays said an initial investigation suggested that the breach was limited to customers from its financial planning business, which was closed in 2011. The personal data appears to have been collected from 2008 and earlier, the bank said in a statement. Barclays said it was notifying customers that their information might have been stolen. ""Protecting our customers' data is a top priority, and we take this issue extremely seriously,"" Giles Croot, a Barclays spokesman, said. ""This appears to be criminal action, and we will cooperate with the authorities on pursuing the perpetrator."" The Financial Conduct Authority confirmed that Barclays had contacted it about the matter. The authority said it planned to work with the bank on procedures to ""ensure data is secure and used properly."" It is an awkward time for Barclays, which plans to announce its annual results on Tuesday. It has been in the spotlight, with other major banks, over broad inquiries into accusations that it rigged benchmark interest rates. The bank said recently that its fourth-quarter results would include additional charges of 110 million pounds, or $180 million, related to litigation and regulatory penalties. The Financial Conduct Authority's investigation into the possible data theft adds a layer to the regulatory inquiries into the bank. In 2012, Barclays paid £290 million to settle an investigation of possible manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. At least 10 people in Britain and the United States face criminal charges related to Libor. In the last year, regulators in Britain, the United States, Germany, Switzerland and Hong Kong have opened investigations into the currency markets, and more than a dozen foreign exchange traders at large banks, including Barclays, UBS and JPMorgan Chase, have been put on leave over questions on whether they colluded to manipulate benchmark currency rates. The Barclays chief executive, Antony Jenkins, said last week that he would forgo a bonus for 2013 in light of the bank's restructuring and litigation costs. He will receive a base salary of £1.1 million. The bank is undergoing a major restructuring, including shedding more than 4,000 jobs.  "
Secret Global Strike Kills 2 Malicious Web Viruses,"WASHINGTON -- Federal agents over the weekend secretly seized control of two computer networks that hackers used to steal millions of dollars from unsuspecting victims. In doing so, the Justice Department disrupted the circulation of two of the world's most pernicious viruses and turned a 30-year-old Russian computer hacker into a most-wanted fugitive. The strike, coordinated with the European authorities, was aimed at malware called GameOver Zeus, which is known to steal bank information and send it to overseas hackers, and CryptoLocker, which burrows into computers and encrypts personal data. The hackers then demand a ransom to unlock the files.  ''By the time the victims learned that their computers had been infected, it was far too late,'' Leslie R. Caldwell, the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division, said Monday. Together, the Justice Department estimates, the two malicious programs have infected between 500,000 and a million computers and cost people more than $100 million in direct and indirect losses. Authorities had been investigating the two viruses separately, but along the way, they realized that GameOver Zeus was the main vehicle by which CryptoLocker was spread, the Justice Department said. They also determined that the operations were run by the same man, whom the Justice Department identified as Evgeniy M. Bogachev, of Anapa, Russia. Investigators were hunting for him even before they knew his name. Inside the F.B.I., he has long been one of the government's most sought-after individual cybercriminals, through his screen name, Lucky12345. While both pieces of software are distributed through spam emails, they accomplish different things, each highly damaging. Once inside a computer, GameOver Zeus quietly tracks each keystroke. When the software detects someone logging into a bank account, it records the password. Armed with that information, hackers log in and drain the account. Often they stole more than $1 million from businesses, prosecutors said, with at least one theft exceeding $6 million. CryptoLocker spreads through emails that look like they are from legitimate businesses, including fake tracking notices from FedEx and U.P.S. Once inside a network, such as a company's computer system, the virus can spread from one computer to the next. As it spreads, the software locks up computer files behind unbreakable encryption, then demands hundreds of dollars in exchange for the code that unlocks it. Investigators say many people and organizations, including the police department in Swansea, Mass., have paid to recover their files. Those who refused saw their files permanently erased. Such so-called ransomware is a growing security threat. Investigators have targeted large malicious software networks, known as botnets, before. In 2011, the F.B.I. hijacked a command-and-control server that ran the similarly harmful Coreflood network. It then sent a shutdown command to every infected computer, effectively killing the virus in one stroke. This weekend's takedown, which was months in the making, was far more difficult. While CryptoLocker used a command-and-control server, GameOver Zeus did not. Instead, it relied on a decentralized structure, and it did not have a simple shutdown command. In meetings late last year, F.B.I. agents and private security experts devised a plan to outsmart the hackers. The best chance the F.B.I. had to wrest control of the network, it was decided, was by seizing all the servers that transmitted the malicious code and rerouting their traffic to a safe, government-controlled computer. In theory, every time an infected computer asked for instructions to carry out its malicious mission, it would instead find itself harmlessly talking to the United States government. But the GameOver Zeus servers were spread across the world. If the agents missed one infected server, the hackers could use it to restart the network and continue spreading the code. ''You don't want to have any loose ends,'' said Shawn Henry, a former top F.B.I. cyber investigator and president of CrowdStrike Services, one of several security firms that worked with government on the case. ''You want it to be swift. You want it to be complete.'' Early last Friday, authorities in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Ukraine and the United Kingdom physically took over the servers that served as the backbone for GameOver Zeus and CryptoLocker, Ms. Caldwell said. All Internet traffic was then rerouted, under a court order, to the government's safe computer. All weekend, the agents waited and watched for signs of success. Investigators worked from command centers at F.B.I. headquarters in Washington, Europol headquarters at The Hague in the Netherlands and at the National Cyber-Forensics & Training Alliance in Pittsburgh. One by one, computers across the world contacted the government's safe computer, signifying that America, not the hackers, was in control of the network. With each electronic ping, the government collected the Internet addresses of the infected systems, providing a map of the worldwide infection. By Sunday, officials said they were confident they had dismantled the network and collected enough data to help security firms and technology companies clean infected computers. ''More than 300,000 victim computers were freed from the botnet,'' Ms. Caldwell said. ''We expect that number to increase as additional computers are powered on and connect to the Internet this week.'' CryptoLocker similarly came under United States control, Ms. Caldwell said. On Monday, the government unsealed court documents charging Mr. Bogachev with bank, computer and wire fraud. The F.B.I. placed Mr. Bogachev on its list of most-wanted cybercriminals. Mr. Bogachev remains free and the United States has asked Russian authorities to turn him over. Those discussions are continuing, the Justice Department said. "
Tech Start-Ups Are Targets of Ransom Cyberattacks," Scott Heiferman and Gary Burns had less than four minutes to decide whether to pay up or go down. One Thursday morning, an email popped into their inbox informing Mr. Heiferman, one of the founders, and Mr. Burns, the chief technology officer of Meetup, a New York Internet company that connects groups offline, that their site would go down unless they paid $300 worth of Bitcoins. Four minutes later, 40 times the company's typical data flow crashed Meetup's site, beginning a disruption that wouldn't be resolved until the next Monday.  Meetup is one of several small web start-ups that have been hit recently by a wave of so-called denial-of-service, or DDoS attacks, in which attackers knock a victim offline using a flood of traffic and refuse to stop until their victims pay their ransom in Bitcoins. The amounts demanded are typically low - which seems like a lot of work for little payoff - but those who have been targeted say they think the nominal amounts are bait and could lead to future extortion and demands. If their company is willing to pay $300, for example, they might also be willing to pay $3,000 or $30,000 down the road. Other start-ups that have been hit are Vimeo, the video-sharing company; Basecamp, a project management software company; Bit.ly, the link-shortening service;  Shutterstock, the stock photography agency; and MailChimp, the email marketing provider. The F.B.I.  is looking into the attacks, according to two people close to the inquiry who would speak only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about a continuing investigation. They said the agency was operating under the assumption that the attacks were the work of the same culprit, or group of culprits. Jennifer Shearer, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I., declined to comment. DDoS attacks in general are on the rise, according to Arbor Networks, a security firm in Burlington, Mass., after a ""hockey stick"" growth trajectory,  meaning flat growth followed by an extreme increase in growth, resembling an image of a hockey stick. Last year, the frequency of such attacks jumped eightfold from the previous year, and the size of the attacks eclipsed previous peaks by over 200 percent, according to a report by the firm. The result has been a boom in business for companies that specialize in protecting against DDoS attacks. These include Cloudflare, a four-year-old company based in San Francisco that spreads its clientele's traffic across its many data centers and so can quickly recognize and filter out a DDoS attack before it hits a company's network. It offers basic services free but charges for additional security, like reducing the severity of DDoS attacks. Most customers pay $20 a month, but large businesses can pay as much as $2,000 a month. Other companies offering services like this include Akamai, based in Cambridge, Mass., which bought Prolexic, a DDoS mitigation service based in Hollywood, Fla., for $370 million in December, and Arbor Networks. Executives at these companies admit that the wave of attacks has worked to their favor. For example, Matthew Prince, Cloudflare's chief executive, said his company had increased revenue 450 percent last year, partly because of  awareness of DDoS attacks. Small tech start-ups have become a particular target of these attacks because they ""have things of value that a DDoS attack can hurt,"" said Andy Ellis, chief security officer at Akamai. ""It's the modern equivalent of someone walking into a shop and saying 'That's a nice business you've got here - shame if anything happened to it.'"" Victims essentially have two choices: Pay the ransom and pray the attackers don't come back for more, or pay for a DDoS mitigation service. Companies also can sign up for website hosting services with giants like Amazon and Google that can accommodate larger flows of attack traffic. Mr. Ellis of Akamai said it often did not make sense for companies to spend the money to build out a data infrastructure just to accommodate one large attack when they delt  with only a fraction of that traffic on a daily basis. ""It's not a wise trade-off,"" Mr. Ellis said. ""But it's economics I like as a vendor in this space. I'll be very honest about it."" Security experts say a surprising percentage of victims pay the ransom to make the problem go away. Meetup's executives said they decided early on that paying was not an option. ""There's the moral hazard of engaging,"" Brendan McGovern, Meetup's chief financial officer, said. ""Because if you were to pay, you can't take them at their word that they will halt, or worse, you'll get your name on a list in the criminal hacker world saying that you are a company that's willing to pay."" Ultimately, Meetup signed up with Cloudflare and was able to ward off the attacks without paying a ransom. But it clearly took a toll. Mr. McGovern compared the attacks at Meetup to a scene in the ""The Walking Dead."" ""Imagine you run a coffee shop,"" he told employees. ""And zombies start coming in - millions of zombies - and you can't sell coffee."" Even after the attack was mitigated, the attacker continued to send increasingly whiny emails. Other than that, the only remnant of the attack was a sticker on Mr. Heiferman's laptop featuring Dr. Evil, the villain from Austin Powers, and $300 in big bubble letters. Another employee had made it and given it to him to lighten the mood.  "
"For Google, A Toehold Into Goods For a Home","SAN FRANCISCO -- Google, which dominates much of life on the Internet, has been trying to expand beyond computers and telephones to living rooms, cars and bodies. It made its way a bit further into people's homes on Monday when it agreed to pay $3.2 billion in cash for Nest Labs, which makes Internet-connected devices like thermostats and smoke alarms. Nest, which was started in 2010 by Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, members of the teams that built the iPhone and iPod at Apple, will continue to operate independently under its own brand and expand its portfolio of connected versions of what it calls ''unloved but important devices in the home.'' Mr. Fadell, Nest's chief executive, will report to Larry Page, co-founder and chief executive of Google.  Internet companies are vying to be the gateway through which people live every aspect of their lives -- whether searching, socializing, reading, shopping, exercising or sleeping. Their businesses, particularly advertising, are built on watching the way people behave online. For Google, gaining visibility into people's habits beyond computers and phones -- whether watching television using Chromecast, taking a walk wearing Google Glass or managing their homes using Nest products -- will provide a fuller picture of users. ''Google likes to know everything they can about us, so I suppose devices that are monitoring what's going on in our homes is another excellent way for them to gather that information,'' said Danny Sullivan, a longtime Google analyst and a founding editor of Search Engine Land. ''The more they're tied into our everyday life, the more they feel they can deliver products we'll like and ads.'' Nest's products track not just a home's temperature and the presence of smoke but also when people wake up, leave and return home. By incorporating hardware and software and using sensors and algorithms to learn behavior, they program themselves and can be controlled remotely with a smartphone. Mr. Fadell said in an interview that he was aware of concerns among customers about Google having so much data about people, and that Google agreed that Nest's privacy policy -- which says that Nest will use customer information only to improve its products and services -- would remain unchanged. ''That was a major concern or question we had, and they have done an amazing job of convincing us that our privacy policies are going to be well-respected in their organization,'' he said. Still, Mr. Sullivan said, ''History has shown that privacy policies do change.'' He added, ''They won't hand over Nest data to Google, and Google mines it for whatever they want, but there could be incentives or reasons why it might make sense to tie it to a Google account.'' It is easy to see how Google products could be integrated into Nest. For instance, Nest users who log in to Google could theoretically someday see their home's temperature or an alert about the presence of smoke in Google Now or in gmail, and information about a person's home life could be used to target ads. Google and Nest declined to comment on future plans because the deal has not yet closed. Creating the so-called connected home through products like Nest's is a major goal for the technology industry, even if it has not yet made its way into the mainstream. Apple, Philips, Bose, Dropcam and Lively, among others, make Internet-connected devices to dim lights, close garage doors, listen to music or keep an eye on family members or pets with sensors or live video. Still, just 1 or 2 percent of people have common connected devices, and while a third say they are interested in connecting their homes, almost half say they are not, according to Forrester, a technology research firm. ''I think we're at the beginning of the industry hype cycle but not at the beginning of mainstream consumer adoption,'' said Frank E. Gillett, a Forrester analyst. Nest, which had raised $180 million from investors, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Shasta Ventures and Google Ventures, was seeking late last year to raise an additional round of financing at a valuation over $2 billion, according to two people briefed on the fund-raising. Unlike many of Silicon Valley's most popular companies that make software that costs very little to build, Nest is capital-intensive because it builds hardware. Though it was not looking to be acquired, these people said, Google approached the company with an acquisition offer and the resources to expand more quickly than it could on its own. ''What this is really about is accelerating a decade-old vision,'' Mr. Fadell said. Despite the Nest founders' long history and shared values with Apple, a main Google rival, it was not a serious contender to acquire the company, the people said. ''This is not an us versus them kind of thing,'' Mr. Fadell said. Google has talked about connecting home devices, known as the Internet of Things, for several years, but has made little traction. Still it has been expanding beyond its search engine roots into hardware, including through its $13 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility and its development of devices like Google Glass, the Internet-connected eyewear, and Chromecast, for Internet-connected television. It also recently acquired companies that make robots and gesture-recognition technology. Mr. Page, since returning as chief executive in 2011, has also made priorities of design and products with daily utility, both of which are priorities of Nest. Though Google once differentiated itself from Apple by giving software to hardware developers, like Android for mobile phones, instead of making the hardware itself, the Nest acquisition is part of a shift away from that strategy. ''The way you're going to change the home is not just through software and services, you're going to have to change the fundamental products people interact with, and they understand that,'' Mr. Fadell said. ''They're moving the entire company that way.'' "
"Newly Wary, Shoppers Trust Cash","Like dieters vowing to trade cupcakes for carrots, a number of American shoppers are making a new pledge: cash only. The drumbeat of disclosures about credit and debit card breaches at major retailers (and hints of more to come) has unnerved consumers to the point where chatter online and at the water cooler is filled with people promising to curb their plastic habits. ''This is CRAZY. First my Target card, now this,'' wrote Lorraine McCullough on the Michaels Stores Facebook page last week after the arts and crafts chain said that it was investigating whether customer data had been exposed. ''I am going to pay cash from now on.'' Similar sentiments poured in.  ''Cash! Simple as that.'' ''I am carrying cash for now on as well. The good old-fashioned way.'' ''Yup, cash is the best way quite honestly.'' With Senate hearings on the recent Target breach and the security of consumer data scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, discussion about what consumers can do on their own is likely to grow even louder. A poll released last week by The Associated Press and GfK Public Affairs & Corporate Communications found that 37 percent of Americans had made an effort to use cash instead of credit or debit cards to pay for purchases as a result of the recent data thefts -- almost as many as those who checked personal credit reports because of the thefts. (Just 29 percent said they had changed passwords or requested new cards.) Even trying to use cash more often is a strange adjustment for a population that has become accustomed to the convenience of pulling out a little piece of plastic (the better to rack up rewards points) for purchases as small as a Diet Coke. Many people now swipe their cards with so little thought that they don't even bother getting the receipt. Whereas cards were once reserved for big purchases, they have become acceptable for almost anything, including at formerly all-cash businesses like New York City taxis. More than a quarter of street food vendors now accept plastic, according to a recent study of food trucks and carts by Mobile Cuisine magazine, and 14 percent more say they will soon start. With a variety of new forms of mobile payments -- a television commercial for Chase's QuickPay service shows how you can pay the teenage babysitter without cash -- paper money has almost become an antiquated concept for some people, like a purse of gold coins. Nicole McNamee of Germantown, Tenn., used a card for almost everything, even the $1 cups of coffee she routinely bought at the local McDonald's drive-through. Then, last month, she and her husband learned of fraudulent charges -- some $1,200 worth of purchases in Minnesota and California, including $400 at a Toys ''R'' Us on Christmas Eve -- on her personal American Express card and a card he uses for his business. Startled, they decided to follow the lead of some friends and take the pledge: cash only, whenever possible. ''We said, 'Let's just give ourselves a dollar value and pay cash for everything,' '' Ms. McNamee said. So far, they have found that the shift has had benefits beyond making them feel more secure. Since they can only spend what they have in their wallets, Ms. McNamee noted, ''It has indirectly helped us keep on a better budget and save more.'' She starts the week with $100 and, when the money in her wallet is low, has found herself forgoing purchases she wouldn't have hesitated to buy with a card. She has even come to value the spare pennies, nickels and dimes that she once tossed into random receptacles at home. Now she uses it for that McDonald's coffee. Still, despite the talk, no hard data exists to indicate whether significantly more consumers actually are using cash. ''We aren't releasing that data,'' said a Visa spokeswoman in response to a query about whether the company had noticed a recent dip in card use. A MasterCard spokesman declined to comment. An American Express spokeswoman said, ''In general, card usage at merchants is in line with seasonal trends we've seen in prior years in December and January.'' While a number of shoppers have said they are using cash at Target specifically, Target itself would not say whether this is true. ''Unfortunately, I don't have any details on payment types to provide,'' a spokeswoman wrote in an email. Financial advisers and consumer advocates say there are drawbacks to an all-cash existence beyond the nuisance and expense of running to the A.T.M. (A study this year by Tufts University, called ''The Cost of Cash in the United States,'' found that the average American spends 28 minutes each month, or 5.6 hours a year, traveling to banks or A.T.M.'s to get cash. It found that the average fee to use a non-network A.T.M. is now about $3.85 per transaction.) For one thing, cash is not an option with online purchases. And vowing to use cash is a knee-jerk response that doesn't necessarily make sense, some say. Adam Levin, chairman and co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911, which provides data protection and management services to businesses, said he told himself to use cash when he went to a Target shortly after Christmas. But the truth is, he said, ''That is not realistic.'' ''Cash has its own drawbacks in terms of possibly being mugged and of keeping track of your expenditures,'' said Susan Grant, director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America, an association of consumer organizations around the country. There is also the danger of losing it; Ms. McNamee noted that she has found loose bills in the laundry. Besides, said Ms. Grant, ''You don't want to be carrying a bag of money into Best Buy to buy a flat-screen TV. People shouldn't have to resort to that for peace of mind.'' Mr. Levin noted that it was important for people to build up a credit history. Still, he said: ''People are right to be terrified about what's going on with these breaches. I think we have to face facts, that breach unfortunately is the new normal. It's the new black. It's just where we're going. We have to focus on monitoring and damage control.'' Rather than resorting to paying cash, it is more important for people to monitor their bank and card statements every day, he said, and to make sure never to use a debit card for an online purchase. ''You've got to live your life,'' he said, ''but you've got to add one additional layer of vigilance.'' Already, some of the cash vows are proving to be about as temporary as those no-cupcake pledges. Kenyetta Kelley of Dothan, Ala., had her debit card information stolen after she used the card on Black Friday at Target. (She learned this when she tried to use it at another store soon after and it was declined.) ''I told myself I'm just going to start using cash more,'' she said. That worked well for a week or so. But then a new debit card arrived in the mail. ''When I got the new card, I just felt safe again,'' she said. And now she's back to using it routinely. ''It's just more convenient,'' she said. ''I try to keep cash on me but it's just always gone.'' "
Dogged by Data Theft,"''What is stopping us from moving to this kind of technology?'' asked a perplexed Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota. It was last Tuesday, and the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which Klobuchar sits, was holding a hearing about the recent breaches of Target and Neiman Marcus in which the data from tens of millions of credit and debit cards were stolen. The technology Klobuchar had in mind is known as chip-and-PIN. The chip refers to a computer chip embedded in a credit or debit card that encrypts data and authenticates the card. The PIN refers to a personal identification number the customer has to use, which, in effect, authenticates the user.  It is no big secret that, from a security standpoint, a chip-and-PIN system is far superior to the magnetic stripe that is the backbone of the credit and debit card systems in the United States. Criminal gangs in Eastern Europe have learned how to penetrate many computer systems of American retailers and ''skim'' credit card data at the moment a transaction takes place. That kind of theft would be virtually impossible with a chip-and-PIN system. Nor is it news that much of the rest of the world long ago adopted chip-and-PIN technology; according to MasterCard, 79 percent of terminals in Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean are ''chip-enabled,'' a figure that rises to 95 percent in parts of Europe. But, inexplicably, this clearly superior technology has not yet penetrated the United States. Or maybe it's not so inexplicable. The main stumbling block, it would appear, is that retailers and bankers have spent way too much time blaming each other for the growing data theft problem -- and not nearly enough time worrying about the people whose data have been stolen. Namely, us. ''Why did the U.S. stick with the mag stripe?'' said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report. It may not have been best for consumers, but it was ''cheap and efficient'' for the banks and retailers. What's more, banks and retailers had a certain amount of fraud built into their business models. Thus, while a hacked card brought big headaches to the customer, it was just another cost of doing business for the other entities involved in the transaction. Even as Europe and Canada were moving to a chip-and-PIN system, the American banks held back. Fraud at the point of sale dropped dramatically in countries with chip-and-PIN. Still the U.S. held back. Every time there was a push to adopt chip-and-PIN, both retailers and bankers would do the math and come to the same conclusion: It wasn't worth the trouble. And when a company did try to adopt it? That's what Target tried to do around 2003 -- only to discover that it was largely a waste of money if nobody else went along. In Europe and elsewhere governments had pushed companies to adopt chip-and-PIN. In the U.S., the banks and retailers needed to be able to work together -- spending billions both to manufacture new cards and install new terminals that could read the cards. There are two things that are likely to change the equation. The first is the Target breach, which, one expert told me, could involve as many as one in every 10 cards in circulation in the United States. Many of the cards are debit cards, which means if the card is used by a crook to make a purchase, it comes directly out of the customer's bank account. (Target has vowed to indemnify any customer who has losses as a result of the breach.) The Target breach has shown the reputational hit a company can take when its system is breached. It also has had business consequences: the last two weeks of the Christmas season were lousy ones for Target -- and the publicity from the breach is considered a prime culprit. Second, though, Visa and MasterCard have both set forth timetables that attempt to institute the adoption of embedded-chips technology by the fall of 2015. Although the timetables are not mandatory, they would essentially shift the liability for card losses on to whichever side -- the bank or the retailer -- has the least secure technology. Although there were various calls for delaying the implementation yet again, those calls stopped once the Target breach took place. Which is not to say that the banks and the retailers are now seeing eye to eye. When I spoke to a bank lobbyist last week, he told me that the real problem was ''a weakness in the internal computer system of large companies that sophisticated criminals have learned to exploit.'' The retailers, meanwhile, retort that the banks have continually come up with ideas short of chip-and-PIN, none of which ever worked for long before the bad guys figured how to breach them. The only thing missing from these arguments is the consumer. "
Energy Panel Faulted on Information Safeguards,"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may not have adequate controls to protect information that could be used to sabotage the power grid, the Energy Department's inspector general said on Wednesday. The inspector general, Gregory H. Friedman, issued a ''management alert'' that was a veiled slap at a former chairman of the commission, Jon Wellinghoff, who has been arguing that an attack last year on a California substation was an act of terrorism, a conclusion that the F.B.I. and local law enforcement officials have refused to endorse. Mr. Friedman said that the commission staff had created a presentation that ''should have been classified and protected from release.'' The commission generated a memo, later described by The Wall Street Journal, that said that simultaneous attacks on a handful of substations around the country could cripple the power grid. The inspector general said he was acting after a complaint from the Energy Department's ethics officer and letters from the chairwoman and ranking minority member of the Senate Energy Committee. He recommended establishing a classification system, a step he said the current chairwoman of the commission had promised to implement promptly.  "
Advisory Group Opposes Re-election of Most of Target's Board,"An influential shareholder advisory group said that most of Target's board did not deserve to be re-elected, directly linking what it said was a lack of adequate oversight by the board to the extensive breach of customer data late last year. The move was unusual for the advisory group, Institutional Shareholder Services, which said that seven of Target's 10 board members deserved to be voted against. An I.S.S. spokesman said that so far this year, the firm has recommended shareholders vote against the majority of board members only 11 times -- out of 421 companies it has assessed in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.  I.S.S. also said Target should separate the roles of chairman and chief executive. In outlining its reasons this week for seeking to overturn much of the board's composition, I.S.S. said that members of the board's audit committee and corporate responsibility committees had failed to provide adequate risk oversight, and that changes the committees made since the breach were ''largely reactionary in nature.'' ''The data breach revealed that the company was inadequately prepared for the significant risks of doing business in today's electronic commerce environment,'' the I.S.S. report said. ''It appears that failure of the committees to ensure appropriate management of these risks set the stage for the data breach, which has resulted in significant losses to the company and its shareholders.'' On Wednesday, Target called risk oversight ''a full board responsibility,'' rather than the purview of just a few members. It also defended its data security standards before its system was breached -- despite the fact that many experts have said the company failed to put in place certain important security measures, and even ignored the warnings of its own security system during the breach. ''With respect to information security matters, the board believes that Target was among the best-in-class within the retail industry,'' the company said in a statement. ''As one would expect, following the criminal attack that resulted in the data breach, the board is re-examining the entire risk oversight structure, including senior management roles and reporting structures, as well as board oversight.'' But I.S.S. also criticized many of the very moves Target has made since the breach in an effort to right itself, including its current search for a chief information security officer and a chief compliance officer. ''For shareholders who have seen the value of their investment decline by over 10 percent, this might appear to be a case of 'too little too late,' '' I.S.S. said. Since news of the breach became public in December, Target has been knocked off kilter. Three of the retailer's highest-ranking executives, including Gregg Steinhafel, the chief executive, have resigned or been fired. The company's earnings have taken a substantial hit. All the while, Target has struggled with a disastrous introduction in Canada, its first foray outside the United States. Target's stock has fallen more than 12 percent in the last six months. The board members whom I.S.S. recommended voting against were Roxanne S. Austin, Anne M. Mulcahy, Mary E. Minnick, Calvin Darden, Henrique De Castro, Derica W. Rice and James A. Johnson. The voting will take place during Target's annual shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for June 11. "
Target Hires a New Data Watchdog,"Target named a seasoned security expert as its new chief information security officer on Tuesday, on the eve of its annual shareholders' meeting, as the retailer sought to bolster its data defenses and calm investor chagrin after the extensive hacking it experienced last year.  Brad Maiorino, formerly in charge of global information security at General Motors, will join Target on Monday to strengthen its protection against security threats, the company said in a statement. Mr. Maiorino, who had also served as chief information security officer at General Electric, will report to Bob DeRodes, who was recently hired as Target's executive vice president and chief information officer, the statement said. Target, one of the nation's largest retailers, has promised to overhaul its information security systems after data on tens of millions of Target customers was compromised last year in a large-scale security breach. Target has ramped up its hiring of information security employees, requires annual data security training for all employees and runs a 24-hour security operations center to watch for suspicious activity, the company said in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week. Target has also sped up the introduction of a more secure payment-card technology for its branded cards. Still, an influential advisory group, Institutional Shareholder Services, is urging investors set to gather in Dallas on Wednesday to vote against the majority of Target's directors, saying they failed to sufficiently oversee risk before the breach. Information security experts say that the company did not have some important safeguards in place. Target has said that its traffic and sales took substantive hits after news of the breach became public. In May, the retailer lowered its profit outlook for the full year, after reporting a 16 percent fall in net profit to $418 million in the first quarter. Mr. Maiorino has the experience to spearhead Target's heightened defenses, the retailer said. On top of handling information security at G.M. and at G.E., Mr. Maiorino has also worked in information technology at IBM, at Datalan and at Deloitte & Touche and has a computer studies degree from Pace University, according to his LinkedIn profile. "
Target Seeks to Reassure Its Investors at Meeting,"DALLAS -- At Target's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, the questions were few and the attendance sparse, in stark contrast to the company's exceptionally tumultuous year.  Fewer than 100 people assembled in a conference room here, near tables of Target's house brand string cheese and granola bars, as Roxanne S. Austin, the interim board chairwoman and John J. Mulligan, the interim chief executive, acknowledged that it had been a difficult year. Over the last year, the company had an enormous breach of customer data and oversaw a disastrous opening of more than 100 new stores in Canada. Its chief executive, Gregg Steinhafel, also resigned. All of these were mentioned, if sometimes obliquely, by executives on Wednesday. At the shareholder meeting -- and over the last several weeks -- Target executives have sought to portray a sense of action at Target rather than a company treading water until a new chief executive is found. On Tuesday, the company announced that it had hired a new chief information security officer. And on Monday, Mr. Mulligan sent an email to all Target staff describing some structural changes aimed at streamlining decision-making at the company. Recently, a shareholder advisory group said most of the company's board did not deserve to be re-elected, asserting that the data breach indicated that it had provided insufficient risk oversight. But according to preliminary voting announced at the meeting on Wednesday, all the board members were elected. The meeting lasted about 40 minutes. When it was over, Aaron M. Epstein, who said he had been a shareholder since 1967, approached Kathryn A. Tesija, Target's chief merchandising officer -- who has been mentioned as a possible successor to Mr. Steinhafel -- and gave her a jar of homemade orange marmalade. "
Sequoia and Greylock Lead $40 Million Round for Skyhigh Networks,"Skyhigh Networks, which makes security software for cloud computing, has raised an additional $40 million from investors, including Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital. Salesforce, one of the biggest cloud computing companies in Silicon Valley, also participated in the round.  The latest series C round brings the company's total funding to $66.5 million. The money will be used to increase its existing offerings, hire more employees and develop new products. Skyhigh did not reveal its valuation, but its chief executive, Rajiv Gupta, said it was less than $1 billion. Like many other start-ups taking big rounds of money from venture capital funds, Skyhigh says it does not need the money. It still has cash in the bank from its $20 million series B round last year. Nor is Skyhigh profitable. ""Profitability is not my goal,"" Mr. Gupta said. ""I could be profitable today, but the idea is to create a game changing company."" Skyhigh makes software for companies that allows them to monitor employees' use of cloud computing services. After starting just two years ago, Skyhigh already has 200 customers, including DirecTV, Cisco and BMC Software. ""The reason I'm bullish on Skyhigh is that there's a secular move to the cloud,"" said Asheem Chandna, a partner at Greylock Partners and a Skyhigh board member. ""Employees and companies are increasingly using cloud services."" "
Facebook's Secret Manipulation of User Emotions Under British Inquiry,"A British regulator has begun an inquiry into Facebook's disclosure last week that it deliberately manipulated the emotional content of posts in the news feeds of nearly 700,000 users to see if emotions were contagious.  The company did not seek explicit permission from the affected people - roughly one out of every 2,500 users of the social network at the time of the experiment - and some critics have suggested that the research violated its terms of service with its customers. Facebook has said that customers gave blanket permission for research as a condition of using the service. Britain's Information Commissioner's Office told the Financial Times that it was examining whether Facebook broke data protection laws when it conducted the weeklong experiment in January 2012. The British regulators also plan to ask counterparts in Ireland, where Facebook's European operations are based, to investigate. In a statement, Richard Allan, Facebook's director of policy in Europe, said, ""It's clear that people were upset by this study and we take responsibility for it. We want to do better in the future and are improving our process based on this feedback. The study was done with appropriate protections for people's information and we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have."" The Federal Trade Commission, the American regulator that oversees Facebook's conduct under a 20-year consent decree, has not publicly expressed similar interest in the case, which has caused an uproar over the company's ethics and prompted the lead researcher on the project to apologize.

Nominee for European Digital Job Explains Positions in Hearing,"LONDON - Telecommunications investment. Data protection reforms. Cellphone roaming charges. Günther Oettinger, the nominee to be the European Union's next digital economy commissioner, would have a lot on his plate. The tasks that would await him were outlined in a three-hour hearing Monday when members of the European Parliament peppered Mr. Oettinger, a 61-year-old German politician, with questions about how he would manage the diverse challenges that he would inherit by taking up the position on Nov. 1. Throughout the lengthy question-and-answer session, Mr. Oettinger emphasized that he wanted to create greater connections across the 28-member bloc, and that more investment was needed by local companies if Europe was to keep pace with other regions like the United States and Asia.  ""We have to compete in the Champions League, and we don't do that at the moment,"" said Mr. Oettinger, the current European energy commissioner, in reference to the Pan-European soccer tournament that includes the likes of Real Madrid, [#x200b]Chelsea and Bayern Munich. ""We need at least two or three global companies in every sector if we want to compete in the global market."" Mr. Oettinger's comments came as the other nominees for the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, also faced questions as part of a weeklong set of hearings held by the European Parliament. In wide-ranging responses to questions that included some about European telecommunications consolidation and surveillance by the National Security Agency, Mr. Oettinger tried to balance industry demands for less regulation to promote investment with the politicians' fears that individuals' online data might be misused by local and international companies like Google. Mr. Oettinger backed long-awaited plans to create a single European market for electronic communications - called the ""Connected Continent"" proposals. Those plans include allowing potentially increased consolidation among Europe's current disparate telecommunications market, in which many local carriers have struggled to invest in high-speed mobile connections. ""Europe has many assets when it comes to the digital economy, but we are lagging behind compared to the U.S.,"" Mr. Oettinger told European politicians on Monday, adding that the new legislation should be completed by early next year. ""The main investments must come from the private sector."" In a nod to European concerns over data protection, the prospective European commissioner gave his support to stiffer rules currently under consideration that would provide Europeans with a greater say over how their online data is used by the likes of Google, Facebook and other Internet giants. Many European politicians have voiced concerns that the current standards allow local data to be potentially misused by international companies, though Mr. Oettinger stressed that there were limits to how much information should be shared with non-European jurisdictions. ""Consumers should know if their data is shared, and where it has been passed on to,"" he said. Mr. Oettinger backed limits on how much Europeans must pay to use their cellphones when traveling in Europe. He also supported the principle known as the ""right to be forgotten,"" in which people have the right to ask that links to information about themselves be removed from Internet searches. In May, Europe's highest court said that search engines, including Google and Microsoft's Bing, have to provide this service to European customers, and potentially to people further afield. But while Mr. Oettinger supported the principle, he said there were limits if the information was deemed to be in the public interest. ""It's one of the things you simply have to live with,"" he said. Another major challenge awaiting Mr. Oettinger is [#x200b]legislation around so-called net neutrality.[#x200b] This year, the European Parliament voted to guarantee equal access to the Internet for anyone looking to stream online content. Local telecommunications companies have argued that they should be able to charge extra for enhanced speed and access to their networks. When asked where he stood on the issue, Mr. Oettinger said he supported both easy access to Internet services and the right of companies to profit from their investments. This tightrope walk during the three-hour hearing highlighted the difficulties the prospective European commissioner would be likely to face in trying to foster investment in the Continent's economy, while also protecting people's online privacy. ""We have to do everything we can so no one is disadvantaged on the Net,"" Mr. Oettinger said. He then added: ""I don't want to burden the digital economy with too much red tape.""                       "
"Days After a Federal Seizure, Another Type of Ransomware Gains Ground","SAN FRANCISCO - It has been mere days since federal agents seized control of computer networks used by hackers to infect victims with CryptoLocker, a piece of malware known as ""ransomware,"" which encrypts the contents of computing devices so hackers can demand a ransom to decrypt it.   Now security researchers are seeing an influx of  another form of ransomware, called Cryptowall. In April, criminals began advertising RIG, a so-called exploit kit, which  automates the exploitation of software vulnerabilities. For $60 a day or $300 a week, criminals could use it to infect victims' machines with 8 to 12 percent success rates, according to advertisements. Almost immediately, security researchers began noticing the kits being used across the Internet, in many cases to distribute Cryptowall. Security researchers at Cisco said the exploit kit has been gaining steam this month. Since Cisco began blocking the attacks on April 24, its researchers said they had blocked requests to over 90 infected web domains for more than 17 percent of its cloud-security customer base. In many cases, criminals were infecting victims by distributing malicious advertising - known as ""malvertising"" - on legitimate, popular websites, then using the exploit kit to burrow into customers' machines and encrypt their contents with Cryptowall. In several cases, victims would find a message informing them that their data had been encrypted by criminals and would remain unreadable until they paid a $200 fee.  ""If you really value your data, then we suggest you do not waste valuable time searching for other solutions because they do not exist,"" was one message. When victims do not pay the specified ransom by the deadline, they may receive a second message - as Cisco's researchers did - tripling the ransom demand to $600. The largest share of infections, some 42 percent, are in the United States, followed by England and Australia, according to Cisco. Ransomware dates to 2009 in Eastern Europe. Earlier this week, the Justice Department estimated that criminals had infected as many as one million computers and cost people more than $100 million in direct and indirect losses. Cisco researchers said the best defense was to be cautious about clicking on malicious sites, back up the contents of your devices and regularly run software updates to ward off attacks like RIG. "
Home Depot Confirms That It Was Hacked,"Home Depot confirmed Monday that hackers broke into its store payments systems, in what could be the largest known breach of a retail company's computer network. The retailer said the exact number of customers affected was still not clear. But a person briefed on the investigation said the total number of credit cards stolen at Home Depot could top 60 million. By comparison, the breach last year at Target, the largest known attack to date, affected 40 million cardholders.  The Home Depot intrusion may have affected any customer at Home Depot stores in the United States and Canada from April to early last week, said Paula Drake, a company spokeswoman. Customers at Home Depot's Mexico stores were not affected, nor were online shoppers at HomeDepot.com. Debit card personal identification numbers were not taken, she said. Home Depot has not yet confirmed details of the breach, Ms. Drake said.  But security experts anticipate the Home Depot episode could eclipse the retail hack at Target last year. Home Depot operates 1,977 stores in the United States and 180 in Canada. That is about 400 more than Target operated when it was compromised. Target's breach went on for three weeks before the company learned about it, while the attack at Home Depot went unnoticed for as many as five months.  Home Depot said it would offer free identity protection and credit monitoring services to any customer who had used a credit or debit card at any of its affected stores. ""Honestly, Home Depot is in trouble here,"" said Eric Cowperthwaite, vice president of Core Security, an Internet security consulting company. Mr. Cowperthwaite noted that it was a blogger, Brian Krebs, not the company, that first reported the breach. ""This is not how you handle a significant security breach, nor will it provide any sort of confidence that Home Depot can solve the problem going forward,"" he said. Last week, before Home Depot had confirmed the hack, customers in Georgia had already filed a class-action lawsuit against the retailer for failing to protect customers from fraud and failing to alert them to the breach in a timely manner.  Since the breach at Home Depot first came to executives' attention last Tuesday, the company said it had been working with two security firms, Symantec and FishNet Security, to investigate. Home Depot is unlikely to be the last big retailer to suffer a network breach. Hackers have for some time been scanning merchant networks for remote access capabilities, like outside contractors with access to a computer network. Once they find that opening, they install so-called malware software that is undetectable by antivirus products.  The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service recently estimated that more than 1,000 businessesin the United States had been infected with the malware, which is programmed to siphon payment card details from in-store cash registers. They believed that many of these businesses did not even know they were leaking customers' credit card information. Among the companies that have been hacked are UPS, Goodwill, P.F. Chang's, Sally's Beauty, Michael's, Neiman Marcus, and now Home Depot. Security experts believe the same group of criminals in Eastern Europe is behind the attacks, according to several people briefed on the results of forensics investigations who were not allowed to speak publicly because of nondisclosure agreements. In each case, the entry point has differed, according to one law enforcement official. At Target, it was thought to be a Pennsylvania company that provided heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration services to the retailer. The entry points for the other businesses are still unknown. Studies have found that retailers, in particular, are unprepared for such attacks. A joint study by the Ponemon Institute, an independent security research firm, and DB Networks, a database security firm, found that a majority of computer security experts in the United States believed that their organizations lacked the technology and tools to quickly detect database attacks.  Only one-third of those experts said they did the kind of continuous database monitoring needed to identify irregular activity in their databases, and 22 percent acknowledged that they did not scan at all.

A Spy's Deceptive Complaints,"Robert Hannigan, the new director of Britain's electronic intelligence agency, threw down quite a gauntlet with an op-ed article in The Financial Times arguing that the ever more secure communications services provided by the American technology companies that dominate the web have become the ''command-and-control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals.'' He is not the first spy to complain that post-Snowden concerns over privacy, including increased encryption on the web, have put serious constraints on fighting terrorism, though his phrasing is the toughest yet.  Mr. Hannigan primarily makes two points. One, quite familiar, is that the Islamic State has been spectacularly successful in using the web to promote itself, intimidate enemies and radicalize recruits. The other is that tougher privacy controls have enabled the terrorists to conceal their operations, while impeding ''lawful investigation by security and law enforcement agencies.'' But the crocodile tears of the intelligence chiefs overlook the fact that before those barriers were put in place, the United States National Security Agency and Mr. Hannigan's GCHQ misused their powers for an illegal dragnet surveillance operation. The technology companies are doing their job in protecting people's private data precisely because the intelligence agencies saw fit to rummage through that data. Mr. Hannigan's argument overlooks the many legal avenues intelligence agencies have to seek data. Demanding that the technology companies leave ''back doors'' open to their software or hardware also potentially assists Chinese, Russian and other hackers in accessing reams of data. Still, there is a terrorist threat; it is dispersed around the world and it does have a global tool on the web and in social networks. At the same time, there are powerful reasons for technology companies to protect the economic interests, personal privacy and civil liberties of their clients. The ways to solve potential conflicts include requiring court orders for data mining, restrictions on specific practices such as exploiting the back doors, and far stronger oversight of the intelligence community. They do not include blaming technology companies for doing their job. "
"Hal Finney, Cryptographer And Bitcoin Pioneer, 58","Hal Finney, a cryptographer and one of the earliest users and developers of the virtual currency Bitcoin, died on Thursday in Phoenix. He was 58. Mr. Finney had been paralyzed by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., and was taken off life support at Paradise Valley Hospital, his wife, Fran Finney, said. She said his body was immediately prepared for cryonic preservation by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Ariz., according to his wishes. A graduate of the California Institute of Technology, Mr. Finney was a longtime futurist who put his programming skills to work in the service of his ideals, particularly his desire to see the privacy of individuals protected.  In 1991, he began doing volunteer work for a new software project known as Pretty Good Privacy, or P.G.P., and immediately became one of the central players in developing the program. P.G.P. aimed to make it possible for people everywhere to encrypt electronic communication in a way that could not be read by anyone other than the intended recipient. The program used relatively new innovations in encryption that are still thought to be invulnerable to code breakers. Mr. Finney wrote in 1992 that cryptographic technology appealed to him because he worried about the ability of corporations and governments to snoop on citizens. ''The work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete,'' he wrote to an online group of fellow privacy activists. The original author of P.G.P., Philip R. Zimmermann, quickly became the target of federal prosecutors, who believed that the software broke United States laws against exporting military-grade encryption software. While the investigation went on and became a major cause for civil libertarians, Mr. Finney played a more quiet role in P.G.P. to avoid becoming a target himself. Mr. Zimmermann said in an interview that this decision meant Mr. Finney did not get proper credit for some of the important innovations he had made in the development of P.G.P. When the investigation concluded in 1996 without any charges being filed, P.G.P. became a company, and Mr. Zimmermann set out to hire Mr. Finney as his first employee. Mr. Zimmermann, in an interview before Mr. Finney died, said Mr. Finney was unusual in the field because he had none of the asocial tendencies and physical awkwardness that are commonly associated with people in the programming world. Rather, he said, Mr. Finney was a gregarious man who loved skiing and long-distance running. ''Sometimes people pay some price for being extremely smart -- they are deficient in some emotional quality,'' Mr. Zimmermann said. ''Hal was not like that.'' While working on P.G.P., Mr. Finney was a regular participant in a number of futurist mailing lists, the most famous of which gave birth to the Cypherpunk movement, dedicated to privacy-enhancing cryptography. Following these lists, Mr. Finney became fascinated by the concept of digital currencies that could not be tracked by governments and banks. He was involved in many experiments aimed at creating an anonymous form of digital money, including his own invention, in 2004, of reusable proofs of work. Though that system never took off, he quickly saw the promise of the Bitcoin project when it was announced on an obscure email list in 2008 by a creator with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin used some of the same cryptographic tools harnessed by P.G.P. and held out the promise that participants could choose to be anonymous when spending money online. When the project drew criticism from other cryptographers, Mr. Finney was among the first people to defend it. He downloaded the Bitcoin software the day it was released. The day after that, he took part in the first transaction on the network when Satoshi Nakamoto sent him 10 Bitcoins. His early work on Bitcoin and his programming background led to frequent speculation in the Bitcoin community that Mr. Finney was Satoshi Nakamoto, a claim he always denied. Soon after getting started with Bitcoin, Mr. Finney learned in 2009 that he had A.L.S., and he withdrew, for a time, from active participation in the project. Harold Thomas Finney II was born on May 4, 1956, in Coalinga, Calif., to Virginia and Harold Thomas Finney. His father was a petroleum engineer. After graduating from Caltech in 1979 with a degree in engineering, he worked for a company that developed video games like Astroblast and Space Attack. As a young man, Mr. Finney developed an interest in preserving life through cryonic freezing until better, life-enhancing technologies were invented, said a college roommate, Yin Shih. In 1992, Mr. Finney visited the Alcor facility with his wife to determine whether he wanted to sign up his family to be preserved in Alcor's ''containment vessels.'' ''In my personal opinion, anyone born today has a better than 50-50 chance of living effectively forever,'' he wrote at the time. Mr. Finney remained an employee of the P.G.P. Corporation until his retirement in 2011, working from his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. In the last few years, Mr. Finney was able to move only his facial muscles, but he communicated and wrote Bitcoin-related software using a computer that tracked his eye movement. ''I'm pretty lucky overall,'' Mr. Finney wrote on a Bitcoin website in 2013. ''Even with the A.L.S., my life is very satisfying.'' As the price of Bitcoins rose, his family, to pay for his medical care, was able to sell some of the coins he secured in the early days. Besides his son, Jason, and his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Erin Finney; two sisters, Kathleen Finney and Patricia Wolf; and a brother, Michael. His wife, a physical therapist whom he met at Caltech, spent most of her days caring for him in his final years. After Mr. Finney's death, the freezing of his remains was announced by another futurist, Max More. ''Hal,'' he wrote in a statement online. ''I know I speak for many when I say that I look forward to speaking to you again sometime in the future and to throwing a party in honor of your revival.'' "
Regulators and Hackers Put Bitcoin to the Test,"Bitcoin is facing significant growing pains as it struggles to move beyond a stormy adolescence. After months of hype and hysteria that have driven up its price at a dizzying pace, Bitcoin recently encountered several hurdles that are likely to determine whether it makes it out of its early speculative phase to become a currency that people actually use, is supplanted by a rival or falls apart altogether. The most fundamental threat was a bug in some basic software that determines how Bitcoins are moved between digital accounts. That forced several of the largest Bitcoin exchanges to shut down for most of last week and raised questions about the sturdiness of the programming underlying the currency.  At the same time, the system proved vulnerable to a hacking attack, creating doubts about the strength of the network's security. Regulators also indicated last week that they were moving ahead with new rules for virtual currencies, leading to some fears that burdensome laws could halt Bitcoin in its tracks. These worries sent the price of Bitcoin swinging between a high of about $700 last Monday and a low of $530 on Friday, with some expecting even bigger declines. The current prices are down from highs of about $1,200 in December. ''We are at this inflection point where the hard questions are being asked and will hopefully soon be answered,'' Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State's top financial regulator, said in an interview. Bitcoin has already survived several bouts of volatility that were even wilder than the one last week. But during those crises, nearly everyone involved was a speculator and the currency was much further from real-world success. Now that Silicon Valley and Wall Street have begun to buy in, and everyday uses for Bitcoin are becoming more common, the stakes are much higher. In the same week that Bitcoin was besieged by hackers, Overstock.com, one of the largest companies to accept Bitcoin as payment, said it was nearing $1 million in purchases made with the currency. Mr. Lawsky has been leading efforts to write regulations for virtual currencies, in part to improve confidence in the system. At an all-day event last Tuesday at the New America Foundation, a nonprofit public policy institute, Mr. Lawsky said he hoped to ''put forward, during the course of 2014, a proposed regulatory framework for virtual currency firms operating in New York.'' The same day, Canada's finance minister, Jim Flaherty, announced his plan to create national rules for what has been a largely lawless space. These efforts are more encouraging for Bitcoin's future than Russia's recent decision to declare virtual currencies illegal. But the Bitcoin Financial Association started a petition to Mr. Lawsky titled ''Please Do Not Regulate Bitcoin,'' in which it argued that Bitcoin was too young and vulnerable to be able to survive significant regulations. Other supporters, however, have recently been pressing for closer cooperation with both regulators and banks. One of the most contentious efforts by some Bitcoin entrepreneurs has been a proposal to tag the digital coins to make it possible to determine if a particular coin had been used for illegal activities. Such a system would make banks more comfortable in handling Bitcoin transactions. But the effort has faced intense opposition from early Bitcoin adopters who were drawn to the virtual currency because it allowed them to avoid scrutiny from governments and banks. This is only one of the disputes dividing the community of Bitcoin supporters. The winners will determine whether the virtual currency will simply be absorbed into the existing financial system or whether it will remain a new tool for people who want to circumvent the government and Wall Street, occasionally for illegal purposes like buying drugs or weapons. Susan Athey, a professor of economics at Stanford Business School, pointed to several potential outcomes. It is possible, she said, that banks will simply adopt some of the best elements of the Bitcoin program that allow money to be transferred almost instantaneously. Other alternative virtual currencies could also rise up without Bitcoin's perceived flaws, like the limit on the number of Bitcoins that can ever be created. Professor Athey is assuming that ''some of each of these things happen,'' she said. ''Once you look at it,'' she added, ''you say, 'How is it we are still using these archaic financial rails?' '' But if Bitcoin is to have any chance of success, its digital architecture is going to have to prove its sturdiness under increasingly difficult conditions. The most recent doubts were raised when a Bitcoin exchange that was once the largest in the world, Mt. Gox, almost shut down completely after discovering that customers could make transactions disappear from its records. While this initially appeared to be a problem limited solely to Mt. Gox, it spread to several other large exchanges, and the Bitcoin Foundation acknowledged that it was a flaw that developers had long been aware of. With the issue out in the open, hackers began an attack on the main exchanges. All of this put the developers who work on Bitcoin's open-source computer code into a frenzy of programming. The chief scientist at the foundation, Gavin Andresen, posted his activity on Twitter on Thursday: ''Today was about ignoring people and Deep Coding.'' By Friday, it appeared that the problem was largely under control, and the largest exchange, Bitstamp, reopened. That helped the price of a Bitcoin rise to $660 on Friday evening from $532 in the morning. Jeff Garzik, one of the currency's longtime developers, said that the problems exposed last week should not be a long-term issue for the network. But he acknowledged that Bitcoin would still face significant tests. ''We're still a very young ecosystem,'' said Mr. Garzik, who now works for the Bitcoin company Bitpay. ''I'm certain that bigger and much more devastating attacks will occur in Bitcoin's lifetime. That's the nature of the beast.'' Mr. Garzik expressed his confidence in Bitcoin's ability to survive attacks because of the collaborative nature of the programmers working on it. At the same time, he said that he was drawn to Bitcoin not because he thought it would take over the world but because it was a ''fascinating experiment at several levels.'' The last year, he said, was a year of ''increasing visibility.'' The next year, he said ''will be the year of action.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Hacked vs. Hackers: Game On,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Paul Kocher, one of the country's leading cryptographers, says he thinks the explanation for the world's dismal state of digital security may lie in two charts. One shows the number of airplane deaths per miles flown, which decreased to one-thousandth of what it was in 1945 with the advent of the Federal Aviation Administration in 1958 and stricter security and maintenance protocols. The other, which details the number of new computer security threats, shows the opposite. There has been more than a 10,000-fold increase in the number of new digital threats over the last 12 years. The problem, Mr. Kocher and security experts reason, is a lack of liability and urgency. The Internet is still largely held together with Band-Aid fixes. Computer security is not well regulated, even as enormous amounts of private, medical and financial data and the nation's computerized critical infrastructure -- oil pipelines, railroad tracks, water treatment facilities and the power grid -- move online.  If a stunning number of airplanes in the United States crashed tomorrow, there would be investigations, lawsuits and a cutback in air travel, and the airlines' stock prices would most likely plummet. That has not been true for hacking attacks, which surged 62 percent last year, according to the security company Symantec. As for long-term consequences, Home Depot, which suffered the worst security breach of any retailer in history this year, has seen its stock float to a high point. In a speech two years ago, Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary, predicted it would take a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor'' -- a crippling attack that would cause physical destruction and loss of life -- to wake up the nation to the vulnerabilities in its computer systems. No such attack has occurred. Nonetheless, at every level, there has been an awakening that the threats are real and growing worse, and that the prevailing ''patch and pray'' approach to computer security simply will not do. So what happened? The Wake-Up Call A bleak recap: In the last two years, breaches have hit the White House, the State Department, the top federal intelligence agency, the largest American bank, the top hospital operator, energy companies, retailers and even the Postal Service. In nearly every case, by the time the victims noticed that hackers were inside their systems, their most sensitive government secrets, trade secrets and customer data had already left the building. And in just the last week Sony Pictures Entertainment had to take computer systems offline because of an aggressive attack on its network. The impact on consumers has been vast. Last year, over 552 million people had their identities stolen, according to Symantec, and nearly 25,000 Americans had sensitive health information compromised -- every day -- according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Over half of Americans, including President Obama, had to have their credit cards replaced at least once because of a breach, according to the Ponemon Group, an independent research organization. Graphic: 18 Months of Breaches, Flaws and Revelations But the value of those stolen credit cards, which trade freely in underground criminal markets, is eclipsed by the value of the intellectual property that has been siphoned out of United States corporations, universities and research groups by hackers in China -- so much so that security experts now say there are only two types of companies left in the United States: those that have been hacked and those that do not yet know they have been hacked. And this year, American companies learned it was not just Beijing they were up against. Thanks to revelations by the former intelligence agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, companies worry about protecting their networks from their own government. If the tech sector cannot persuade foreign customers that their data is safe from the National Security Agency, the tech industry analysis firm Forrester Research predicts that America's cloud computing industry stands to lose $180 billion -- a quarter of its current revenue -- over the next two years to competitors abroad. ''People are finally realizing that we have a problem that most had not thought about before,'' said Peter G. Neumann, a computer security pioneer at SRI International, the Silicon Valley engineering research laboratory. ''We may have finally reached a crossroads.'' Is There a Playbook? Only certain kinds of companies, like hospitals and banks, are held up to scrutiny by government regulators when they are hacked. And legal liability hasn't been established in the courts, though Target faces dozens of lawsuits related to a hack of that company's computer network a little over a year ago. But if there is a silver lining to the current predicament, Mr. Neumann and other security experts say, it is that computer security, long an afterthought, has been forced into the national consciousness. Customers, particularly those abroad, are demanding greater privacy protections. Corporations are elevating security experts to senior roles and increasing their budgets. At Facebook, the former mantra ''move fast and break things'' has been replaced. It is now ''move slowly and fix things.'' Companies in various sectors have started informal information-sharing groups for computer security. And President Obama recently called on Congress to pass a national data breach law to provide ''one clear national standard'' rather than the current patchwork of state laws that dictate how companies should respond to data breaches. There is growing recognition that there is no silver bullet. Firewalls and antivirus software alone cannot keep hackers out, so corporations are beginning to take a more layered approach to data protection. Major retailers have pledged to adopt more secure payment schemes by the end of next year. Banks are making it easier for customers to monitor their monthly statements for identity theft. And suddenly, pie-in-the-sky ideas that languished in research labs for years are being evaluated by American hardware makers for use in future products. ''People are recognizing that existing technologies aren't working,'' said Richard A. Clarke, the first cybersecurity czar at the White House. ''It's almost impossible to think of a company that hasn't been hacked -- the Pentagon's secret network, the White House, JPMorgan -- it is pretty obvious that prevention and detection technologies are broken.'' Companies that continue to rely on prevention and detection technologies like firewalls and antivirus products are considered sitting ducks. ''People are still dealing with this problem in a technical way, not a strategic way,'' said Scott Borg, the head of the United States Cyber Consequences Unit, a nonprofit organization. ''People are not thinking about who would attack us, what their motives would be, what they would try to do. The focus on the technology is allowing these people to be blindsided. ''They are looking obsessively at new penetrations,'' Mr. Borg said. ''But once someone is inside, they can carry on for months unnoticed.'' The Keys to Preparation The companies most prepared for online attacks, Mr. Borg and other experts say, are those that have identified their most valuable assets, like a university's groundbreaking research, a multinational's acquisition strategy, Boeing's blueprints to the next generation of stealth bomber or Target's customer data. Those companies take additional steps to protect that data by isolating it from the rest of their networks and encrypting it. That approach -- what the N.S.A. has termed ''defense in depth'' -- is slowly being adopted by the private sector. Now, in addition to firewalls and antivirus products, companies are incorporating breach detection plans, more secure authentication schemes, technologies that ''white list'' traffic and allow in only what is known to be good, encryption and the like. ''We're slowly getting combinations of new technologies that deal with this problem,'' Mr. Clarke said. The most prominent examples are Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook. Mr. Snowden revealed that the N.S.A. might have been grabbing data from those companies in unencrypted form as it passed between their respective data centers. Now, they all encrypt their traffic as it flows internally between their own data centers. Though intelligence analysts may disagree, security experts say all of this is a step in the right direction. But security experts acknowledge that even the most advanced security defenses can break down. A widely used technology sold by FireEye, one of the market leaders in breach detection, failed to detect malicious code in an independent lab test this year. The product successfully identified 93 percent of the threats, but as the testers pointed out, it is not the 99 percent of detected threats that matter. It is the 1 percent that are missed that allow hackers to pull off a heist. Even when security technologies do as advertised, companies are still missing the alerts. Six months before Target was breached last year, it installed a $1.6 million FireEye intrusion detection system. When hackers tripped the system, FireEye sounded alarms to the company's security team in Bangalore, which flagged the alert for Target's team at its headquarters in Minneapolis. Then nobody reacted until 40 million credit card numbers and information on 70 million more customers had been sent to computers in Russia, according to several investigators. Part of the problem, security chiefs say, is ''false positives,'' the constant pinging of alerts anytime an employee enters a new database or downloads a risky app or email attachment. The result, they complain, is a depletion of resources and attention. ''We don't need 'big data.' We need big information,'' said Igor Baikalov, a former senior vice president for global information security at Bank of America, now chief scientist at Securonix, a private company that sells threat intelligence to businesses. Securonix is part of a growing class of security start-ups, which includes Exabeam and Vectra Networks in Silicon Valley and several other companies that use the deluge of data from employee computers and personal devices to give security officers intelligence they can act on. Many companies in the Fortune 500 are building their own systems that essentially do the same thing. These technologies correlate unusual activity across multiple locations, then raise an alarm if they start to look like a risk. For example, the technologies would increase the urgency of an alert if an employee suddenly downloaded large amounts of data from a database not regularly used, while simultaneously communicating with a computer in China. The future of security, experts say, won't be based on digital walls and moats but on these kinds of newer data-driven approaches. ''Most large organizations have come to the painful recognition that they are already in some state of break-in today,'' said Asheem Chandna, a venture capital investor at Greylock Partners. ''They are realizing they need to put new and advanced sensors in their network that continuously monitor what is going on.'' While much progress is being made, security experts bemoan that there is still little to prevent hackers from breaking in in the first place. In May, the F.B.I. led a crackdown on digital crime that resulted in 90 arrests, and Robert Anderson, one of the F.B.I.'s top officers on such cases, said the agency planned to take a more aggressive stance. ''There is a philosophy change. If you are going to attack Americans, we are going to hold you accountable,'' he said at a cybersecurity meeting in Washington. Still, arrests of hackers are few and far between. ''If you look at an attacker's expected benefit and expected risk, the equation is pretty good for them,'' said Howard Shrobe, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Nothing is going to change until we can get their expected net gain close to zero or -- God willing -- in the negative.'' Until last year, Dr. Shrobe was a manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as Darpa, overseeing the agency's Clean Slate program, a multiproject ''Do Over'' for the computer security industry. The program included two separate but related projects. Their premise was to reconsider computing from the ground up and design new computer systems that are much harder to break into and that recover quickly when they have been breached. '' 'Patch and pray' is not a strategic answer,'' Dr. Shrobe said. ''If that's all you do, you're going to drown.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Yahoo Reports Hackers Accessed Email Accounts,"Another day, another breach. In yet another reminder of the importance of using different passwords across different websites, Yahoo said Thursday that attackers had attempted to gain access to Yahoo Mail accounts using usernames and passwords collected from a breach on a third-party site.  ''Recently, we identified a coordinated effort to gain unauthorized access to Yahoo Mail accounts,'' Jay Rossiter, Yahoo's senior vice president for platforms and personalization products, wrote in a blog post Thursday. ''Based on our current findings, the list of usernames and passwords that were used to execute the attack was likely collected from a third-party database compromise.'' Mr. Rossiter did not say how many accounts were affected, only that Yahoo had reset passwords for affected accounts and added two-step verification, a system that asks users to enter a second, one-time password. The company said it was also working with law enforcement to investigate the breach and had stepped up security on its systems. Yahoo was affected by a similar attack in 2012, when hackers stole 400,000 usernames and passwords from a Yahoo contributor network. And earlier this year, Yahoo was the target of an attack in which cybercriminals planted malware in advertisements served on Yahoo's site. When the ad was clicked, the attackers were able to use victims' computers to mine for Bitcoins, the virtual currency. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Tally of Cyber Extortion Attacks on Tech Companies Grows,"Tech start-ups continue to get hit by extortion attempts from cybercriminals who aim to shut down their systems until companies pay their ransom. For several months, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating a wave of so-called denial-of-service, or DDoS attacks, against web start-ups. In each case, attackers knock their victims offline using a flood of traffic and refuse to stop until victims pay their ransom in Bitcoins. Among the businesses targeted in the initial wave of attacks were Vimeo, the video-sharing company; Meetup, a company that connects groups offline; Basecamp, a project management software company; Bit.ly, the link-shortening service;  Shutterstock, the stock photography agency, and MailChimp, the email marketing provider. In nearly every case, the amount demanded was typically low, in the $300 range. And in some cases, one security consultant said, the victims paid the ransom.  Among the companies targeted in just the last month have been Feedly, a service that aggregates web content; Evernote, the productivity service; and Moz, which makes marketing analytics software. On Thursday, Move, a San Jose, Calif. start-up that provides online real estate services, was added to the list. At Moz, Anthony Skinner, the company's chief technology officer, said in an interview that initially the hacker -  or a group of hackers who use the same email address - asked for $200 to stop attacks on their system. When the company refused to pay, Mr. Skinner said, the ransom demand increased to $2,000. Moz has since signed up with services like CloudFlare, a company that helps mitigate DDoS attacks by spreading traffic among systems around the world, but Mr. Skinner said the attacker has found new ways to attack their systems. ""If we move one way, they come after us a different way,"" Mr. Skinner said. ""It's a game of cat-and-mouse at this point."" Mr. Skinner said the attackers (or attacker) have covered their tracks using anonymity software and flooding companies from thousands of different IP addresses in the United States. Those addresses are likely to be bots, or computers infected with malware that allow the hackers to apply them to an attack.  Moz is working with other affected companies, including Feedly, but said that because each company has different infrastructure, and because the attack methods differ, sharing information about the extortion attacks only provides so much help. ""We're all getting hit differently and so banding together can only do so much, beyond commiserating with your friends,"" Mr. Skinner said. He said the attacks have been frustrating not just for Moz and its employees, but for the company's customers, who don't understand why their systems are being impacted. On Thursday, Move, the online real estate company, was the latest company to fall victim. The company said the attack, which began Tuesday, was still going on Thursday and had made realtor.com, the official website of the National Association of Realtors, and other Move web services inaccessible. In a statement, Move said its network service providers were trying to resolve its shutdown and working closely with law enforcement to track down the attackers. The F.B.I. is looking into the attacks, according to two people close to the inquiry who would speak only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about a continuing investigation. They said the agency was operating under the assumption that the attacks were the work of the same culprit, or group of culprits. Jennifer Shearer, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I.,  declined to comment. DDoS attacks in general are on the rise, according to Arbor Networks, a security firm in Burlington, Mass., after a ""hockey stick"" growth trajectory. But last year, the frequency of such attacks jumped eightfold from the previous year, and the size of the attacks eclipsed previous peaks by over 200 percent, according to a report by the firm. And while no numbers have been published on the uptick in extortion attacks, security firms that mitigate DDoS attacks say that their business is more than doubling, in part because of the extortion attempts. At CloudFlare, for instance, Matthew Prince, the company's chief executive, said CloudFlare had increased revenue 450 percent last year because of greater interest in its service. Tech start-ups are a ripe target because they often lack the sophisticated security architecture of a larger company, and because they depend on around-the-clock Internet access for their livelihood. That is the reason some say an alarming number of start-ups have paid the ransom, in hopes it would just go away. At Moz, Mr. Skinner said the attacker continues to demand $2,000 to stop the flood of attacks, but Moz refuses to pay. ""This is a sad case of a sad person,"" Mr. Skinner said. ""For them it's a big game. For us, it's a huge waste of time.""                       "
Computing Goes to the Cloud. So Does Crime.,"As more of our world, from family photos to financial information, moves into the cloud, malicious hackers are following. It is easy to see why: Cloud computing systems contain lots of critical information, from sensitive corporate and personal financial data to government secrets and even nude photographs never meant to be shared. All of it has been targeted by hackers, and in many cases stolen. In 2009, a password-stealing ""botnet,"" or collection of malevolent software, was found inside Amazon Web Services, perhaps the world's largest cloud-computing system. More recently, celebrities' private photos were stolen from Apple's iCloud storage system.  IBM says its researchers regularly receive taunts from Russian hackers who leave them mocking messages in software aimed at stealing from the 300 banks IBM serves. ""Talk about hand-to-hand combat,"" said Marc van Zadelhoff, vice president for strategy at IBM Security Systems. ""People are salivating at the chance of stealing money. The darker side of society thinks fast, out of desperation."" Cloud computing systems are collections of server and mainframe computers, sometimes over one million, made into a single collective via software that disperses data and computing chores among them. Because there is less waste and more flexibility in this sharing, the computing whole is far greater than the sum of its computer parts. Many clouds are privately owned and controlled, inside corporate and government facilities. The biggest and fastest-growing systems are ""public clouds,"" from the likes of Amazon, Google, Microsoft and many telecommunications providers. Both kinds of clouds share information across many points, both inside their own networks and with external devices like smartphones. Much of the older software being moved from regular servers to the cloud were not designed for use there, making the transition particularly vulnerable. In addition, conventional security precautions, such as firewalls that establish a perimeter around a company's resources, are far less useful in a cloud. ""They are now fundamentally irrelevant,"" Mr. van Zadelhoff said. ""The notion of a perimeter, where your computing begins and ends, is obliterated in the cloud."" Hackers may want to be inside clouds for more than just sensitive data, since cloud computing systems are places where supercomputer-quality processing power can be rented. That makes them useful in developing new and strong types of malware. At the Black Hat security conference last summer, two researchers, Bob Ragan and Oscar Salazar, showed how to build a cloud-based botnet for no money at all, simply by using the free-trial offers of many cloud-based businesses. That processing power hijacked from others can be deployed for moneymaking schemes besides botnets, like ""mining,"" or creating, new units of the cybercurrency Bitcoin without paying for machine time. Just as recent hacks reached critical information through innocuous-seeming things like heating and air-conditioning systems that were networked to other computers, cloud systems may have even more pathways in, and a greater number of potential targets out - basically, any connected devices. Not far away, devices for health monitoring and building control, among other things, will make for even richer targets, says Steven Weber, who recently received a $15 million grant to start a center for long-term cybersecurity at the University of California, Berkeley. ""In a couple of years we're not just going to be talking about finance and banking,"" he said. ""We're going to be talking about control of your heart rate, what you eat, how you live. That's where all this is going, with all kinds of critical stuff going into an environment with possibly variable security."" While caution is necessary, not all is doom and gloom. For one thing, the concentration of core computing systems into clouds means that computers are likely to be better managed, security flaws more frequently and thoroughly patched, and devices inspected in a more uniform way. All of those things are improvements over the current state of affairs. In addition, companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google have among the world's best security engineers. For the most part, you would rather have those people looking after your data than the generalist information technology workers in the average company. ""We have a greater concentration of resources, so we can have specialized teams with better tools,"" said James Hamilton, a senior executive overseeing the design and construction of Amazon Web Services. In addition, with customers including the Central Intelligence Agency, the company gets a lot of feedback, and pressure to keep improving itself. Despite the larger scale and new targets in the cloud, most of the methods used in hacking are not changing much. In the case of the celebrity photos, Apple said its investigation revealed that ""accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet."" Elsewhere, even though new malware has more sophistication, it still frequently takes over a computer by affecting the way the system's memory functions. But aspects of the cloud, and greater computing intelligence in general, can be used to combat these threats in new ways. In particular, data can be easily encrypted even when at rest deep within the system, so a hacker will most often lack the ability to read what is captured. Intelligent ""agents"" and pattern-scanning software can be deployed within the cloud to monitor system behavior of virtually every packet, and catch much unorthodox behavior before it happens. In the last few years companies have offered new security approaches. One company, Skyhigh Networks, tries to track all the unregistered applications that come into a corporate cloud via an employee's smartphone, then close off applications that do not look as if they have good security. Another, SentinelOne, uses data analysis and agents to predict attacks before they can do damage. And Illumio provides visualizations of interactions between applications and the cloud to create decisions about how to maintain security, then encrypts data as it travels through the cloud. ""The solution is probes and sensors - you melt analytics everywhere,"" said Mr. van Zadelhoff of IBM, which besides security analytics is moving older software to the cloud. ""Over the past 20 years, there are moments when the bad guys are ahead, and we catch up. They're ahead now, but we'll catch up again.""                       "
Hacking Reality: When Art Imitates Technology,"UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- At a critical moment in Michael Mann's cyberthriller, ''Blackhat,'' a naïve security guard slips a young woman's thumb drive into his corporate computer. The camera lingers on the drive's all-uppercase brand name: SONY. A few covert keystrokes later, the system is penetrated -- one hacker, a good guy, is within reach of an illicit fortune stolen by another. If this is not exactly cinematic art imitating life, the release of ''Blackhat'' by Universal Pictures next month will at least show spooky synchronicity with the very real hacking attack on Universal's crosstown competitor, Sony Pictures. Set to open on Jan. 16, Mr. Mann's movie is one of the most authentic film treatments of malicious hacking in memory -- and it has been given added cultural urgency by inadvertently crossing paths with the Sony assault. Hollywood has always had a hard time turning computer code and venomous software into captivating cinema. But Mr. Mann, who wrung three Oscar nominations from ''The Insider,'' his 1999 story of a tobacco company whistle-blower, has spent years on ''Blackhat,'' partly in an effort to bridge the gap between film and what he saw as an underappreciated mass threat posed by hackers.  ''We're not cutting edge in tech specificity -- we're engaged in our story -- but we are close,'' Mr. Mann said on Saturday of his film's presentation of the hackers' methods. (A ''black hat'' is jargon for a criminal hacker, in contrast to legitimate digital security experts, or ''white hats.'') As for generating audience interest, Sony and North Korea may have ended up lending Universal marketers a hand. ''Blackhat,'' produced by Legendary Pictures for about $80 million, is arriving in near lock step with the devastating attack that has crippled Sony and that last week was declared a national security threat by President Obama. Hackers digitally ransacked Sony, based in Culver City, Calif., in late November, resulting in the publication of private emails, Social Security numbers and other personal data. The unprecedented attack, which was likely to have been carried out by North Korea, according to the F.B.I., ultimately led to terrorist threats on movie theaters and the cancellation of ''The Interview,'' a Sony comedy that depicts the killing of Kim Jong-un, the current ruler of North Korea. ''The hack on Sony gave emotional stakes to the geeky hacking world,'' said Hemanshu Nigam, a former executive at News Corporation and the Motion Picture Association of America who now runs SSP Blue, an online security firm. Members of the mass audience, he said, finally realized, ''This could be me, with my embarrassing personal email conversations and creative work in progress stolen for everyone to see.'' ''Blackhat'' is the tale of one sophisticated, contemporary hacker on the trail of another. The film's antihero, played by Chris Hemsworth, is promised his prison sentence will be commuted if he can stop a particularly malicious cyberterrorist who is using Mr. Hemsworth's character's own ingenious code. The stakes are even higher than those in the Sony attack. ''Blackhat'' begins with a hack-induced explosion at a Chinese nuclear plant. The ensuing character-driven chase, grounded in Mr. Mann's considerable research, involves cocky one-upmanship among hackers and stylistic touches to convey the invisible movement of malicious software (pinpoints of light creeping through a digital network, for instance, and typing shown from inside the keyboard looking out). Mr. Mann has been making last-minute calibrations to his film, but even if he wanted to flick at what happened to Sony it would be too late. Still, ''Blackhat,'' conceived two and a half years ago, manages to be astonishingly current. ''How you invade a system usually involves some kind of social engineering,'' Mr. Mann said, like tricking an employee into enabling an attack, as with the fatal insertion of the seemingly innocent Sony thumb drive. In another moment from ''Blackhat,'' a government agent is fooled into changing his security password. Some security experts have speculated that there were similar elements in the attack on Sony. One of the film's more striking messages, and a lesson that Hollywood has certainly learned over the last week, is that there are no international barriers to cybercrimes. Law enforcement agencies, restrained by local regulations and their own bureaucracies, chase invisible criminals who move with the ease of a keystroke from China to the United States to Malaysia and elsewhere. Government officials have said the attacks on Sony appear to have been routed by North Korea through China and then conducted through servers in Singapore, Thailand and Bolivia. Mr. Mann, whose films include ''Ali,'' ''Heat'' and ''Public Enemies,'' said he became interested in a hacker-centered story after spending time in Washington with government cyberdefense officials. ''What became apparent is that Washington knew -- the White House, defense, law enforcement -- how truly vulnerable we are to cyberintrusion,'' Mr. Mann, who wrote the screenplay with Morgan Davis Foehl, said in a telephone interview. They were, he said, ''frustrated in getting defense contractors, banking and infrastructure providers to act on the need for robust cyberdefense.'' He added: ''Generally, people have little awareness of how porous we are. That gap in awareness was fascinating to me.'' Universal declined to discuss its marketing plans for ''Blackhat.'' People with knowledge of the studio's plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid conflict with Universal, said no effort was being made to tie ''Blackhat'' to the Sony hacking in trailers, TV ads or other promotional materials. According to these people, Universal is slightly concerned that the Sony attack might actually hurt ''Blackhat'' -- ticket buyers could be tired of hacking stories after weeks of media attention on Sony, and a film that is too topical might strike potential viewers as less entertaining. As a genre, cyberthrillers have been a challenge for Hollywood. Studios have repeatedly been drawn to the sophistication and latent power in the digital world, while wrestling with ways to make its abstractions cinematic. Bill Condon, a filmmaker who won an Oscar for writing ''Gods and Monsters,'' stumbled badly last year with ''The Fifth Estate,'' about the WikiLeaks mastermind, Julian Assange. A $28 million DreamWorks Studios film, it generated only $8.6 million in worldwide ticket sales. In particular, Mr. Condon puzzled viewers with his portrayal of Mr. Assange's virtual ''submissions platform'' as a stark office space filled, at one point, with rows of smiling Assanges. ''Sneakers,'' ''WarGames,'' ''The Net'' and ''Tron'' -- the 1982 fantasy in which Jeff Bridges engaged in combat with computer programs -- did better in their time, though all faced the challenge of wrapping visual elements and human adventures around essentially invisible action. Like ''The Fifth Estate,'' the 1995 movie ''Hackers,'' about computer-savvy high-schoolers involved with corporate extortion, was a notable miss, notwithstanding the popularity of its avant-garde electronic music soundtrack. Ralph Winter, a producer of ''Hackers,'' said the music was chosen by the movie's director, Iain Softley, partly to lure young viewers to the intricacies of a digital plot. ''I think the soundtrack did better than the film,'' he said. "
"Hackers Target Video Games for Fun, Profit and Better Scores","Hackers are breaking into American companies for credit card numbers, passwords, trade secrets and - it turns out - for phony video game scores. For the past five years, hackers inside China have been breaking into American video game makers' systems, collecting proprietary source code in an ambitious effort to crack the games for free use and to develop tools to cheat them, according to research by the counter threat unit at Dell SecureWorks, a security firm that was acquired by Dell in 2011. In several cases, researchers say, amateur Chinese hackers have proven themselves even more stealthy and sophisticated than their military counterparts. So adept are they at covering their tracks that, in some cases, they have been able to maintain a foothold in infiltrated systems for more than two years unnoticed.  The new research offers a reminder that despite the continued focus on hackers at the National Security Agency and military units in Shanghai, some of the most prolific and sophisticated attacks are still the work of individual hackers. Dell SecureWorks would not name the victims, citing nondisclosure agreements the company has with clients, but its report may help shed light on a string of attacks against video game makers. In the past year alone, Nintendo reported that it had been a victim of an attack in which hackers managed to gain unauthorized access to a Nintendo members reward site 23,000 times, after some 15 million attempts.  Ubisoft, based in Montreal, announced that its networks had also been hacked. Japanese game maker Konami said hackers had tried to gain access to its systems some 4 million times and were successful in 35,000 cases. Crytek, the game developer, also reported a breach.  In March, a British security company discovered that an Electronic Arts server had been hacked. And just last May, Bohemia Interactive, a Czech game developer, confirmed that it too had been hacked after the source code for its DayZ game appeared on a game-hacking forum. Dell SecureWorks' researchers said that in many of the cases they had witnessed, hackers conducted extensive reconnaissance on their victim organizations before attacking them. They used public information to track down employees with administrative privileges, then used so-called brute force means in which they deployed computers to test millions of combinations of user names and passwords to break into their accounts.  From there, they used their foothold to install malicious tools, including remote access tools, backdoors and keystroke loggers, onto the computers of employees who had access to video game source code. At first, researchers said it was unclear whether hackers were stealing source code to copy games and sell their own versions. But they were able to trace the attacks back to two hacker aliases in China who are active in China's video game cracking community. The researchers now believe the hackers are after the source code to crack the games for free use, or find backdoors that would allow them to outscore their competitors. Researchers traced several tools back to the online alias ""Laurentiu Moon,"" a Chinese hacker who maintains accounts on hacking websites: one focused on mobile phone hacking and another focused on cracking legitimate software. Laurentiu Moon has been a member of China Cracking Group since 2009 and the AntiGameProtect since last December. Both are dedicated to video game cracking. Other tools were traced to another member of the China Cracking Group, with the alias ""Sincoder."" Based on the individual's Weibo microblogging profile and a Twitter account, it appears this person is based in Shenzhen, China. Efforts to reach these individuals through their online accounts were unsuccessful. In some cases, researchers said, the tools and techniques these two individuals developed were more sophisticated than many of the so-called spear phishing attacks deployed by China's People's Liberation Army hacking units, like the Shanghai-based Unit 61398 and aerospace hacking Unit 61486. Rather than fire off emails to victims hoping for a click, these game hackers used sophisticated brute force tactics to break in. Researchers found in one case that they successfully compromised a Chinese technology company's digital certificate - a signing mechanism used by companies to guarantee to a customer's web browser that their site is authentic - to gain access.  Surprisingly, given the number of gamers constantly trying to crack makers' systems, the industry has done little to share cyber threat information. A spokesman for the Entertainment Software Association, the gaming industry's chief lobbying group, said he was unaware of any joint efforts to curb game hacking. In most cases, game makers said it is up to the individual companies to protect themselves. Dell's Counter Threat report, which lists hackers aliases and tools and details their techniques, might offer a start.

Michaels Stores' Breach Involved 3 Million Customers,"Michaels Stores, the arts and crafts retailer, estimates that data on three million of its customers' payment cards may have been stolen in a breach over several months. Michaels first acknowledged that it was investigating a possible breach in January, not long after it was revealed that Target experienced one of the largest recorded data breaches in history, affecting about 100 million customers. Several other retailers and a hotel company have since disclosed similar breaches that have put the online security of consumers and cybercrime under scrutiny.  In a statement posted on its website late Thursday, Michaels said that two security firms had found evidence of a breach at Michaels and at a subsidiary, Aaron Brothers, a framing company. The computer hack involved ''highly sophisticated malware that had not been encountered previously by either of the security firms,'' the company said. Like the Target breach, the attack at Michaels invaded its point-of-sale systems. There are more than 1,135 Michaels stores and 119 Aaron Brothers locations, and the company has posted two long lists of branches that were affected on its website. ''In an era where very sophisticated and determined criminals have proven capable of successfully attacking a wide range of computer networks, we must all increase our level of vigilance,'' Chuck Rubin, chief executive of Michaels, said in a statement. The retailer said that its systems were exposed at various Michaels stores in the United States from May 8, 2013, to Jan. 27, 2014, exposing information like credit and debit card numbers and expiration dates. At this point, the company said it believed that personal information like names and addresses had not been hacked. About 2.6 million cards may have been revealed to hackers during that time, or about 7 percent of the cards used at Michaels stores in the United States over those nine months. At Aaron Brothers, which sells custom frames and art supplies, 400,000 customer cards may have been exposed, the company said. Its systems were compromised at 54 stores from June 26, 2013, to Feb. 27, 2014 -- more than a month after the company said publicly that it may have been hacked. The data breaches at Michaels and Target, as well as at Neiman Marcus, were believed to be committed by a loose band of criminals in Eastern Europe. The fallout from these hackings has been widespread and has affected many millions of people whose personal or payment data has been exposed. At Target, which experienced by far the worst of the recent breaches, its fourth-quarter profit was down 46 percent from the period a year earlier, and executives said there was a significant decline in traffic and sales after the breach became public. Last month, the company's highest-ranking technology executive, Beth M. Jacob, resigned. And John J. Mulligan, Target's chief financial officer, has testified before Senate panels, along with an executive from Neiman Marcus, and others. Some banks have reissued credit and debit cards with new numbers after learning that their customers had become vulnerable by shopping at those stores. Eager to keep a widespread theft from happening again, retailers and trade groups have been calling for a swift transition to a payment card technology, widely used in Europe and considered more secure, called EMV, which relies on a small chip embedded in each card rather than a magnetic strip. This week, the National Retail Federation announced that it would create a platform through which retailers could obtain and share information on online security threats. Little information was exchanged among some of the companies in the past. ''Establishing a new program takes time,'' Matthew Shay, president of the federation, said in a statement, ''but time is not our friend when it comes to stopping these sophisticated and unpredictable criminals.''

"A New Crime With a Catchy Name, 'Spoofing'","Giving a crime a catchy moniker is a good way to get attention when prosecutors pursue a new form of misconduct. There is, for instance, a type of money laundering called ""smurfing,"" named for the cute blue cartoon characters, that involves runners for a drug organization making small cash deposits at various banks to avoid the currency transaction reporting rules.   Now, there's ""spoofing,"" a form of market manipulation. Last week, the Justice Department filed charges against Michael Coscia in what it said was the first criminal indictment for ""spoofing."" While not quite as evocative as the smurfs, spoofing involves an effort to fool market participants into believing there are large orders for futures contracts to draw them into making trades. Mr. Coscia is accused of placing orders that he planned to cancel to induce others to buy or sell in response, thereby artificially driving prices up or down so that he could then trade.  Regulators have begun focusing on spoofing because of the rise of high-frequency trading firms that now account for as much as 50 percent of stock trades. The firms use computer programs to buy and sell securities and futures contracts that react almost instantaneously to small movements in the market.  In July, Reuters reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking at 10 brokers for possible spoofing along with a related form of manipulation called ""layering,"" which involves placing multiple orders at different prices to give the appearance of significant trading interest. Mr. Coscia operated a high-frequency trading firm, Panther Energy Trading, that used computer programs called ""Flash Trader"" and ""Quote Trader"" to execute enter large orders that were quickly canceled to move the price to where he wanted an order executed.  In 2013, he settled civil charges filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission by paying $2.8 million in penalties and disgorgement, along with a $900,000 penalty to the Financial Conduct Authority of Britain for violations in London.  The Dodd-Frank Act specifically gives the commodity commission the authority to pursue spoofing of futures contracts, which is defined as ""bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution.""   The criminal charges raise spoofing to a new level. Mr. Coscia now faces a potential prison sentence of more than five years under the advisory federal sentencing guidelines, based on the claim in the indictment that his trading strategy earned nearly $1.6 million in profits. The Justice Department's prosecution also poses a threat to other high-frequency trading firms that may employ a trading strategy using a high volume of orders that are quickly canceled. In this case, it is interesting to note, the profits from the six trades cited by the government were tiny, and the victims were not sympathetic characters like individual investors or pension funds. The indictment describes how Mr. Coscia's programs would enter small buy or sell orders for future contracts that he wanted to have filled. He then placed large orders on the other side of that trade at a higher or lower price to entice others to enter the market on the belief that the larger order would affect the price. Once the price moved so that his small order was filled, the program canceled the large orders. The program would then do the same transaction in reverse by entering another round of large orders that would move the price up or down to allow for Mr. Coscia to exit the position at a profit. The price differences were small, sometimes fractions of a penny, so that the profits were quite modest on an individual set of trades. The indictment sets out 12 charges against Mr. Coscia, six counts of commodities fraud and six counts of spoofing, based on trading in September 2011.  The total profits from those transactions amounted to about $1,070. Mr. Coscia's firm engaged in thousands of trades to generate the estimated profits of nearly $1.6 million. But prosecutors needed to narrow the charges to just a few transactions if they hoped to obtain a conviction because introducing evidence of every trade would risk putting the judge and jury to sleep. But with just a limited number of trades, there is also the danger that Mr. Coscia's lawyer will question why such small amounts are worthy of a federal prosecution and try to portray the trading as innocuous. As is usually the case in a white-collar crime prosecution, the Justice Department's biggest hurdle will be proving intent. The government must show that the design of the computer program is circumstantial evidence of Mr. Coscia's intent to defraud other traders by misleading them with the large orders that he planned to cancel before they could be filled. It is not a defense to argue that ""everyone else was doing it"" - a point that our mothers and kindergarten teachers drilled into us. But Mr. Coscia can offer a good faith defense, which is available for any crime requiring proof of fraudulent intent. He may try to show that other high-frequency traders routinely cancel orders, with estimates of as many as 90 percent of all orders being canceled before they are executed. It is not a matter of claiming that what he did was right because everyone else did it, but rather that there was no intent to defraud when traders know that most orders quickly disappear and are never filled. The victims of Mr. Coscia's trading strategy may not be appealing to a jury either: other high-frequency trading firms. The indictment describes in detail how a set of trades and canceled orders took place in less than one-tenth of a second. Only firms using computer programs to buy and sell in the blink of an eye could respond to the type of spoofing the Justice Department is prosecuting. So it would not be a surprise if Mr. Coscia argued that these sophisticated firms engaged in similar conduct through their own trading strategies and were not defrauded by orders entered by his program. The indictment seeks to hold Mr. Coscia liable for trades executed in milliseconds by a computer, including one trade at 4:54 a.m. when he was probably asleep. The spoofing charges may send a chill through the high-frequency trading world because the evidence of fraudulent intent will come from a program that uses rapid-fire orders and does not depend on humans for its execution. So finding that Mr. Coscia engaged in spoofing may come down to a jury deciding whether one computer fooling another is a crime. Peter J. Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School, is a co-author of ""Securities Crimes (2d edition)."" Twitter: @peterjhenning                       "
"Mobile Malware: Small Numbers, but Growing","THE warning was dire: A small security company revealed a flaw in millions of smartphones that could allow dangerous software to masquerade as a legitimate app and seize control of a phone. The threat was a big conversation topic at this year's Black Hat security conference. But after that, we didn't hear much more about it. Perhaps that should not be surprising. For some time, computer security companies have been on the lookout for apps meant to do harm to smartphones. But for all the concern, so-called mobile malware has not had much of an impact on regular people. A recent report by the security company McAfee said that there was a 197 percent increase in mobile malware from 2012 to 2013.  The actual number of phones hit by mobile malware, however, is tiny. McAfee said one of the largest mobile infections it was tracking recently -- a kind of malware that can lock your phone and all the data on it and hold it for ransom -- had infected 20,000 to 40,000 mobile users in the United States. By comparison, the recent hack of Home Depot's computer network affected 56 million cardholders. So is mobile malware a threat? Sure. But your threat level depends on who you are. For example, it was reported this week that the Chinese government could be using mobile malware to plant malicious apps on the phones of protesters in Hong Kong. But if you're not a celebrity or a protester, and you're not carrying corporate or government secrets on your device, it is certainly not your biggest computer security problem. And if you practice basic security hygiene on your mobile phone -- good passwords, downloading apps from reputable sources and treating email on a phone with the same caution as on a computer -- it is easily avoided. Phones can get infected when someone accidentally downloads a malicious app. Clicking some ads can also start downloads of malware, and hackers can even pretend to be a public Wi-Fi hot spot to steal personal data. Google's popular Android operating system is the overwhelming target of all these mobile hacking attempts. But Google argues that actual infections are rare, especially in the United States and Europe where most Android phones are running official versions of the operating system and the Google Play or Amazon App Store. Take the Android security hole called ''Master Key'' as an example. The flaw, revealed by Bluebox Security at the Black Hat conference last year, was believed to affect up to 99 percent of Android phones. The fear was that it could be used to turn a real Android app into one that would allow hackers to read personal data on the phone, send premium text messages or call premium numbers. It could even, researchers warned, take control of the phone and make it part of a so-called botnet, a network of hacker-controlled computers or phones usually used to send spam or break encryption schemes. But Adrian Ludwig, who is in charge of Android security at Google, said Master Key and the flaw identified this year, called Fake I.D., didn't end up causing much trouble. ''Neither of them ever had any meaningful impact on user security,'' said Mr. Lugwig. ''On the order of one or two out of every million installs were actually potentially harmful to users.'' Google, like Apple, Microsoft and BlackBerry, works to verify the apps it allows into the Google Play store and even the alternative Amazon App Store. Malicious apps can sometimes find a way in, but it's unusual. Google says most of the infections it sees are in Russia and Vietnam, and they come through unauthorized app stores that aren't vetted by either Google or mobile phone operators. So, downloading apps only from approved sources is an easy preventive step. And Google recently introduced updated app scanning that will continuously check your phone for apps that might be misbehaving. You might encounter more malware if you get programs from other app stores, like those that come preinstalled on non-Google Android phones in other countries or even third-party alternatives that anyone can access, like SlideME or AppsLib. But if you're using a version of Android verified by Google, it has a built-in scanning system that looks for malicious apps from third-party sources, as well. The system, called Verify Apps, is activated automatically when you change your Android settings to allow apps to be installed from somewhere other than the Google Play store. You can turn it off. But if you leave it on, Google says it should catch most bad apps and either warn you that they're dangerous or block them completely. Some carriers in the United States also install security software on the phones they sell, like an app called Lookout Mobile Security. Lookout is included on Android phones you buy from T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint, and can be downloaded from the Apple App Store as well. The company says it has about 60 million users. Kevin Mahaffey, the chief technology officer at Lookout, said about 4 percent of its American users encountered one or more pieces of mobile malware a year. The numbers are much higher in Russia, at 63 percent, and China, at 28 percent, he said. ''On the scale of PC threats, that is lower,'' Mr. Mahaffey said. ''But it's still something people need to be careful of.'' But security companies like McAfee maintain that mobile malware is on the rise and that, while it might not be a major problem now, it's a rising tide. ''We think the threat is real; we think it's a growing threat,'' said Gary Davis, McAfee's chief consumer security evangelist. ''We think there's a laissez-faire attitude with consumers not giving it the same kind of attention they give other threats.'' Malware concerns are more acute in the workplace, where people increasingly bring their own devices and use them for conducting business. McAfee and other security software companies offer apps for both Android and iOS that will scan other apps for potential security threats and known malware. The apps can also alert you if a program is asking for access to more of your phone than seems necessary, Mr. Davis said. ''Why would a flashlight app need to see contact list and call records?'' he said. ''That just opens them up for abuse from other sources.'' These apps, along with Lookout, are free. But common sense can keep the average consumer covered. When you're downloading apps, security experts say you should pay attention to how long they've been on the market and whether they have good ratings from other users. Use a good password to lock down your phone in case it's lost or stolen. And if you get an email with a link to a site that looks like your bank but is asking for your password, stop and double-check the link. Or just call the bank. "
Eagle Scout. Idealist. Drug Trafficker?,"Ross Ulbricht's last moments as a free man were noisy enough to draw a crowd. Employees at the Glen Park branch of the San Francisco library heard a crashing sound and rushed to the science fiction section, expecting to find a patron had hit the floor. Instead, they found a handful of federal agents surrounding a slender 29-year-old man with light brown hair and wearing a T-shirt and jeans. The goal of the arrest, at 3:15 p.m. on Oct. 1, 2013, was not simply to apprehend Mr. Ulbricht, but also to prevent him from performing the most mundane of tasks: closing his laptop. That computer, according to the F.B.I., was the command center of Silk Road, the world's largest and most notorious black market for drugs. In just two and a half years, the government says, Silk Road had become a hub for more than $1.2 billion worth of transactions, many of them in cocaine, heroin and LSD.  The site was like an eBay for the illicit, celebrated by drug enthusiasts, denounced by United States senators and stalked by four federal agencies. But because it was run on Tor, an encrypted Internet network, and because it merely connected buyers and sellers -- rather than warehousing any products -- it seemed to operate in a vaporous cloud. It was a business without infrastructure, other than a few servers and that laptop, which on 3:14 that October afternoon sat on a library desk, open. Had Mr. Ulbricht seen the F.B.I. coming, and simply closed the laptop, password protections probably would have kicked in, turning the hard drive into what Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute, called ''an encrypted lump'' that would have been ''tougher to break into than Fort Knox.'' Whatever tactics were used -- the F.B.I. would not comment -- they worked. Mr. Ulbricht was administering Silk Road when he was grabbed, the bureau said in a criminal complaint, and working under an alias, Dread Pirate Roberts, the name of a swashbuckling character from the novel and film ''The Princess Bride.'' The government later released screen photographs showing that Mr. Ulbricht was logged into a page titled ''mastermind.'' According to the government, operational files were found, including ledgers that tallied personal revenue of 600,000 Bitcoins, the crypto-currency used for every Silk Road transaction, a stash that, at the time, was worth $80 million. A criminal complaint laid out the charges, which included narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. An indictment in a parallel but separate investigation, run out of Baltimore, included this startling detail: Some of Dread Pirate Roberts's booty was spent to commission killings -- six killings in total, to be done by hit men whose targets were deemed by Dread Pirate Roberts to threaten Silk Road. None of the orders resulted in actual deaths, the authorities said. One, in fact, was an elaborate fiction concocted by a federal agent posing as a drug dealer. In a scene that sounds as if it were lifted from ''Breaking Bad,'' federal agents traveled to Utah to fake a beating and execution, sending the evidently grisly photographs to D.P.R., as the government calls him in its complaint. ''What's done is done,'' D.P.R. would later write to the putative dealer. News of Mr. Ulbricht's arrest, and the particulars of the crimes with which he was charged, elicited the inevitable chorus of ''They've got the wrong guy'' from friends and relatives, an almost clichéd feature of double-life cases. But this chorus was different. Sure, Mr. Ulbricht took his share of drugs growing up in Austin, Tex. And a high school buddy, Thomas Haney, said he could sort of imagine Ross buying from Silk Road. But running it? Ordering killings? No way. ''It'd be like they accused my mother of trying to kill someone,'' said Mr. Haney, who now lives in Boise, Idaho. ''He's one of the most guileless and nonaggressive people I've ever met.'' A man who shared a house with Mr. Ulbricht in San Francisco for two months remembers how he rushed to help an elderly homeless woman in a wheelchair. ''We were standing outside a restaurant, and he just handed me the leash to my dogs, ran into the street and said, 'Can I help you?' '' said the man, who, like many people interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want his name in an article about this case. ''And he didn't wait for an answer.'' Far from the bloodless kingpin portrayed by the government, Ross Ulbricht, by the accounts of friends and relatives, was soulful and sensitive. In a conversation with his childhood friend Rene Pinnell, recorded in 2012 through StoryCorps, a national oral history project, and still posted on YouTube, Mr. Ulbricht said that in college he initially refused to sleep with the woman he described as his first love, for fear that he would wind up heartsick. ''We didn't have sex for like three months,'' he said. ''But we'd make out, and really, like, get close but never go there. And when we finally did, it was amazing.'' It seems nearly impossible to reconcile the government's version of Mr. Ulbricht with the warm, compassionate person that others describe. Which leaves at least three possibilities. One, that the government has, in fact, collared the wrong man. Two, that Mr. Ulbricht is a sociopath who concealed a dark side from everyone for years. Three, that Mr. Ulbricht is Dread Pirate Roberts -- and that the two are not really that different. A Trusted Emporium By relying on Bitcoin and an encrypted Internet network, Silk Road created an anonymous bazaar where drugs could be bought from the comfort of home. No more drives to seedy parts of town, no more face-to-face encounters with shady dealers. Instead, transactions would be conducted through the mail, and, in what many academics regard as the linchpin to the business-model innovation, Dread Pirate Roberts devised a system to ensure that nobody got fleeced. The site acted as an intermediary, hosting the online market and holding money in escrow until buyers confirmed that products had arrived. D.P.R. would then release the payment to the seller, keeping 8 to 15 percent of the transaction. ''He had basically commoditized security,'' says Nicolas Christin, an assistant research professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has studied Silk Road. ''It was a system that allowed people to buy drugs without fear that they would be ripped off.'' Within months of its start in January 2011, the site was thriving. Sellers posted photographs and descriptions of their products, like ''10 x 10mg OxyContin'' and ''5G Pure Cocaine Cristal.'' A guide offered tips for newcomers. Vacuum-sealed packages were recommended for anyone mailing narcotics to avoid detection by ''canine or electronic sniffers,'' and post office boxes were urged for buyers. Reviews were posted, just like on eBay. ''Perfect stealth and perfect dope to match,'' gushed a customer of a merchant known as ''gotsitall,'' who sold what was billed as high-quality heroin. ''Got product in less than 24 hours! Thanks again.'' A small staff was hired to respond to users and settle disputes. These employees, none of whom knew the identity of Dread Pirate Roberts, were paid between $1,000 and $2,000 a week in Bitcoins. By June 2011, the site was attracting enough buzz to merit a post on Gawker, which called it ''the underground website where you can buy any drug imaginable.'' Soon, Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia were demanding that the Justice Department close Silk Road. But the site had only begun to catch on. An inventory taken by the F.B.I. one day last September found 13,000 listings for controlled substances, in categories that included opioids, psychedelics and ecstasy. A ''services'' section with 159 offerings included a tutorial on hacking automated teller machines. More than 800 listings offered ''digital goods,'' such as hacked Netflix accounts, and 169 listings in ''forgeries,'' including driver's licenses and car insurance records. Anyone with minimal computer literacy could access this superstore of criminal mischief. Users needed only to install software for Tor, a network that hides I.P. addresses and bundles communications in layers of encryption. Type in Silk Road's ungainly address, silkroadvb5piz3r.onion, and you entered the market. Acquire Bitcoins, through exchanges such as Mt.Gox, and you could start shopping. 'Execute Rather Than Torture' The system made D.P.R. a cybermultimillionaire. But accumulating that wealth came with its share of management migraines. One of the biggest involved an employee named Curtis Clark Green, a burly man whose colorful past includes a stint as a semipro poker player and charges of prescription fraud. From his home in Spanish Fork, Utah, the government said, he sold drugs on Silk Road under the name ''chronicpain,'' and eventually he built enough trust with D.P.R. to become one of his lieutenants. In early December 2012, D.P.R. needed Mr. Green for a special task. A dealer who operated under the alias ''nob'' had complained that Silk Road transactions were too small to be worth his time. Mr. Green was to find someone willing to play in the same league. ''Hey, I think we have a buyer for you,'' D.P.R. subsequently wrote to nob. ''One of my staff is sending details.'' Nob, however, was not a dealer. He was a member of Operation Marco Polo, a task force based in Baltimore that was named for the explorer who followed the Silk Road and that included agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and Homeland Security Investigations. (No one from any of the investigating agencies would comment on the case.) When Mr. Green helped nob arrange the sale of a kilogram of cocaine, in early 2012, he did something that is hard to explain: he offered to act as a conduit and have the cocaine sent to his house. Mr. Green was soon arrested. He was quickly released and the kilogram was sent, as planned, to the buyer, presumably to prevent D.P.R. from realizing that one of his underlings had been caught. Dread Pirate Roberts did somehow learn of the arrest, but he still didn't realize he was communicating with a federal agent who had arranged it. He was soon fuming to nob that Mr. Green had absconded with Bitcoins, and D.P.R. asked for help. ''I'd like him beat up, then forced to send the Bitcoins he stole back,'' D.P.R. wrote. ''Like sit him down at his computer and make him do it.'' Soon, D.P.R. had a change of heart. ''Can you change the order to execute rather than torture?'' he asked nob, explaining, ''I'm afraid he'll give up info.'' Nob told D.P.R. that he knew ''pros'' who could get the job done. The cost was $40,000 in Bitcoins up front, and $40,000 after the killing. Dread Pirate Roberts agreed to the price but wanted ''proof of death,'' asking nob to instruct the killers to send a video, ''and if they can't do that, then pictures'' of the deceased. Only the broad outlines are known of what must have been a highly cinematic dumb show of violence. What is clear from the criminal complaint is that by Feb. 21, nob sent photos of Mr. Green doing a fine impression of a corpse. Mr. Green had ''died of asphyxiation/heart rupture'' while being tortured, nob explained. Dread Pirate Roberts replied that he found the images disturbing, but that he did not have any other choice. ''I just wish more people had some integrity,'' D.P.R. wrote. In the months that followed, D.P.R. would pay a supposed hit man named ''redandwhite'' $150,000 in Bitcoins to whack a blackmailer who was threatening to release the identities of Silk Road users, and later a seller who appears to have scammed buyers en masse. When redandwhite noted that the scammer lived with three roommates, D.P.R. was persuaded to kill all four of them, at a cost of $500,000. The government contends that the whole enterprise was likely a swindle. Whether these targets were in cahoots with redandwhite, or were the creation of redandwhite, is not clear. But authorities in Canada, where all five killings were supposed to have taken place, found no trace of crimes that matched redandwhite's descriptions, according to federal prosecutors. Nonetheless, D.P.R.'s willingness to underwrite killings would become an argument against bail, which was presented in November by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, where Ross Ulbricht was transferred soon after his arrest. (The F.B.I. ran its case out of Manhattan.) Today, Mr. Ulbricht awaits trial in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The Forgiving Kind Lyn Ulbricht, Mr. Ulbricht's mother, sat one recent morning in the downtown Manhattan office of her son's lawyer. She had flown in from Austin a few days earlier, to look for a place where she and her husband could live to be close to their son. ''I can't be somewhere else while he's in jail,'' she said. ''We want to visit him. We believe in him, so that's what we're going to do.'' Ross Ulbricht grew up in a suburb of Austin that his mother described as the poorest neighborhood in a good school district. She and her husband, Kirk, earn most of their income renting four beachside vacation houses they own in Costa Rica. Ross is remembered by friends as bright, though not whiz-kid bright, part of a circle that mostly avoided the football culture that dominated high school. ''He was outdoorsy,'' said James McFarland, who met Mr. Ulbricht in a physics class. ''We played a lot of ultimate Frisbee, hiking, swimming, that sort of thing.'' Mr. McFarland and others say he was shy around girls, sweet-natured, loyal to friends and a fan of intense philosophical conversations. He was also an unusual combination of rule follower and rule breaker. He did a lot of drugs, as he explained in that StoryCorps conversation, likening his intake to a guy who jumped into the deep end of a pool and stayed underwater for as long as he could hold his breath. At the same time, he collected enough merit badges to become that emblem of teenage all-Americanness, an Eagle Scout. By the time he went to the University of Texas at Dallas, on a full academic scholarship, he was 6-foot-2, a lean, good-looking guy who could have fronted an indie rock band. But he was the opposite of a Lothario. He was vulnerable and eager to find a soul mate, and fell hard for that college girlfriend. The two were engaged, according to Thomas Haney, but it ended when Ross learned that she had cheated with one of his closest buddies. ''I'd have killed the guy, but Ross completely forgave him within a year of it happening,'' Mr. Haney said. That was Ross's style, not just willing to forgive, but empathetic to the point of mushy. At a bachelor party held in the woods two years ago for a friend named Daniel, Mr. Haney said, everyone was sitting around, kind of stumped about what to do. ''Then Ross pipes up,'' Mr. Haney said, ''and he said, 'Let's go around in a circle and say why we love Daniel.' '' After graduating in 2006 with a degree in physics, Mr. Ulbricht headed to Penn State, where he earned a master's degree in material sciences and engineering. His thesis, ''Growth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy,'' is still available at the school's online archives. He later returned to Austin and was a co-founder of Good Wagon Books, which collected used books from around the city and sold them online, donating 10 percent of profits to charities. But the venture failed, and Mr. Ulbricht started what he described to acquaintances as a hedge fund, trading stocks and currencies, including Bitcoin. Friends had the impression that it was not going well, especially after other people started to give him money to invest, which made him overly cautious. At the invitation of Mr. Pinnell, Mr. Ulbricht relocated to San Francisco in 2012. When Mr. Pinnell became engaged, Mr. Ulbricht moved into a group house, where he told roommates that his name was Joshua Terrey, according to an article in Forbes. In August, two months before he was arrested, he abruptly left that house for another, without explanation. His new accommodations were hardly those of a drug lord. He paid $1,100 a month for a 12-by-14-foot room, sharing a house with three roommates. One of those roommates said that they knew him by his real name and that he told them he earned a living by building and managing websites. Nothing about him seemed out of the ordinary, until he was arrested. That day, his roommates returned to their house to find a search warrant left by the F.B.I. on the coffee table in the living room. ''The F.B.I. came back a bunch of times and asked questions for hours,'' the roommate said. ''We were in shock. It really was about a week before I felt normal.'' Nine Fake IDs How did the F.B.I. connect Dread Pirate Roberts to Ross Ulbricht? That is still a mystery. Mr. Ulbricht certainly left more than a few digital crumbs, according to the government's complaint and a variety of online rubberneckers who followed the case. The first mention of Silk Road online, in January 2011, by someone called ''altoid,'' was followed a few months later by a user with the same alias on a Bitcoin Talk forum. This person was searching for an I.T. pro for hire. Applicants were asked to email ''rossulbricht at gmail dot com.'' But this was only enough to make Mr. Ulbricht a person of interest. In July 2013, Customs and Border Protection intercepted a package from Canada bound for his address. The package contained nine fake IDs, each bearing a photograph of Mr. Ulbricht and a different name, with addresses in a variety of states and countries. On July 26, agents of Homeland Security Investigations knocked on the door of Mr. Ulbricht's group house. ''Josh,'' as he then was calling himself, refused to answer most of the agents' questions, the government would say later. Though Mr. Ulbricht did not take the opportunity to skedaddle, he apparently had considered it. The government would say later that his laptop contained a filled-out application for ''economic citizenship'' in Dominica, a Caribbean island. The price was a one-time donation of $75,000 to the country's government. The crucial breakthrough in the case occurred a few weeks after that fake ID package was intercepted. The F.B.I. located and copied the contents of Silk Road's main servers, the computers that powered the site's operations and stored its data. It is here that the government's otherwise detailed account gets fuzzy. The F.B.I. has stated only that the main server was found in ''a certain foreign country,'' one that has a mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States. Through the treaty, the F.B.I. was given a copy of the server -- a ''mirror'' of it, in tech terms -- on July 23. The site continued to operate, so D.P.R. would not be spooked. What is unclear is how the feds knew where the servers were. Presumably, they were rented in some faraway corners of the globe -- Iceland, Latvia and Romania are likely, according to experts who have studied the I.P. addresses. But the official vagueness has provoked speculation in academic circles and among security specialists. Was the National Security Agency involved? Did this process involve breaking laws, or violating constitutional rights? That issue will be at the heart of Ross Ulbricht's defense strategy, says Joshua L. Dratel, his lawyer, whose clients include a Guantánamo detainee.''It's called the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine,'' Mr. Dratel explained. ''If you think of the acquisitions of evidence as a chain, if you find one bad link, everything on the other side of that link is suppressible.'' In other words, if Mr. Dratel can prove that the government acted improperly when it found and copied that server, all the evidence it gathered after that -- including the laptop taken in that Oct. 1 arrest -- could be tossed out of court. Mr. Dratel said he would also argue that Mr. Ulbricht is not Dread Pirate Roberts. But that contention could be hard to square with a sworn statement by Mr. Ulbricht, filed with the court Dec. 12. It says the Bitcoins seized from the laptop should be returned to him, because he ''has an interest as an owner/possessor'' of the money. This seems a tricky needle for Mr. Ulbricht to thread. He is denying that he is Dread Pirate Roberts but demanding what the government maintains is D.P.R.'s money. How did Mr. Ulbricht earn millions in virtual dollars, if not through Silk Road commissions? Mr. Dratel declined to say, citing a reluctance to discuss the facts of the case. 'A Revolution of Epic Proportions' The 2012 StoryCorps video ends with Rene Pinnell asking where Mr. Ulbricht hopes to be in 20 years. ''Twenty years, uh,'' says Mr. Ulbricht, tugging at his facial hair and looking sideways. After a pause, he looks directly at Mr. Pinnell and says, ''I want to have had a substantial positive impact on the future of humanity by that time.'' Mr. Pinnell laughs, because that sounds so ambitious that it initially comes across as a joke. But Mr. Ulbricht isn't laughing. ''Do you think you're going to live forever?'' Mr. Pinnell asks, getting serious. ''I think it's a possibility,'' says Mr. Ulbricht, allowing a grin. Again, his friend chuckles. ''I honestly do,'' Mr. Ulbricht says with a smile. ''I think I might live forever in some form, by that time. I mean technology is changing so fast.'' Mr. Pinnell does not pose the obvious follow-up -- what are you talking about? How exactly do you plan to transition from day trader-with-a-laptop to historical figure? None of Mr. Ulbricht's friends, it seems, had an answer for that one, perhaps because they didn't know enough about his interior life. Most grasped that he'd long been a searcher, a restless mind rummaging around for a philosophy. For years, he was fascinated by Eastern mysticism, and briefly was an advocate of the Landmark Forum, a three-day seminar intended to give participants ''the power to make what you're committed to into a reality,'' as the company's website says. What few friends realized is where his philosophical quest had brought him. At Penn State, he was becoming a dedicated libertarian. He joined the school's Libertarian Club and wore a Ron Paul for President shirt to classes. Mr. Ulbricht was quoted in the school's newspaper, The Daily Collegian, saying of Mr. Paul, ''there's a lot to learn from him and his message of what it means to be a U.S. citizen and what it means to be a free individual.'' By the time Mr. Ulbricht left Penn State, his views had taken on a vehemently anti-tax tone. A friend in Austin said Mr. Ulbricht's politics at the time were more ''hard core'' than his own. ''I'd say 'Less government but we need the government to build roads,' '' this friend said. ''But for him, even when it came to building roads, he felt there ought to be a voluntary basis for that. The point for him wasn't to abolish government. He just thought people should have the ability to opt out of paying taxes.'' These views weren't a secret. Not long after graduating from Penn State, he wrote on his LinkedIn page that his interest in physics had waned. ''Now, my goals have shifted,'' he wrote. ''I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind.'' Institutions and government were the problem, he continued. Which is why he was ''creating an economic simulation to give people a firsthand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.'' Was Silk Road that economic simulation? Without question, Dread Pirate Roberts considered the site a means to ''abolish the use of coercion.'' He routinely proclaimed so, in postings that sound like a mash-up of manifesto and infomercial. ''I walk tall, proud and free, knowing that the actions I take eat away at the infrastructure that keeps oppression alive,'' D.P.R. wrote on Silk Road in March 2012. ''Now it is profitable to throw off one's chains, with amazing crypto technology reducing the risk of doing so dramatically. How many niches have yet to be filled in the world of anonymous online markets? The opportunity to prosper and take part in a revolution of epic proportions is at our fingertips!'' Dread Pirate Roberts considered his work epochal because he was not just promoting the sale of illicit goods. He was reimagining the fundamentals of commerce. For centuries, consumers have been taxed by governments or overlords of one type or another, rendering unto Caesar for as long as there have been Caesars. But if Silk Road were scalable, that era was over. Or at least imperiled. Anyone would have the option to sell goods undisturbed by regulations and without sharing a percentage of revenue with the state. And why stop at drugs? The system would work for legal products, too. The tools are there for a kind of subterranean Amazon.com. ''It could literally change the world as we know it,'' D.P.R. wrote of Silk Road in an online exhortation. A man who created a website that changed the world as we know it could believe he had a chance to live forever. At minimum, he could be a hero to anyone who thinks that government has no business in business. Ross Ulbricht and Dread Pirate Roberts have other similarities, including a fondness for the Ludwig von Mises Institute, part of the Austrian School of Economics, which was celebrated by Mr. Ulbricht on his Google+ page and by D.P.R. in Silk Road pep talks. This could be a coincidence. It could also be a coincidence that neither man nor pseudonym seemed motivated by greed. Mr. Ulbricht's lifestyle was one notch above that of urban couch surfer. And the primary goal that D.P.R. professed was to unshackle humanity from what he regarded as economic tyranny. If a handful of miscreants -- and yes, a few of their unfortunate roommates -- were killed along the way, that is a shame. But Silk Road was like a tunnel under the gulag, and D.P.R. was digging for the sake of humanity. ''It needs everything we have,'' D.P.R. wrote of Silk Road, urging buyers and sellers to grasp its significance. ''Do it for me, do it for yourself, do it for your families and friends, and do it for mankind.'' Perhaps this is where Dread Pirate Roberts, the criminal mastermind, overlaps with Ross Ulbricht, the guy who aided a homeless woman in a wheelchair. With aching sincerity, they both really wanted to help. Roads Closed? The success of Silk Road raised the prospect that the thuggish street drug dealer, the stock character of countless police procedurals, could be replaced by a geek in a coffee shop with a laptop. But in the months since Silk Road was shut down, several sites have tried to takes its place and all have failed. One of them, called the Sheep Marketplace, went dark in December, as users howled that administrators had made off with as much as $44 million in Bitcoins. Project: Black Flag lasted a few weeks in October, before its leader announced, ''I was unable to cope with the stress and constant demand, so I panicked.'' Metta Dread Pirate Roberts, as that site's fearful leader was known, then absconded with an unknown sum of Bitcoins, according to news reports. ''I suspect that the online drug marketplace is a passing fad because it's too traceable, too vulnerable to hacking,'' said Mr. Weaver at the International Computer Science Institute. Once Bitcoins are converted to another currency, the government can subpoena the records of the exchange where the transaction took place and harvest all the information it needs. ''Bitcoin isn't really a 'coin' as much as a distributed, public balance ledger,'' Mr. Weaver added, ''with every balance and transaction recorded.'' Hence Bitcoin's wry new nickname in legal circles: ''Prosecution Futures.'' The government has begun making arrests: Olivia Bolles, a Delaware doctor, was charged in November with selling oxycodone, Xanax and other drugs on Silk Road, stuffing Sour Patch and Jolly Rancher candy in the packages to thwart detection. But the limits of technology are only part of the reason that another Silk Road is unlikely anytime soon. To function, such a site needs a leader who is dedicated to the point of fanaticism, and, more important, has a strange kind of integrity. Dread Pirate Roberts did not take the Bitcoin and run because he was a true believer first and an outlaw second. He was a rare set of contradictions, a humanitarian willing to kill, a criminal with a strict code of ethics. "
Bitcoin Rules,"TOKYO -- Japan is drawing up a plan to regulate Bitcoin, officials said on Wednesday, including clauses the Nikkei business daily said would tax Bitcoin transactions and ban banks and securities firms from handling the digital currency.  The guidelines, which clarify how Bitcoin should be dealt with under Japanese law, come after the collapse of a prominent Bitcoin exchange last week. An opposition lawmaker had petitioned the government to clear up, among other issues, whether Bitcoin should be treated as a currency. Treating them as a currency could strengthen the case for regulation under more stringent banking or other laws. The Japanese government seems to be leaning toward treating Bitcoin as a general commodity, the Nikkei said. Any gains from trading Bitcoin in Japan are to be subject to local taxes, together with any purchases made with Bitcoin, the paper said. For companies, revenue from Bitcoin transactions would also be taxed. The guidelines being drafted would also bar banks and securities firms from handling Bitcoin, the Nikkei said. Japan's top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said that talks on Bitcoin guidelines were in progress but that details had not been set. A spokesman at Japan's Financial Services Agency also said guidelines were being drawn up. ''Various government agencies are doing their best to put the guidelines together,'' Mr. Suga said. The government is required by Sunday to address a petition lodged by Tsutomu Okubo, a lawmaker in the opposition Democratic Party and a former managing director at Morgan Stanley. Mr. Okubo filed an open letter last week in Parliament, urging officials to clarify their stance on Bitcoin regulation. Nations have been grappling with how to regulate Bitcoin, a popular virtual currency traded on the web, free of central control. United States regulators have shown interest in setting ground rules for it. The regulatory scrutiny has come amid hacking attacks and scandals that have cast doubt on Bitcoin's potential to become an alternative to fiat money. Flexcoin, an online bank specializing in Bitcoin, said on Tuesday that it was closing after hackers plundered its digital currency reserves. That heist totaled about $600,000 at the current average market price. In Japan, action has in part been prompted by the collapse of Mt. Gox, long a dominant trading platform for Bitcoin based in Tokyo. Mt. Gox abruptly halted all trading and filed for bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost half a billion dollars' worth of Bitcoins, leaving hundreds of thousands of users in the lurch. The proposed guidelines, however, could ease fears that had arisen among some technology start-ups that the Mt. Gox debacle, together with a string of other hacking attacks and scandals, would bring heavy regulations that would force small operators out. But by banning banks and brokerage firms from handling Bitcoin, Japan's proposed regulations appear to swing in the opposite direction. Karl-Friedrich Lenz, a law professor at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo, said that although the proposed guidelines would bring some welcome clarification, they could also leave Bitcoin trading to untested upstarts, with little additional protections for users. ''If banks and securities firms can't handle Bitcoins, Japanese consumers will be stuck with illegal shadow banks like Mt. Gox, and their risk will be much higher as a result,'' he said in a note. Colin Moreshead and Makiko Inoue contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
International Raids Target Sites Selling Contraband on the 'Dark Web',"In the digital marketplace, they operated as a secret underground with names like Blue Sky and Silk Road 2.0 where anonymous buyers could purchase drugs, stolen credit cards and weapons, or even hire a hit man. These websites, known as the ''dark web,'' cannot be found by Google or even by typing in a web address. The sites typically operated on the Tor network, which is designed to conceal the I.P. addresses of the computers being used. It was that thriving online black market that American and international authorities announced on Friday had been the target of a series of raids and arrests in 16 countries, which included the seizure of dozens of websites that matched anonymous sellers and buyers for illicit goods and services.  The investigation, nicknamed Operation Onymous, was aimed chiefly at sellers, and deactivated upward of 50 such websites, including Silk Road 2.0 and Blue Sky, as well as Mr. Quid's Forum and Cannabis Road Markets, according to Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency. Across Europe and the United States, at least 17 sellers were arrested, and law enforcement authorities seized Bitcoins valued at $1 million, along with gold, cash and drugs, according to Troels Oerting, who heads Europol's cybercrime center. The investigation had been underway for months as the illegal online market ''mushroomed,'' Mr. Oerting said. The international effort was ''the largest law enforcement action to date against criminal websites operating on the Tor network,'' said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose office announced the operation on Friday. ''As illegal activity online becomes more prevalent,'' he added, ''criminals can no longer expect that they can hide in the shadows of the 'dark web.' '' On Thursday, Mr. Bharara's office announced charges against a California man, Blake Benthall, 26, who was arrested the previous day in San Francisco and charged with narcotics trafficking, money laundering and hacking conspiracies in connection with his operation of Silk Road 2.0. That site, the authorities said, was the successor to the original Silk Road website and identical in operation. As recently as Oct. 29, Silk Road 2.0 was ''dominated by offerings for illegal narcotics,'' with 14,024 listings for ''Drugs,'' including 1,654 for ''Psychedelics'' and 1,921 for ''Ecstasy,'' according to a federal complaint. The website recently had about 150,000 monthly active users, generating at least $8 million in monthly sales and $400,000 in monthly commissions, the authorities said. The operation was led by American law enforcement agencies -- the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations -- and coordinated by Europol in the various European countries. The raids started on Wednesday, with Mr. Benthall's arrest, and continued through Friday in a broad sweep. Raids took place across Europe, including France, Germany, Spain, Britain and Ireland. Mr. Bharara's office cited the cooperation of those countries, as well as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden and Switzerland. Mr. Oerting declined to say how the authorities had cracked the dark websites despite the sites' use of anonymous software. But the investigation appears to have been full of intrigue. An undercover Homeland Security agent ''successfully infiltrated the support staff involved in running'' Silk Road 2.0, was provided access to its private areas and ''regularly interacted directly'' with Mr. Benthall, who used the screen name Defcon, according to the complaint, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan. The agent even became a paid staff member of Silk Road 2.0, and since January received regular payments in Bitcoins totaling about $32,000, according to the complaint. The Tor browser, originally developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, is an open source project that permits people to use the Internet without revealing their location. It is used not only for criminal activities but by whistle-blowers and activists seeking to avoid detection. Users of Tor, an acronym for the onion router for its layers of encryption, need special software. Mr. Bharara's office said Friday that the broad operation against the ''dark market'' sites involved the seizure of more than 400 Tor web addresses and the servers hosting them. The targeted websites included some designed to mimic conventional online retail giants, even down to offering a system to review and rate the quality of service. ''The business model is to create web stores on these hidden services and then use the normal transport to deliver it,'' Mr. Oerting said. Among the sites seized was one called ''Executive Outcomes,'' which specialized in the trafficking of firearms, including assault rifles, automatic weapons and sound suppressors, Mr. Bharara's office said. The office said that the site offered ''secure drop ship locations'' globally to ensure anonymity during the shipping process. Another website, ''Fake Real Plastic,'' offered counterfeit credit cards for sale, ''printed to look just like real Visa and MasterCards,'' according to Mr. Bharara's office. The site guaranteed that its cards would have at least $2,500 left on the credit card limit and could be produced with ''any name you want on the card,'' the government said. Other sites had offered to sell counterfeit euros and dollars in exchange for Bitcoins, prosecutors said. ''The scope is basically everything is for sale, everything that is stolen,'' Mr. Oerting said. ''You might even buy a stolen car. But in general they were selling anything you would want to send with a normal mailman, the fastest business mode,'' he said. "
Mt. Gox Files for Bankruptcy,"TOKYO - Mt. Gox, the troubled exchange for the virtual currency Bitcoin, filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday and said that it might have lost all of its customers' coins in a hacking attack.  The Tokyo-based exchange, which warned earlier this month of a software flaw that may have allowed hackers to defraud it of Bitcoins, had halted all trading earlier this week. Mark Karpeles, the company's chief executive, wearing a suit instead of his usual T-shirt, bowed in contrition and apologized in Japanese at a press conference in Tokyo. ""I'm truly sorry to have caused inconvenience,"" he said. The exchange has likely lost 800,000 Bitcoins, according to a person briefed on its holdings soon before the exchange went offline on Tuesday. Mt. Gox had said on its website on Wednesday that it was still ""working very hard"" toward a resolution. Investors in the exchange had said they did not expect to recover their money stashed on the Mt. Gox platform, which once accounted for four-fifths of the world's Bitcoin trading.  But Mt. Gox's bankruptcy, filed under Japan's Civil Rehabilitation Law, which is similar to Chapter 11 in the United States, will mean that a bankruptcy supervisor is set to develop a restructuring plan, and will also be responsible for handling any payment of claim distributions to its creditors. That process could take form several months to several years. The exchange has liabilities of 6.5 billion yen, or $64 million, compared with total assets of 3.84 billion yen, the company said. It has 127,000 creditors. "
Fake App Eavesdrops on Hong Kong Protesters' Phones,"HONG KONG -- As tens of thousands of protesters in Hong Kong continued to shut down the city's main arteries on Wednesday in a call for democracy, a quieter struggle was playing out to monitor the demonstrations online. The most recent salvo came to light on Tuesday, when Lacoon Mobile Security said that it had tracked the spread of a fake mobile application aimed at eavesdropping on protesters' communications. In what is known as a phishing attack, smartphone users in Hong Kong have been receiving a link on WhatsApp to download the software, along with a note: ''Check out this Android app designed by Code4HK for the coordination of OCCUPY CENTRAL!''  Code4HK, a community of programmers who have been working to support the democracy movement, had nothing to do with the application, according to Lacoon. Though Michael Shaulov, Lacoon's chief executive, said it was impossible to be certain about the origin of the fake app, he said signs pointed to the Chinese government. Given the ''targets of the operation, where the servers are based and the sophistication of the attack, it doesn't leave much room to the imagination.'' After users download the application, it has the ability to gain access to personal data like passwords and bank information, spy on phone calls and messages and track the physical location of the infected smartphone. It is unclear how many smartphones in Hong Kong have been hit, but in similar attacks in the past, one in 10 phones that received such a message became infected, according to Mr. Shaulov. ''These really cheap social engineering tricks; they have a high rate of success,'' he said. What makes the malicious app stand out is a version that can infect Apple iOS devices, though only those that have been ''jailbroken,'' or altered in a way that allows them to download software not available in the official Apple App Store. ''This is the first time that we have seen such operationally sophisticated iOS malware operational, which is actually developed by a Chinese-speaking entity,'' Mr. Shaulov said. Mr. Shaulov's company traced the fake app to a computer that closely resembled those scrutinized by Mandiant, an American security firm that published a 60-page study last year that linked hacking attacks on American companies to the Chinese military. It's not the first time the democracy movement in Hong Kong has drawn sophisticated web attacks. In June, an unofficial referendum on Hong Kong's political future that allowed people in Hong Kong to vote online drew one of the largest denial-of-service attacks in history, according to Matthew Prince, the chief executive of CloudFlare, which helped defend the referendum site from the attack. Such attacks are aimed at overwhelming a site with online traffic, causing it to shut down. The recent targeting of the protests in Hong Kong has been part of a sustained campaign -- most likely carried out by Chiense intelligence -- dating back to about a year ago, according to Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and chief technology officer of the security firm CrowdStrike. He said he expected cyberattacks to monitor and potentially discredit protest leaders to increase in the coming weeks. ''We expect to see a more aggressive tempo by the Chinese, he said, ''to try to spread disinformation, to try to compromise individuals that are involved from a public relations perspective.'' Though it is hard to prove, Mr. Alperovitch said he believed the targeting of the protesters is the work of China's Ministry of State Security, which is usually charged with tracking dissidents and others deemed a threat to stability in China. Tactics employed against Occupy Central, one of the groups protesting in Hong Kong, are similar to those used by the Ministry of State Security within China on minority groups from Tibet and Xinjiang provinces, he said. One possibility is in that coming weeks the government could leak phone calls or even disinformation in an effort to discredit protest leaders or link them to foreign governments, according to Mr. Alperovitch. China often attributes unrest to agitation by foreign powers. ''We've seen in the Russia-Ukrainian conflict, phone calls have been released. I wouldn't be surprised if the Chinese steal the Russian playbook and adopt some of those same tactics,'' he said. Protesters in the current demonstrations in Hong Kong are making use of a new app that allows them to send messages without a cellular or Internet connection. Introduced in March, FireChat makes use of a cellphone's radio and Bluetooth communications to create a network of phones close to one another -- up to about 80 yards. Though downloaded widely by the Hong Kong protesters after rumors spread that the Internet would be cut, many have been making use of the app in areas where crowds have overwhelmed the cellphone system. Other technological help has come from Code4HK, the programmers' group. Its website provides links to live video feeds of the demonstrations, offers updated Google maps showing where supply and medical stations are in protest areas, and maintains an open spreadsheet that shows what supplies are needed. Within China, the cat-and-mouse game that often goes on between politically minded Internet users and the government's censors continued. Since Saturday, the Facebook-owned Instagram service has been widely inaccessible, according to users and several Internet monitors, leading commentators to speculate that the government had closed access to the app to stanch the flow of images of the protests. The rate of deletions of posts on China's version of Twitter, Weibo, has also soared in recent days, an indication of how concerned the government is that news of the protests might spread unrest to China, according to Fu King-wa, a professor of media studies at Hong Kong University. Despite the spike in deletions, David Bandurski, a researcher at the University of Hong Kong, said that the huge flow of posts and the reliance on humans to individually censor content meant that some posts were getting through. Possibly more so than on newer products like Tencent's mobile messaging app WeChat, which he said showed more efficiency in blocking posts from its social network. Beneath one post from a Chinese journalist on Weibo, Mr. Bandurski said he saw ''page after page of comments.'' ''It had become a public online square for people talking about what's happening in Hong Kong,'' he said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Cyberattack on Hong Kong Vote Was Among Largest Ever, Security Chief Says","The online voting platform for the unofficial referendum now underway on Hong Kong's political future has been subjected to one of the most severe cyberattacks of its kind ever seen, according to the head of the Internet security company tasked with protecting it. Matthew Prince, chief executive and co-founder of the San Francisco-based company CloudFlare, said in an email Friday that the distributed denial-of-service attack (also known as DDoS) on Occupy Central's voting platform was ""one of the largest and most persistent"" ever.     Mr. Prince said the attackers appeared to have commanded a network of compromised computers around the world to overwhelm the platform with traffic in hopes of disabling it.  The owners of the computers exploited in such attacks are usually unaware that they have been compromised. Despite minor hiccups in the voting system, apparently caused by the denial-of-service attack, by Saturday it had recorded more than half a million votes in less than 30 hours, in a city with a population of 7.2 million.  Voting in the unofficial referendum, which asks permanent residents of Hong Kong to choose one of three methods for nominating candidates for chief executive, is to continue until June 29. On Friday, the first day of voting, Beijing denounced the referendum as ""illegal and invalid."" Hong Kong's chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, said none of the three proposals complied with Hong Kong's Basic Law, the territory's de facto constitution.  All three plans would allow candidates to get onto the ballot by collecting enough signatures, which would mean the Chinese government could not screen candidates through allies on a nominating committee. Occupy Central supporters suspect that the central government is behind the attack; opponents have asserted that it is a ploy by the campaign's sympathizers to rally public support.  Mr. Prince said that about 20 percent of the computers used in the attack were from Indonesia, 10 percent from Brazil and the rest from elsewhere.  Indonesia and Brazil are known to have a large number of compromised computers, he said.   China, notably, was not among the 10 countries with the most computers involved, Mr. Prince said.  ""That's actually surprising, and not just for the political reasons that may be motivating this attack, but more because China typically has a very large number of compromised machines,"" he said in the email. While the computers used in the attack could be traced, it was impossible to tell where the ""herder,"" the person directing the attacks, was located, he said. Next Media, which publishes Apple Daily, a Chinese-language Hong Kong newspaper supportive of Occupy Central, was also subjected to a severe cyberattack before the voting began. The polling organization commissioned by Occupy Central to conduct the referendum said Friday that it would increase the number of voting booths to be provided on June 29, the last day of voting.  It also said that a police investigation into the denial-of-service attack had begun.  The mobile application used for voting has become the most popular iPhone app in Hong Kong and the second-most-popular for Android-based devices.  While the initial attacks interrupted much of the online registration process, the actual voting has been smooth. Many supporters of the campaign, including Charles Mok, a legislator representing the information technology sector, have praised CloudFlare for its work. Thank you @eastdakota and @CloudFlare for your support for the democratic aspirations of the people of Hong Kong! - Charles Mok [#x83ab][#x4e43][#x5149] (@charlesmok)20 Jun 14 Responding to his sudden popularity in Hong Kong, Mr. Prince said that he might come to the city during the first week of July.  (A large pro-democracy march is held in Hong Kong each year on July 1, the anniversary of the former British colony's return to Chinese sovereignty.)  He also said he might open the company's first Asian office in Hong Kong instead of Singapore.    Were thinking of opening @CloudFlare's Asian office in Singapore. After all the love tonight, thinking maybe Hong Kong instead. - Matthew Prince (@eastdakota)20 Jun 14 "
Telling Folk Heroes From Monsters,"Woe to the once-hallowed trickster. In ancient mythologies, the riddler-thief and agent of change held a position of prestige. Now, we don't know what to do with him. In our two Americas, we do black and white, either/or, with us or against us. The trickster is in between, both and neither, a character on the fringes. Take Aaron Swartz, the wunderkind programmer who helped lead the successful challenge to the overreaching Stop Online Piracy Act. In 2011, Mr. Swartz was accused of breaking into computer networks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and downloading files from the academic journal hub Jstor. He was arrested on federal charges related to hacking, and was facing up to $1 million in fines and 35 years in prison when he committed suicide at the age of 26. How will he be remembered, and, separately, how should he be remembered? As a revolutionary, a villain or both?  A new documentary, ''The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz'' (being released Friday), posits these questions and others as it tries to deal with the complex figure Mr. Swartz cut online and in real life. With dozens of testimonials from friends, lawyers and colleagues as well as significant video footage of Mr. Swartz himself, the filmmaker Brian Knappenberger aims to create a portrait of a tragic computer prodigy who became a lightning rod for debates about freedom of information, digital security and the function of the web. It is a fraught topic, and a subject all the more fascinating for the Wild Westness of the online space Swartz was helping pioneer. If tricksters are among us, they are probably online, in the digital forest where morally ambiguous ''gray hat'' hackers and bands of pranksters like Anonymous roam as if they were Robin Hood and his Merry Men. In films, at least, the hacker appears as a kind of complicated folk hero. Consider the mercenary bandits in ''Sneakers'' (1992) who thwart a domestic surveillance ploy, only to turn the Holy Grail of code breaking over to the National Security Agency. Following their rebel leader, Martin Bishop (Robert Redford), these ''sneakers'' are a unit of mostly reformed hooligans turned hackers and burglars who contract their services to banks and other secure institutions to reveal just how insecure those clients are. When we meet them, all's fairly right in the sneakers' world, except that Marty has a past and a warrant out for his arrest. So, when two N.S.A. officers stroll into his office with a shady job offer, the lure of amnesty and financial reward is enough to persuade him to commit treason. Though the crew's absolute morality is never entirely in question, it is easy to wonder whether they are breaking codes and laws for the seemingly paltry award or because they can. Of course, code breaking and slipping through gateways is the trickster's forte. Movies have always been a bit awed by the occult magic of computer whizzes, doing whatever it is they do with those letters on a screen, casting and cracking software spells. Sandra Bullock's programmer in ''The Net'' (1995) was deemed so dangerous to the players in a government conspiracy that they allocated what must have been millions of dollars to chase her. But if she was a de facto criminal, it was a corrupted and criminal system that had made her so. And it is only when she is forced outside the law that she can destroy the conspiracy Chimera to reclaim her life. Similarly, Alan Cumming's hacker in ''Goldeneye'' the same year, much like Justin Long's in ''Live Free or Die Hard'' (2007) and Tim Robbins's ersatz Bill Gates in the wretched ''Antitrust'' (2001), had the power both to wreak and to prevent cataclysmic damage. The ne plus ultra of this sort of morally slippery figure may be Julian Assange. In Bill Condon's ''The Fifth Estate'' last year, Mr. Assange is presented as the 21st-century evolution of the truth-first newshound and his WikiLeaks as a sort of cyberfuturistic version of a newsroom. Overbearing to the point of megalomania, this Assange, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, sees himself as a crusader for Good, willing to sacrifice just about everything in its pursuit, and, fitting the classic trickster mold, utterly unaffected by the ripple effects of his actions. Alex Gibney's documentary ''We Steal Secrets,'' a portrait of Mr. Assange, is still more complicated. Some consider this Assange a monster, a threat to state security and maybe even a war criminal. As interactivity has demystified technology, the gamer, the programmer and the hacker have ascended the hierarchy of film archetypes. No longer do we expect an orange-haired Seth Green (''The Italian Job,'' 2003, and ''Enemy of the State,'' 1998) to bang heavily on keys in some remote location while the real hero does heroic stuff elsewhere. Beginning perhaps with ''The Matrix'' (1999), in which a Christlike Neo went digital for our sins and became a eucharistic amalgam of ones and zeros, hackers have been portrayed as heroes with the power to affect the outcome of their lives, and thus their movies. Lisbeth Salander in both versions of ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'' hacks her way out of indentured servitude to her parole officer and then into avenging angel for the ''real'' hero Mikael Blomkvist. And it is a sort of rejected man's revenge that initially motivates the vicious Mark Zuckerberg character in ''The Social Network'' (2010) to design a site that lets him and others cyberevaluate their classmates. Even if hackers like Mr. Swartz are still a problem for us to reconcile in real life, maybe it is in the movies, with their capacity to empathize with the outré, their ability to present difficult, morally prismatic antiheroes, that we can properly come to terms with them. Especially now, in a world so vividly shaped by complex agents of change like Mr. Assange and Edward J. Snowden, we may need movies to help us comprehend our shades of gray. "
Kerry Assures China That the U.S. Can Have Many Allies in Asia,"BEIJING -- Seeking to put the best face on a difficult relationship with Beijing, Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the United States and China could find ways to manage their differences and had more in common than not. Neither side wanted to fall into the ''trap of zero sum competition,'' Mr. Kerry said at the conclusion of an annual strategic and economic dialogue between top officials of the two countries.  The array of topics with some areas of agreement -- climate change, Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan -- attested to the viability of the relationship, he said. Still, Mr. Kerry used fairly blunt language in an effort to persuade President Xi Jinping that the United States did not intend its 60-year system of alliances in Asia to encircle and contain China. ''We mean what we say when we emphasize that there's no U.S. strategy to try to push back against or be in conflict with China,'' he said, as Mr. Xi sat beside him during a farewell session at the Great Hall of the People. Mr. Kerry was indirectly replying to charges by Chinese officials that President Obama had reinvigorated America's network of alliances in Asia with the idea of containing China and its fast modernizing military. In response, Mr. Xi has initiated a campaign that calls for a new security architecture of Asia for the Asians. New accusations that Chinese hackers had attacked highly sensitive American material were brusquely dismissed by China, even as the American delegation, headed by Mr. Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, tried to press cyberespionage as an important issue at the conference. The Foreign Ministry dismissed assertions in an article in The New York Times that Chinese hackers had infiltrated United States government computer systems that house personal information of federal employees. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said the article was part of what he called an irresponsible anti-China smear campaign. The article, first published Wednesday on the newspaper's website, said the hackers had gained access to some of the databases of the Office of Personnel Management before authorities in the United States detected the breach and thwarted further access. It remained unclear what kind of information, if any, was compromised in the attack, which was said to have happened in March. Asked about the article at a regular Foreign Ministry press briefing, a spokesman, Hong Lei, repeated China's longstanding position that it opposes cyberhacking. ''This is what we say and what we have been doing,'' he said. ''Recently, some American media and Internet security firms keep playing the card of China Internet Threat and smear China's image. They cannot produce tenable evidence. Such reports and comments are irresponsible and are not worth refuting.'' Asked about the article at a closing news conference, Mr. Kerry said that he and Mr. Lew had been unaware of the attack described in the article and did not raise it with Chinese officials, although the broader subject of cybersecurity was discussed. ''We were notified about this alleged incident minutes before coming out here,'' Mr. Kerry said. He said the article was about attempted ''intrusions'' that were still being investigated and it did not appear that sensitive material had been compromised. A senior American official who participated in sessions with the Chinese on Thursday said the case of the hacking into the Office of Personnel Management was not raised by either side. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to talk about a delicate matter. The Chinese, angered by the indictment by the Justice Department in May of five members of the People's Liberation Army on charges of cyberespionage, refused a request at the dialogue by the Americans to restart a joint cyber working group. China suspended the work of the group that brought together American and Chinese negotiators to discuss cyber issues and has complained that National Security Agency documents made public by Edward J. Snowden showed the United States had used cyberespionage to gain economic advantage. Mr. Xi, who invited the American and Chinese delegations to meet him Thursday afternoon at a session that was partly open to reporters, called on the two countries to work on building a ''new model of major country relationship,'' a phrase he frequently uses to imply an equal status between the United States and China. It is an expression that the Obama administration has been reluctant to endorse for fear that it would confer legitimacy to China's various territorial claims, including in the East China Sea and South China Sea. The Obama administration sent senior officials to the dialogue, including Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve; Michael Froman, the United States trade representative; Ernest Moniz, secretary of energy; Penny Pritzker, secretary of commerce, and John D. Podesta, counselor to President Obama, who specializes in climate change. The Americans appeared pleased about what they called serious discussions on how to reduce carbon emissions. The presence of Mr. Podesta, who the Chinese know is close to Mr. Obama and is committed to climate change policies, added weight, they said. A joint working group on climate change announced that both countries would develop new greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards. ''This effort has to be mutual and has to be accompanied by commitments which are defined by the actions we will actually take,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''It's not about one country making a demand of the other.'' Even so, China's chief climate official, Xie Zhenhua, said China, which still considers itself a developing country, should not be subject to the same rules for greenhouse gas emissions as the United States, suggesting that Beijing will oppose attempts to impose them at next year's world climate conference in Paris. "
North Korea Denies Role in Sony Pictures Hacking,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea on Sunday denied responsibility for hacking the computers of Sony Pictures Entertainment but appeared to relish the attack that crippled the computer systems of the Hollywood company, which is set to release a comedy that involves a plot to assassinate its leader, Kim Jong-un. Sony Pictures is producing ''a film abetting a terrorist act while hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership,'' a spokesman of the National Defense Commission, Mr. Kim's top governing agency in Pyongyang, was quoted as saying by the North's Korean Central News Agency.  The spokesman said North Korea did not know why Sony was targeted, but he speculated that the attack ''might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers with'' North Korea in its struggle to ''put an end to U.S. imperialism.'' A hacking attack last month shut down the computer systems of Sony Pictures and exposed a trove of internal data, including salary figures. North Korea has since emerged as a possible suspect because it has been criticizing Sony Pictures for producing ''The Interview,'' a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco that involves the assassination plot against Mr. Kim. North Korea saw no humor there. It has called the movie ''an act of war'' sponsored by Washington's ''hostile policy.'' Mr. Kim's family has been ruling North Korea since the late 1940s with a totalitarian grip that has rested upon a personality cult. The government in Pyongyang lashes out at any attempt from the outside to criticize Mr. Kim, calling it a challenge to the ''supreme dignity'' of the entire country. It has been especially sensitive about such criticism in recent weeks because there was an American-supported attempt at the United Nations to ask the Security Council to refer Mr. Kim to an international criminal court for human rights abuses. No direct evidence has emerged yet that links North Korea to the hacking attack at Sony Pictures, and digital-security analysts have been divided over the likelihood of its involvement. On Sunday, North Korea said there were ''a great number of supporters and sympathizers'' with North Korea ''all over the world,'' including ''champions of peace'' who might initiate more ''righteous reaction'' against the United States' ''evildoings.'' South Korean and American officials have been increasingly concerned about North Korea's capability to carry out attacks on computers, especially after huge disruptions of bank, government, media and military websites in South Korea in recent years that South Korea attributed to attacks sponsored by the North. North Korea has denied involvement and instead blamed South Korea for disrupting its websites in recent years. North Korea itself is cut off from the Internet, except for a handful of state-approved websites linked to the World Wide Web. But South Korean officials and defectors from North Korea said North Korea has been training specialists in computer attacks for decades to collect technological data through the Internet, spread the country's propaganda online and initiate hacking attacks. In a report to Congress last year, the United States Defense Department said that given its bleak economic outlook, North Korea might see hacking attacks as ''a cost-effective way to develop asymmetric, deniable military options.'' In October, South Korea's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers that North Korean-sponsored hackers had spread game apps containing malicious viruses from May through September, affecting an estimated 20,000 South Korean smartphone users. It did not reveal how it determined that such attacks were sponsored by North Korea. "
Chinese Web Outage Blamed on Censorship Glitch,"Chinese authorities on Wednesday suggested that a major disruption of the Internet in China this week was the work of hackers. But others blamed the massive outage on a malfunction of the government's own Great Firewall, the sprawling, hidden infrastructure used to restrict what ordinary Chinese can see online. Millions of Internet users in China attempting to access a range of websites on Tuesday afternoon were rerouted to servers run by a small American firm dedicated to fighting web censorship. For more than an hour, Chinese users reported being unable to access websites ending in .com, .net, and .org, including the popular search engine Baidu and microblogging platform Sina Weibo. The problem is said to have affected as much as two-thirds of Internet traffic in China.  The state-run Global Times  the disruption a ""mysterious attack"" most likely carried out by hackers. Other official media also quoted experts speculating about a hacking attack. During a regular news briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said he had noted reports of involvement by Falun Gong,  a banned spiritual movement, but he said, ""I don't know who did this or where it came from."" ""What I want to point out is this reminds us once again that maintaining Internet security needs strengthened international cooperation,"" he added. ""This again shows that China is a victim of hacking."" The China Internet Network Information Center wrote on its official Weibo account that the outage was caused by a glitch in the Domain Name System servers that convert alphabetical website addresses into the numerical addresses of computers on the Internet. Instead of matching the names of popular Chinese sites with their proper addresses, the DNS servers instead redirected users to an address associated with the homepage of United States-based Dynamic Internet Technology. DIT is best known for a software tool called Freegate that helps Internet users in China circumvent the government's pervasive system of online censorship and filters. According to its website, the firm's clients include Epoch Times, a newspaper affiliated with Falun Gong; United States-funded Voice of America and Radio Free Asia; and the New York-based activist group Human Rights in China. Bill Xia, a Falun Gong adherent who founded DIT after emigrating to the United States, denied any involvement in the Internet outage. Instead, he said in an email that the problem could have been caused by a ""misconfiguration"" in the government's Great Firewall, which controls online traffic across multiple Internet service providers in China. ""Only the Great Firewall has this capability ready,"" he said. Greatfire.org, an independent site that collects and shares data about Internet censorship in China, echoed that theory in a blog post. The site said it tried sending a website address to a public DNS server operated by Google. Outside China, the server converted the address properly. But inside China, it replied with the address associated with DIT. ""The bogus response,"" it wrote, ""could only have been returned by GFW,"" an abbreviation for the Great Firewall. The blog post noted that the Chinese authorities sometimes block access to websites by ""poisoning"" the DNS process that converts web addresses into numerical addresses. When this happens, users trying to visit particular sites are sent to the wrong servers. ""Our hypothesis,"" it said, is that the Great Firewall may have intended to block DIT's address but ""accidentally"" poisoned the DNS process to send users there instead. Greatfire.org dismissed speculation that DIT may have hacked the Great Firewall to attract Chinese users and spread antigovernment material, noting that the DIT server that was inundated with traffic was not delivering any content at the time. If the company could hack into the Great Firewall, it added, ""it can accomplish so much more than messing the entire Chinese Internet up."" By Wednesday afternoon, Internet access had been restored in most parts of the country, though some regions were still reporting residual network disruptions.  "
"For Cisco, Higher Stock Price Is Still Chasing Ambition","Cisco was a Wall Street darling after trading hours on Wednesday, but not for the reasons John T. Chambers, the company's longtime chief executive, wants it to be. The stock gained 7 percent after hours, following Cisco's report of better-than-expected earnings for its most recent quarter. That's mostly a comment on what the expectations were. In its fiscal third quarter Cisco had net income of $2.2 billion, down from $2.5 billion a year ago. Revenue was $11.5 billion, down from $12.2 billion.  Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected Cisco to show earnings of 48 cents per share, using nonstandard accounting. Cisco's nonstandard earnings per share was 51 cents. After hours, Cisco shares were trading at $22.81, about where they were before Cisco released worse-than-expected earnings last November. While traders focused on slightly better sales management, and possibly improving markets for Cisco's computer-networking gear in the United States and Europe, Mr. Chambers was stressing Cisco's efforts in large computing systems, like security across multiple networks or management of millions of sensors at the same time. ""We're delivering solutions, not just technology, in a way we have not in the past,"" he said in an interview following the release of Cisco's fiscal-third-quarter earnings. ""We have moved for years to an architectural approach."" The reason for this, he said, is that the complexities of even managing individual pieces of a system, like security or power management, have become vast. In addition, he said, we are creating systems of systems, like industrial sensor networks that must also look out for computer hackers, which can be managed only by a company that oversees many parts of the overall system. Mr. Chambers said one of his customers was a mining company, which he did not name, ""that gets 19,000 data feeds a second"" from various machines it is running. ""If the equipment fails, it can take down a job site. You have to manage priorities, or else you over- or under-service things."" Managing that, he says, ""is about process and architecture.""  It is also more expensive. Cisco recently pledged $1 billion toward the creation of an ""Intercloud,"" or a secure, high-performance series of Internet-connected networks. Mr. Chambers also said he was spending money to build a specialty sales force to handle complex architectures. Wall Street was probably not considering the scale of this ambition as it bid up Cisco shares. Cisco's longer game of hybrids, like networked networks, a secure Internet of things and collaboration systems that offer big data insights, is the more interesting one to consider. At the low end of the business, Mr. Chambers said, Cisco would most likely compete with mass-market manufacturers of commodity systems. At the upper end, he said, it isn't clear that there is any competition at all. ""Almost no one is going down this path besides us,"" he said. ""If we're right, it's going to be great.""  If he's wrong, things will certainly get more complex for him.  "
Chinese Defense Statement on the U.S. Cyberspying Indictment,"The Chinese Ministry of National Defense has issued a statement on its website condemning the United States indictments of five Chinese military officers on charges of hacking into commercial networks to steal corporate secrets. Following is a translation by The New York Times:  On May 19 Beijing time, the United States Department of Justice indicted five members of the Chinese military on charges of so-called commercial cybertheft. China expresses its strong indignation and staunch opposition to this, and already had made solemn representations to the United States. China's stance on Internet security issues has been consistent and clear. China is a protector of Internet security, and the Chinese government and military have never engaged or participated in any theft of commercial secrets over the Internet. The United States' claims of so-called commercial cybertheft and so on have been spun out of thin air to bamboozle public opinion, and they have been made out of nefarious motives. For a long time, the relevant agencies of the United States have relied on its advanced technology and infrastructure to carry out large-scale, organized cybertheft, bugging and monitoring against foreign politicians, businesses and individuals. These facts are known to all. The hypocrisy and double standards of the United States regarding Internet security issues have been abundantly obvious from WikiLeaks to the Snowden affair. The Chinese military is a serious victim of this kind of U.S. conduct. Statistics show that the Internet user terminals of the Chinese military have come under many attacks from abroad in recent years, and IP addresses show that a considerable number of these originated in the United States. China demands that the United States give it a clear explanation of its cybertheft, bugging and monitoring activities, and immediately stop such activity. Chinese-U.S. military relations have been enjoying healthy development, and this step by the United States flies in the face of its vow to ""strive to build healthy, stable and reliable military-to-military relations,"" and it has seriously damaged bilateral mutual confidence. The U.S. side should demonstrate true sincerity and take substantive actions to promote the healthy and stable development of Chinese-U.S. state-to-state and military-to-military relations.  "
Symantec Discovers Spy Code Lurking on Computer Networks,"Security researchers say they have discovered a sophisticated piece of malicious code spying on researchers, governments, businesses, and critical telecommunications infrastructure since 2008. The malware, called Regin, was first discovered by Symantec, the antivirus company, which released a white paper describing its findings on Sunday. On Monday, The Intercept, a digital magazine started by the journalist Glenn Greenwald, reported that the Regin malware is part of a decade-long joint operation by the National Security Agency and its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters, or G.C.H.Q. The Intercept report is based in part on disclosures from former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden. ""In the world of malware threats, only a few rare examples can truly be considered groundbreaking and almost peerless,"" Symantec wrote. ""What we have seen in Regin is just such a class of malware.""  Symantec found evidence that the malware has been used on targets in 10 countries, primarily Saudi Arabia and Russia, as well as Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Mexico, Ireland, Belgium and Austria. The Intercept reported Monday that the malware had been used to spy on companies in the European Union, notably Belgacom, a partly state-owned Belgian phone and Internet provider. The Regin malware is highly customizable, researchers said, and can be tweaked to include new features and capabilities, depending on the target. Symantec's researchers estimate that it likely took months ""if not years"" to develop and said the malware's ""authors have gone to great lengths to cover its tracks."" The researchers believe the malware was first used to spy on individuals in 2008, until it was ""abruptly withdrawn"" in 2011. The Intercept reported that the malware was used to infect a Belgacom server in 2010. Then, last year, Symantec said the authors started using a new version of the same malware to spy on a variety of victims. Among them: academic researchers, individuals and small businesses, companies in the airline, energy and hospitality sectors as well as telecom companies, in what researchers believe was an attempt to gain access to telephone calls routed through their call centers. Regin is undeniably a spy tool, based on its functions, the researchers said. It is configured to grab screenshots and take over a computer mouse's point-and-click function. It can also grab passwords, monitor network traffic and gather information from the computer's memory. It can scan for and retrieve deleted files. Beyond those basic functions, its capabilities vary from target to target. In one case, Symantec's researcher found that Regin had been tweaked to sniff traffic sent to mobile telephone base station controllers. In another case, it had been customized to parse mail from Microsoft's Exchange email databases. One of the remaining mysteries, researchers say, is how victims are infected with Regin in the first place. Symantec said the infection method varies from target to target. In one case, it directed victims to spoofed versions of popular websites, then downloaded malware onto their machines. In the case of Belgacom, The Intercept said it found evidence that the attackers sent employees at the company to a fake LinkedIn page that downloaded the malware onto their machines. In another case, Symantec said, it originated from Yahoo's Instant Messenger service, through an ""unconfirmed exploit."" The Regin malware attacks its victims in different stages, with each stage hidden and encrypted, except for the initial encounter. ""It goes to extraordinary lengths to conceal itself and its activities on compromised computers,"" Symantec researchers wrote in their white paper. ""Its stealth combines many of the most advanced techniques that we have ever seen in use."" Symantec discovered five stages of the attack, but because each stage was encrypted, they could only parse the attack once they had collected information on all five stages. ""Only by acquiring all five stages is it possible to analyze and understand the threat,"" Symantec noted. The multi-staged design of the malware is akin to that of other espionage tools that security researchers believe were the work of nation states, notably Flame, Stuxnet and Duqu - three pieces of malware that were used to spy on computers in Iran and were believed to be a joint effort by the United States and Israel. Like those spy tools, researchers believe Regin's development took years and could only have been developed by ""a nation state"" with the time and resources. ""Its design makes it highly suited for persistent, long-term surveillance operations against targets."" The Intercept reported Monday that the tool was part of a joint N.S.A.- G.C.H.Q. program, codenamed ""Operation Socialist."" The N.S.A. did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ""The discovery of Regin serves to highlight how significant investments continue to be made into the development of tools for use in intelligence gathering,"" Symantec researchers said. They added, ""Many components of Regin have still gone undiscovered and additional functionality and versions may exist.""                       "
Six Indicted on Hacking Charges Related to Hot StubHub Tickets,"Authorities indicted six people on charges that they were part of an international crime ring that defrauded the online ticketing service StubHub of some $1.6 million.   The indictments, which were announced Wednesday by Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, included a Russian national who was apprehended while on vacation in Spain, three men in London, one in the United States and one in Canada.  They are charged in connection with using stolen credit and debit card numbers to purchase thousands of tickets to coveted events such as Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z concerts, Yankees baseball games, the U.S. Open, and popular Broadway shows like ""Book of Mormon,"" then reselling them and pocketing the profits, according to court documents unsealed on Wednesday.   The six are being charged in New York State Supreme Court with varying degrees of money-laundering, grand larceny, criminal possession of stolen property and identity theft, among other charges.   Security experts say the raid was a rare coordinated effort by a private company and international law enforcement agencies spanning several countries.   ""Cybercrime is not the act of a single group, but rather a large effort made by multiple factions and individuals, sometimes working together to make a profit, other times working against each other to secure a market,"" Adam Kujawa, the head of threat intelligence at the computer security company Malwarebytes, wrote in an email. ""You can imagine that it would take an equal effort from that of law enforcement in order to take down some of the larger threats faced by users and organizations today."" StubHub, which is owned by eBay, has been working with law enforcement around the world since 2013. The company was alerted to a small number of accounts that had been taken over by fraudsters who had gained access to the accounts either using leaked login credentials and passwords from another company's breach, or by installing so-called keyloggers on the victims' machines, which record their every keyboard stroke in order to steal their credentials.  Working with foreign law enforcement and the Manhattan district attorney's office, authorities were able to trace fraudulent activity back to Internet protocol, or I.P. addresses, PayPal accounts, bank accounts and other financial accounts controlled by the indicted individuals. Vadim Polyakov, 30, and Nikolay Matveychuk, 21, were charged with purchasing some 3,500 online tickets, according to unsealed court documents. Daniel Petryszyn, 28, Laurence Brinkmeyer, 29, and Bryan Caputo, 29, were charged with reselling the tickets and distributing the proceeds to multiple PayPal accounts, and bank accounts in Britain and Germany.  One of these accounts belonged to a Russian national, Sergei Kirin, 37, who advertised money-laundering services online, and laundered the profits for a fee. Thousands of dollars were also split and transferred to other money launderers in London and Toronto, according to the indictment.  Mr. Polyakov was arrested while traveling in Barcelona on July 3. On Wednesday, investigators from the Manhattan district attorney's office, New York City police, Secret Service and police from Bergen and Hudson Counties, executed search warrants in New York and New Jersey at the homes of Mr. Petryszyn, Mr. Brinkmeyer and Mr. Caputo. The City of London Police arrested three other men in London on suspicion of money-laundering. Another man was arrested in Toronto on charges of money-laundering. Authorities noted that the case was the second major international cybercrime bust in the last year. In August 2013, the Manhattan district attorney's office announced the convictions of 15 people in connection with a cybercrime ring that extended from Brooklyn to Ukraine. They were convicted of trafficking  in more than 95,000 stolen credit cards, which were used for more than $5 million in fraud.  Robert Capps, a former security executive at StubHub, said the case would send a strong message to cybercriminals. ""You are no longer safe to travel and operate outside of your home country without significant risk of arrest and prosecution,"" Mr. Capps wrote in an email. ""Confined within the borders of their home country, I suspect we'll see a change in behavior of some of these criminals.""                       "
China Is Asked to Help Block Korea Hacking,"WASHINGTON --  The Obama administration has sought China's help in recent days in blocking North Korea's ability to launch cyberattacks, the first steps toward the ''proportional response'' President Obama vowed to make the North pay for the assault on Sony Pictures -- and as part of a campaign to issue a broader warning against future hacking, according to senior administration officials. ''What we are looking for is a blocking action, something that would cripple their efforts to carry out attacks,'' one official said.     So far, the Chinese have not responded. Their cooperation would be critical, since virtually all of North Korea's telecommunications run through Chinese-operated networks.     It is unclear that China would choose to help, given tensions over computer security between Washington and Beijing since the Justice Department in May indicted five hackers working for the Chinese military on charges of stealing sensitive information from American companies.   The secret approach to China comes as American officials, convening a half-dozen meetings in the White House Situation Room last week, including one of the top national security team on Thursday night, have been developing options to give to the president during his vacation in Hawaii. They include new economic sanctions, mirroring those recently placed on Russian oligarchs and officials close to President Vladimir V. Putin, which would cut off their access to cash -- the one perk that allows the elite surrounding Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, to live lifestyles their starving countrymen can barely imagine.    The sessions also included discussions of ''information operations'' directed at the North Korean people, officials said, but similar efforts by South Korea to sway opinion in the North have often created a furious backlash.   As part of the administration effort to plan a response to the first major, state-sponsored destructive computer-network attacks on American soil, the president has asked the military's Cyber Command, which is led by the same four-star admiral who directs the National Security Agency, to come up with a range of offensive options that could be directed at North Korea.   For now, the White House appears to have declined to consider what one Defense Department official termed ''a demonstration strike'' in cyberspace, which could have included targets such as North Korean military facilities, computer network servers and communications networks.    One obvious potential target is Yongbyon, the center of North Korea's nuclear program, where the state has invested huge sums to produce plutonium and uranium fuel for its small arsenal of nuclear weapons. Because of its geographic and technological isolation, Yongbyon is considered a far harder target to attack than were Iran's nuclear facilities, the subject of an American cyberoperation code-named Olympic Games.    The administration's restraint grows out of a concern over the risk of escalation with North Korea, since the United States has far more vulnerable targets, from its power grid to its financial markets, than North Korea.    ''There are a lot of constraints on us, because we live in a giant glass house,'' said one official involved in the high-level debates. The official said the challenge was to find a mix of actions that ''the North Koreans will notice'' but that will not be so public that Mr. Kim's government loses face and feels compelled to respond.   Several administration officials said the White House woke up late to the growing confrontation with North Korea, with senior officials not realizing at first the scope and long-term implications of the attacks on Sony for its plans for a Christmas Day release of ''The Interview,'' a crude comedy built around a far-fetched C.I.A. plot to have two bumbling journalists assassinate the young North Korean leader. But by last week, the combination of the destructive attack on Sony's computers and the threat of attacks on moviegoers at any theater that showed the film sent the administration scrambling for a response.   In interviews over the past two days, officials said the president's decision was to have the United States directly accuse the North Korean government -- a public naming of the perpetrators that went beyond previous American criticism. Then the president, in his year-end news conference, cast Mr. Kim as an insecure leader so weak that he could be provoked by an outlandish satire, even while Mr. Obama castigated Sony Pictures for giving in to intimidation by withdrawing the film.    The attacks on Sony appear to have been routed through China and then conducted through servers in Singapore, Thailand and Bolivia. Each of the countries, officials said, had been contacted in an effort to cut off access for the hackers.    But the key is China. United States officials said that American efforts to block North Korea's access to the Internet, which is available only to the military and the elite, would necessarily impinge on Chinese sovereignty. But they also saw in the confrontation a chance to work with the Chinese on a subject the two countries have been warily discussing for several years: Establishing ''rules of the road'' for acceptable behavior in cyberspace.   By some accounts, what the administration is trying to create is a computer equivalent to the Proliferation Security Initiative, an effort begun in the Bush administration, also aimed squarely at North Korea, to stop the shipment of nuclear materials and other weaponry. But in cyberspace that is a far harder task, since it is easier for the North Koreans to reroute computer code at lightning speed than to reroute a cargo ship carrying missiles.   Any financial sanctions also are tricky. The North is under perhaps the heaviest sanctions on earth. Yet the one sanction in the past decade that caused the most pain to the North Korean leadership was the freezing of its accounts at a small bank in Macau, which held the money the North Korean leadership uses to buy luxury goods -- and serves as an escape route if officials need to leave the country.    Even if Mr. Obama was ready to respond with a cyberattack, it would not be instantaneous.    ''One of the things people often overlook is the complexity and time it takes to launch an attack,'' said Oren Falkowitz, a former analyst at the National Security Agency who now runs Area 1, a security company based in Menlo Park, Calif. ''Most attacks take hundreds of days, if not years, to plan. People often want to move quickly, but they forget a lot of legwork must be done.''    In the past, other countries have resorted to basic distributed denial-of-service attacks, in which hackers flood a target's systems with Internet traffic until they collapse under the load. But unlike systems in the United States, very little of North Korea's network infrastructure is connected to the global Internet. The result, Mr. Falkowitz says, is that a similar denial-of-service attack on the North would amount to ''ankle biting.''    Tom Kellermann, a former member of the presidential commission on cybersecurity, said one option was what security experts refer to as a ''hack back,'' in which they use the attackers' own computer footprints and back doors to deploy an attack that destroys North Korea's attack infrastructure, or compromises the integrity of the machines that did the hacking. For example, the United States could deploy a malicious payload that encrypts the data on North Korea's machines, or renders them unable to reboot -- clearly ''proportional,'' in the president's words, because that was what happened to Sony's computers.   But attack tools can be swapped out, and by destroying attackers' systems, the United States would lose its ability to monitor them for future attacks.   Mr. Kellermann predicted a campaign of information warfare, in which the United States plays on North Korea's worst fears by using its access to the North Korean domestic computer and radio systems to deploy propaganda inside North Korea's closed media bubble.

Hackers' Attack on a Giant Bank Affects Millions,"Updated, 9:03 p.m. | A cyberattack this summer on JPMorgan Chase compromised the accounts of 76 million households and seven million small businesses, a tally that dwarfs previous estimates by the bank and puts the intrusion among the largest ever. The details of the breach -- disclosed in a securities filing on Thursday -- emerge at a time when consumer confidence in the digital operations of corporate America has already been shaken. Target, Home Depot and a number of other retailers have sustained major data breaches. Last year, the information of 40 million cardholders and 70 million others were compromised at Target, while an attack at Home Depot in September affected 56 million cards.  But unlike retailers, JPMorgan, as the largest bank in the nation, has financial information in its computer systems that goes beyond customers' credit card details and potentially includes more sensitive data. ''We've migrated so much of our economy to computer networks because they are faster and more efficient, but there are side effects,'' said Dan Kaminsky, a researcher who works as chief scientist at White Ops, a security company. Until just a few weeks ago, executives at JPMorgan said they believed that only one million accounts were affected, according to several people with knowledge of the attacks. As the severity of the intrusion -- which began in June but was not discovered until July -- became more clear in recent days, bank executives scrambled for the second time in three months to contain the fallout and to reassure skittish customers that no money had been taken and that their financial information remained secure. The hackers appeared to have obtained a list of the applications and programs that run on JPMorgan's computers -- a road map of sorts -- which they could crosscheck with known vulnerabilities in each program and web application, in search of an entry point back into the bank's systems, according to several people with knowledge of the results of the bank's forensics investigation, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity. Operating overseas, the hackers gained access to the names, addresses, phone numbers and emails of JPMorgan account holders. In its regulatory filing on Thursday, JPMorgan said that there was no evidence that account information, including passwords or Social Security numbers, had been taken. The bank also noted that there was no evidence of fraud involving the use of customer information. Still, until the JPMorgan breach surfaced in July, banks were viewed as relatively safe from online assaults because of their investment in defenses and trained security staff. Most previous breaches at banks have involved stealing personal identification numbers for A.T.M. accounts, not burrowing deep into the internal workings of a bank's computer systems. Even if no customer financial information was taken, the apparent breadth and depth of the JPMorgan attack shows how vulnerable Wall Street institutions are to cybercrime. In 2011, hackers broke into the systems of the Nasdaq stock market, but did not penetrate the part of the system that handles trades. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, has acknowledged the growing digital threat. In his annual letter to shareholders, Mr. Dimon said, ''We're making good progress on these and other efforts, but cyberattacks are growing every day in strength and velocity across the globe.'' Even though the bank has fortified its defenses against the attacks, Mr. Dimon wrote, the battle is ''continual and likely never-ending.'' On Thursday, some lawmakers weighed in. Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, said ''the data breach at JPMorgan Chase is yet another example of how Americans' most sensitive personal information is in danger.'' Hackers drilled deep into the bank's vast computer systems, reaching more than 90 servers, the people with knowledge of the investigation said. As they analyze the contours of the breach, investigators in law enforcement remain puzzled, partly because there is no evidence that the attackers looted any money from customer accounts. That lack of any apparent profit motive has generated speculation among the law enforcement officials and security experts that the hackers, which some thought to be from Southern Europe, may have been sponsored by elements of the Russian government, the people with knowledge of the investigation said. By the time the bank's security team discovered the breach in late July, hackers had already obtained the highest level of administrative privilege to dozens of the bank's computer servers, according to the people with knowledge of the investigation. It is still unclear how hackers managed to gain such deep access. The people with knowledge of the investigation said it would take months for the bank to swap out its programs and applications and renegotiate licensing deals with its technology suppliers, possibly giving the hackers time to mine the bank's systems for unpatched, or undiscovered, vulnerabilities that would allow them re-entry into JPMorgan's systems. Beyond its disclosures, JPMorgan did not comment on what its investigation had found. Kristin Lemkau, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said that describing the bank's breach as among the largest was ''comparing apples and oranges.'' Preparing for the disclosure on Thursday, JPMorgan retained the law firm WilmerHale to help with its regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, people with knowledge of the matter said. Earlier on Thursday, some executives -- Barry Sommers, the chief executive of Chase's consumer bank -- flew back to New York from Naples, Fla., where they had convened for a leadership conference, these people said. The initial discovery of the hack sent chills down Wall Street and prompted an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The bank was also forced to update its regulators, including the Federal Reserve, on the extent of the breach. Faced with the rising threat of online crime, JPMorgan has said it plans to spend $250 million on digital security annually, but had been losing many of its security staff to other banks over the last year, with others expected to leave soon. After Breach, JPMorgan Still Seeks to Determine Extent of Attack This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Preventing the Next Data Breach,"The alarming discovery that hackers stole the credit card and personal information of tens of millions of Americans from Target's computers is yet another reminder of human vulnerability in the digital age. The more practical and immediate lesson, however, is that retailers, banks and other corporations can do far more than they have done so far to protect customers from identity theft and financial fraud.  At last count, hackers had stolen the credit or debit card information of 40 million Target shoppers, as well as information like the names, addresses and email addresses of 70 million customers. Though the company has said little about how its system might have been compromised, experts say the attackers, who may have been based in Russia, inserted malicious software into Target's poorly secured systems during the holiday shopping season. It was the latest in a series of high-profile attacks against retailers like T.J. Maxx and companies that process card payments like Heartland Payment Systems. Many of the stolen card numbers have been showing up on black markets where such information is traded. Some Target shoppers have had to deal with fraudulent charges. Experts warn that things could get worse when criminals start using the personal information they've stolen to try to commit identity theft by taking out loans and opening new credit card accounts in the names of Target customers. Even as the investigation into the origins of the heist continues, Target and other companies must begin investing in better security measures to keep intruders out and start investing in software that will trigger alarms when it detects unauthorized access. A Verizon report on data breaches found that nearly four-fifths of intrusions in 2012 were of ''low difficulty,'' meaning hackers found trespass remarkably easy. Companies also need to think carefully about what data they are collecting and storing. By keeping lots of sensitive information, they place themselves and their customers at considerable -- and in some cases unnecessarily greater -- risk than if they had deleted the data or never collected it. To take one startling example, security experts say there was absolutely no reason for Target to have stored the four-digit personal identification numbers, or PINs, of their customers' debit cards. (Target says the codes were kept in an encrypted file, but hackers have broken open encrypted documents before.) Retailers and banks can also reduce risk by moving away from cards that use magnetic strips, which are easily faked. Many countries in Europe, Asia and elsewhere have already replaced magnetic strips with chips, which are harder to duplicate. Chip-based cards also require customers to enter a secure code before they can be used. That's partly why the United States accounts for nearly half of all global credit card fraud, even though it generates only about a quarter of all credit card spending. American retailers, including Target, have resisted (foolishly, as it turns out) the introduction of chip-based cards because they would have to invest in new equipment to handle them. (Target now says it supports chip-based cards.) No security measure will ever rid the economy of theft and fraud completely. But there is evidence that companies could do a lot more to protect data. "
Luck Played Role in Discovery of Data Breach at JPMorgan Affecting Millions," When it comes to defending a large company against an online attack, sometimes luck and timing can mean as much as spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year on computer security. The broad attack this summer on JPMorgan Chase, which compromised information for 76 million households and seven million small businesses, took the bank's security team more than two months to detect before it was stopped. But the intrusion at the nation's largest bank could have gone on for longer if not for a critical discovery by a Milwaukee security consulting firm that helped JPMorgan uncover the full extent of its breach. That firm, Hold Security, uncovered a repository of a billion stolen passwords and usernames that it said had been pilfered by a loose-knit gang of Russian hackers. The hackers, according to the consulting firm, had infiltrated more than 420,000 websites. Hold Security's discovery was first reported by The New York Times on Aug. 5, but in the days leading up to that report, some American companies, including JPMorgan, received a preview of its findings, said people briefed on the matter.  In late July, as Hold Security began sharing its findings with its clients, some of the security specialists at JPMorgan began to suspect that hackers were inside the bank's systems because of some unusual activity there, said other people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The hope was that the Hold Security data might provide some clues about a possible breach at the bank. It did, but in a roundabout way. The data pointed to a big problem at the website for the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge, these people said. It contained some of the combinations of passwords and email addresses used by race participants who had registered on the Corporate Challenge website, an online platform for a series of annual charitable races that JPMorgan sponsors in major cities and that is run by an outside vendor. The races are open to bank employees and employees of other corporations. The criminal database also included the certificate for the website of the Corporate Challenge site's vendor, Simmco Data Systems, indicating a serious breach that allowed hackers to pose as the race website operator and intercept traffic, such as race participants' login credentials, said a person briefed on the data the security firm collected. Certificates guarantee the identity of a website to a visitor's web browser. Using a stolen certificate, hackers can intercept any communications between a visitor and a website, including passwords. More disturbing, the stolen Simmco Data certificate was first compromised in April, suggesting that the hackers could have begun their attack on the bank at least four months before the bank noticed any unusual activity within its own network. It was not until early August, around the time Hold Security was approaching companies with its findings, that JPMorgan contacted Simmco Data. Employees at Simmco Data soon found evidence that hackers using suspicious Internet addresses had probed and infiltrated the server that ran the Corporate Challenge website, these same people said. Two employees from JPMorgan's data security team in Columbus, Ohio, traveled to Simmco Data's office to make copies of the files that had been compromised, said one of the people briefed on the matter. On Aug. 7, Simmco Data and JPMorgan began to disable the Corporate Challenge website to contain the breach. JPMorgan also briefed the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as bank regulators. Looking for the suspicious Internet addresses found on the Corporate Challenge website, the bank examined traffic on its own vast network, the people briefed on the matter said. It was not until then that the bank learned that JPMorgan's systems had been breached by the same hackers who broke into the Corporate Challenge website. This unusual series of events that led to the detection of the breach at JPMorgan shows just how difficult it is for companies to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals. The bank spends $250 million annually on security defense. But after the attack, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, said he was considering doubling that amount - an indication of the increasing threat from the attacks. In all, federal authorities say they believe the hackers that breached JPMorgan's systems tried to probe or infiltrate a dozen other financial institutions. Hold Security's founder, Alex Holden, said that he was surprised to learn from a reporter that the information his company had gathered about stolen passwords at the Corporate Challenge website played a critical role in helping JPMorgan solve its own even bigger and more significant data breach. ""If this is indeed is the case, we are very glad that we could positively contribute to the security of JPMorgan Chase infrastructure and customers,"" Mr. Holden said. He confirmed that the certificate for Simmco Data Systems remains vulnerable even today. David O. Simms, chief executive of Simmco, which has been managing the Corporate Challenge website for about a decade, said he did not know exactly when the attack on the racing website began. ""Our own research led us to believe that the attackers were fairly persistent, but made no conclusions as to their country of origin,"" he said. Ultimately JPMorgan's attackers made their way through 90 of the bank's servers, though the bank maintains that the damage to customers was limited. It said that the hackers did not get access to more sensitive personal information, like Social Security numbers or account balances, and that it had not seen any evidence of fraud involving the information that was taken, mostly names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. The bank also rejects characterizations that the hackers were roaming freely through its systems during the two months they went undetected. ""The criminals were only successful in accessing a select set of information - the overwhelming majority of doors and windows they tried to open remained securely locked,"" said Patricia Wexler, a JPMorgan spokeswoman. Three months after the attack was discovered and stopped, much remains unknown, including who, exactly, was behind the breach. The F.B.I. recently rejected an early theory that the hackers were backed by the Russian government, though a consensus has emerged that a loose gang of Russian criminals were responsible. Some Eastern European Internet addresses were used in the attack, and the fact that attackers used information from a Russian criminal database points to Russian cybercriminal involvement, security experts say. Even though the same hackers were apparently responsible for the breach at the bank and the race vendor, Ms. Wexler said the hackers were unable to go directly from the Corporate Challenge website into the bank's network. The Corporate Challenge website is run on a separate server that is housed at Online Tech, an Internet hosting firm in Ann Arbor, Mich. JPMorgan has determined that the hackers did not gain access to its systems through any of its outside vendors, Ms. Wexler said. Evidence suggests hackers tested stolen usernames and passwords from the Hold Security trove on an older system handling bank employee benefits. When those worked, they tested the credentials on other bank systems, two of the people briefed on the matter said, until they found a way in. The bank declined to comment on how the breach was carried out. Federal and state regulators are pushing banks to bulk up their own security and that of outside vendors, ranging from law firms to janitorial services. On Oct. 21, the Senate Banking Committee asked federal banking regulators and Treasury Department officials to outline steps to protect the financial system from online threats. ""The most notable thing about these recent cyberbreaches is not that they happened, but that they went on so long without being detected,"" said Scott Borg, the director and chief economist with the United States Cyber Consequences Unit. ""Companies are being blindsided, because they are not watching for the specific kinds of cyberattacks that are really going to hurt them.""  Jessica Silver-Greenberg contributed reporting.

P.F. Chang's Investigating Possible Data Breach,"P.F. Chang's China Bistro said Tuesday that it is investigating a potential security breach that may have led to the theft of information from thousands of customer credit cards. The possible theft was first reported by Brian Krebs, a security blogger, who noted thousands of fresh credit cards appeared on Rescator, a so-called carding site that was used to sell payment data after last year's Target network breach. Data from the magnetic strips of the latest stolen cards is selling for between $18 and $140 per card. Mr. Krebs said representatives from affected banks had purchased several stolen credit cards from carding sites and discovered that many were used recently at P.F. Chang's.  ""P.F. Chang's takes these matters very seriously and is currently investigating the situation, working with the authorities to learn more,"" Anne Deanovic, a spokeswoman for the company, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., said in a written statement. ""We will provide an update as soon as we have additional information."" Ms. Deanovic said the company had not yet tied fraudulent activity on customers' credit cards to the possible breach. The Secret Service, which has been conducting an inquiry into recent hacks at Target, Neiman Marcus and others, did not immediately return a request for comment. P.F. Chang's was acquired by private-equity firm Centerbridge Partners LP in 2012 for $1.1 billion. It operated 200 Asian restaurant bistros and some 170 Pei Wei Asian Diners at the time of the deal. It is the first significant appearance of information from stolen credit cards since March, when data from 282,000 cards was tied to a possible breach at Sally Beauty. If the breach is confirmed, P.F. Chang's will be the fifth major retail chain - after Target, Neiman Marcus, Michaels and Sally's Beauty - to acknowledge that its systems were recently compromised. In those cases, criminals installed so-called malware on retailers' systems, which fed customers' payment details back to their computer servers. A report from Bloomberg identified Sears as another company that had been breached, but the company and law enforcement officials have denied the reports. The tally of customers affected by these recent breaches now exceeds one-third of the American population. The same group of criminals in Eastern Europe are believed to be behind the hacks, and to be part of a broader cyberattack directed at as many as six other retailers, according to two people investigating the breaches who were not authorized to speak publicly. The entry point for each breach differed, according to one law enforcement official. At Target, it was believed to be a Pennsylvania company that provided heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration services to the retailer. Criminals were able to use the company's log-in credentials to gain access to Target's systems, and eventually to its point-of-sale systems. On Tuesday, a joint report by the Ponemon Institute, an independent security research firm, and DB Networks, a database security firm, found that retail companies are still unprepared for such attacks. In a survey of 595 computer-security experts in the United States, the majority - 64 percent - believed their organizations still lack the technology and tools to quickly detect database attacks. Only one-third said they do the kind of continuous database monitoring needed to identify irregular activity in their databases. Another 22 percent admitted that they do not scan at all. ""The best approach to avoid an attack on a retail organization is continuous monitoring, which helps you understand your environment to detect gratuitous or anomalous traffic,"" said Larry Ponemon, the founder of the Ponemon Institute in an interview Tuesday. ""All it takes is one successful attack.""                       "
Hackers Take Down World Cup Site in Brazil,"Hackers on Friday made good on their threat to take down the 2014 World Cup site in Brazil. Anonymous, the loose hacker collective, appears to have successfully taken down the site, which was offline for several hours Friday evening. The hacker group Anonymous Brasil has started a hacking campaign - Operation Hacking Cup, or #OpHackingCup - to protest poverty, corruption and police brutality.  Offline, activists have struggled to make their voices heard, but online, hackers have begun a series of distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks and have defaced websites. In one tweet, the group claims to have started more than 100 attacks since the World Cup began. Their targets have included the Brazilian Intelligence System, Hyundai Brazil, the Brazilian Football Confederation, Brazil's Justice Department, the Sao Paulo military police, Bank of Brazil and the Africa.com.br website. This week, the group claimed to have hacked the internal servers of the Brazilian federal police. As proof, the group released a collection of user names and passwords and a link to the federal police's internal log-in site, but the authenticity of the information could not be verified. Security experts say that they are not surprised. DDoS attacks typically involve hackers using networks of infected computers, called botnets, to fire traffic simultaneously at their victim until the site collapses. And these days, experts say, even a teenager can pull off a successful DDoS attack. ""In a time when anyone can Google up a 'botnet for hire' and use it to execute a 20-to-40-gigabits-per-second attack, from several thousands sources, no threat can be truly dismissed,"" said Igal Zeifman of Incapsula, a DDoS mitigation service. Anonymous has also threatened to hack World Cup sponsors, including Adidas, Budweiser, Coca-Cola and Emirates Airline. But so far, only Brazilian sites appear to have been affected. "
Russian Arrested in Guam on Array of U.S. Hacking Charges,"The Secret Service has said it has arrested what it believes is one of the world's most prolific traffickers of stolen financial information. On Saturday, the Secret Service arrested Roman Valerevich Seleznev, a Russian national, in Guam on charges that he hacked into in-store cash register systems at retailers throughout the United States between 2009 and 2011. The Secret Service would not say whether his arrest is tied to the recent spate of cyberattacks that affected the in-store cash register systems at Target, Neiman Marcus, Michaels and other retailers last year. But the arrest of Mr. Seleznev provides a lens onto the shadowy world of Russian hackers, the often sophisticated programmers who pose a security threat to American commerce and seem to operate with relative impunity. Law enforcement groups in Russia have been slow to pursue cybercriminals for reasons, security experts say, of possible corruption, incompetence or politics.  As long ago as March 2011, the United States attorney's office in Washington State identified Mr. Seleznev, a Russian citizen, in a sealed indictment as ""Track2,"" an underground alias that is an apparent reference to the Track 2 data that can be pulled off the magnetic strips of credit and debit cards. Such data include enough basic information - such as account numbers and expiration dates - that can be used to make fraudulent purchases. The indictment accuses Mr. Seleznev of hacking into the cash register systems of businesses across the United States and of operating computer servers and international online forums in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere where such stolen data is traded in the digital underground. But it was not until Saturday that Mr. Seleznev was detained in Guam. It was not yet clear how he was arrested, and the United States attorney's office in Washington State declined to elaborate. In a statement on Monday, the Secret Service said Mr. Seleznev's charges included five counts of bank fraud, eight counts of intentionally causing damage to a protected computer, eight counts of obtaining information from a protected computer, one count of possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices, two counts of trafficking unauthorized access devices, and five counts of aggravated identity theft. According to the indictment, which was unsealed Monday, Mr. Seleznev is accused of scanning devices for weaknesses and inserting malware that was capable of stealing credit card information. Mr. Seleznev is accused of using malware to steal 32,000 credit card numbers were stolen off computers at Broadway Grill, a restaurant in Seattle, between December 2009 and October 2010; the restaurant did not discover the thefts until late October 2010.Mr. Seleznev is also accused of pulling off similar heists at four other restaurants across Washington State and a number of other businesses across the United States, including Schlotzsky's Deli in Couer d' Alene, Idaho; Active Networks in Frostburg, Maryland; Days Jewelry in Maine; Latitude Bar and Grill in Manhattan; and the Phoenix Zoo. Mr. Seleznev is accused of stealing over 200,000 credit card numbers between November 2010 and February 2011 and of selling 140,000 credit card numbers on underground carding sites with names like bulba.cc and Track2.name, generating profits of more than $2 million, according to the indictment. ""This scheme involved multiple network intrusions and data thefts for illicit financial gain,"" Julia Pierson, director of the Secret Service, said in a statement. ""The adverse impact this individual and other transnational organized criminal groups have on our nation's financial infrastructure is significant and should not be underestimated."" Early Monday, Mr. Seleznev appeared at a court in Guam to hear charges. He will be held in custody there until his next hearing in two weeks. Mr. Seleznev faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of bank fraud. Charges of intentionally causing damage to a protected computer are punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and charges of obtaining information from a protected computer can get a five-year sentence. He also faces 10 years in prison for possessing more than 15 unauthorized access devices and another 10 years for trafficking in such devices. On top of that, he faces two years in prison if convicted of aggravated identity theft. The case remains under investigation by the United States Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force in Seattle and is being prosecuted by the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington. According to one government official, who declined to be identified because of the ongoing investigation, Mr. Seleznev was also among the members of ""Operation Open Market,"" a transnational criminal organization whose members bought and sold personal and financial information through online carding forums, such as the Russian underground website carder.su. In 2012, 19 members of that group were arrested, but Mr. Seleznev remained at large. He still faces a separate indictment in the District of Nevada on charges of racketeering as well as two counts of possession of 15 or more counterfeit and unauthorized access devices.  Those charges carry maximum penalties of up to 20 years in prison for racketeering and up to 10 years in prison for possession of 15 or more counterfeit and unauthorized access devices. Assistant United States Attorney Todd Greenberg would not comment on the means by which Mr. Seleznev, a Russian national, was detained in Guam. However, arrests in Russia over computer crimes are rare, even when hackers living in Russia have been outed by outside groups like The Spamhaus Project, a spam-prevention service based in Europe. According to Spamhaus, Russia is the world's third biggest source of Internet spam, after the United States and China. Politics may also play a role. Just last week, American security researchers accused the Russian government of systematically hacking into oil and gas companies in the United States and other Western nations. The United States has treated computer security as a law enforcement matter. But Russia has pushed for an international treaty that would regulate the use of online weapons by military or espionage agencies. The United States has been hesitant to press for such a treaty - in large part because its own National Security Agency is behind some of the broadest espionage operations - but it has continued to press for closer law enforcement cooperation on cybercrime.

Food Retailer Discloses a Data Breach,"Supervalu, a food retailer based in Minnesota, said on Thursday that its cash register system had been breached by hackers, possibly resulting in the theft of credit and debit card information from its supermarkets and liquor stores, as well as from an array of stores it sold last year.  The company provided a list of 180 Supervalu stores and stand-alone liquor stores and 29 franchised Cub stores affected by the breach, which happened from June 22 to July 17. The company said it had delayed notifying customers because it was working closely with law enforcement and a third-party forensics company to determine the breach's scope. The company said that it had been able to prevent the breach from affecting all its locations, which numbered 3,763 as of April. ''The intrusion was identified by our internal team, it was quickly contained, and we have no evidence of any misuse of any customer data,'' Sam Duncan, Supervalu's chief executive, said in a statement. But the breach may have gone far beyond just Supervalu's systems. Supervalu added that a related intrusion had reached the chain stores it sold to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management in March 2013. Supervalu continues to supply technology to those stores, and those that might have been affected include Albertsons, Jewel-Osco and Star Market. Supervalu and its affiliates are the most recent major retail chain -- after Target, P. F. Chang's and others -- to acknowledge that its payment systems were compromised by hackers in the last year. In those cases, criminals installed so-called malware on retailers' systems, which fed customers' payment details back to their computer servers. The issue, which first drew headlines in December when Target's huge security breach went public, has become a retail scourge. Last month, a joint report by the Homeland Security Department and the Secret Service said hackers were actively scanning software tools that let employees and vendors gain access to corporate systems from afar, then deploying computers to guess at credentials until they find the right combination. After capturing the data, the hackers send it back to their computers, and eventually sell account numbers on the black market, where a credit card number can fetch as much as $100. ''This looks much the same as the attack that impacted Target last year,'' said Steve Hultquist, an executive at RedSeal Networks, a security firm. ''These breaches continue to demonstrate the sophistication of the attackers and the reward they receive being worth the investment they make in their attacks.'' "
Report Says Cyberattacks Originated Inside Iran,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Iranian hackers were identified in a report released Tuesday as the source of coordinated attacks against more than 50 targets in 16 countries, many of them corporate and government entities that manage critical energy, transportation and medical services. Over the course of two years, according to Cylance, a security firm based in Irvine, Calif., Iranian hackers managed to steal confidential data from a long list of targets and, in some cases, infiltrated victims' computer networks to such an extent that they could take over, manipulate or easily destroy data on those machines.  Cylance called the attacks ''Operation Cleaver'' because the word cleaver frequently appeared in the attackers' malicious code. The New York Times was able to independently corroborate the firm's findings with another security firm, Crowdstrike, which said it had been tracking the same group of Iranian hackers for the past nine months under a different alias, ''Cutting Kitten''; kitten is the firm's naming convention for attack groups based in Iran, a nod to the Persian cat. The hackers used a set of tools that can spy on and potentially shut down critical control systems and computer networks, aiming them at targets in the United States, Canada, Israel, India, Qatar, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, France, England, China and South Korea. Cylance would identify only one of Cleaver's victims -- a Navy-Marine Corps network in San Diego that connects sailors, Marines and civilians across the United States -- in its 86-page report. But it said other victims in the United States included a major airline, a medical university, an energy company that specializes in natural gas production, an automobile manufacturer, a major military installation and a large military contractor. Cylance researchers said the hackers showed a penchant for oil and gas companies, compromising ''no less than nine of these companies around the world.'' They also zeroed in on universities in the United States, India, Israel and South Korea, and managed to steal pictures, passports and specific identifying information for students and faculty. But the ''most bone-chilling evidence'' Cylance said it collected was of attacks on transportation networks, including airlines and airports in South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Researchers said they had found evidence that hackers had gained complete remote access to airport gates and security control systems, ''potentially allowing them to spoof gate credentials.'' The Cylance report was released just hours after new details unfolded about a crippling cyberattack at Sony Pictures Entertainment. Security experts said that the attack at Sony, which leaked data and rendered many of the company's computers unusable, had the hallmarks of similar attacks conducted by North Korea last year against South Korean banks and broadcasters. The attack at Sony, and the newly disclosed attacks from Iran, have rattled security experts and officials, who say Iran and North Korea are the two adversaries they most worry about in cyberspace -- not because of their skill, but because they are motivated to cause destruction. Iran was the victim of a series of cyberattacks by the United States and Israel that included Stuxnet, a computer virus that was able to destroy a fifth of the centrifuges at an Iranian uranium enrichment facility. Since the discovery of Stuxnet in 2010, Iran has unleashed its own series of attacks, including a destructive attack at Saudi Aramco in which hackers destroyed data on 30,000 Aramco computers, replacing their contents with the image of a burning American flag. Iranian hackers are also believed to be behind a series of powerful denial-of-service attacks at American banks that have intermittently taken their banking sites offline. "
Hackers' Attack Cracked 10 Financial Institutions in Major Assault,"The huge cyberattack on JPMorgan Chase that touched more than 83 million households and businesses was one of the most serious computer intrusions into an American corporation. But it could have been much worse. Questions over who the hackers are and the approach of their attack concern government and industry officials. Also troubling is that about nine other financial institutions - a number that has not been previously reported - were also infiltrated by the same group of overseas hackers, according to people briefed on the matter. The hackers are thought to be operating from Russia and appear to have at least loose connections with officials of the Russian government, the people briefed on the matter said. It is unclear whether the other intrusions, at banks and brokerage firms, were as deep as the one that JPMorgan disclosed on Thursday. The identities of the other institutions could not be immediately learned.  The breadth of the attacks - and the lack of clarity about whether it was an effort to steal from accounts or to demonstrate that the hackers could penetrate even the best-protected American financial institutions - has left Washington intelligence officials and policy makers far more concerned than they have let on publicly. Some American officials speculate that the breach was intended to send a message to Wall Street and the United States about the vulnerability of the digital network of one of the world's most important banking institutions. ""It could be in retaliation for the sanctions"" placed on Russia, one senior official briefed on the intelligence said. ""But it could be mixed motives - to steal if they can, or to sell whatever information they could glean."" The JPMorgan hackers burrowed into the digital network of the bank and went down a path that gave them access to information about the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of account holders. They never made it into where the more critical financial information and personal information are stored. The bank's security team, which first discovered the attack in late July, managed to block the hackers before they could compromise the most sensitive information about tens of millions of JPMorgan customers, said several security experts and others briefed on the matter. The attack was not completely halted until the middle of August and it was only in recent days that the bank began to tally its full extent. American officials say they have been working with JPMorgan since the intrusion was detected, chiefly through the Treasury, the Secret Service and intelligence agencies that seek to find the source of the attacks. But that is slow work and one official cautioned against leaping to conclusions about the identities or the motives of the attackers. ""We've been wrong before,"" he said. Ways to Protect Yourself After the JPMorgan Hacking JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, has begun contacting customers and making clear that no money was taken from any accounts. There has been no evidence of any fraudulent use of customer information. Most of the household accounts belong to United States residents. The hackers ended up with the addresses, email addresses and phone numbers of everyone who logged into JPMorgan's websites and mobile applications in the recent past. Still, the recent attacks on the financial firms raise the possibility that the banks may not be up to the job of defending themselves. The attacks will also stoke questions about regulations governing when companies must inform regulators and their customers about a breach. ""It was a huge surprise that they were able to compromise a huge bank like JPMorgan,"" said Al Pascual, a security analyst with Javelin Strategy and Research. ""It scared the pants off many people."" Several financial regulators have warned that a coordinated attack on the banking system could set off another financial crisis. On Friday, George Jepsen, the Connecticut attorney general, opened an investigation into the breach at JPMorgan, while Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York's top financial regulator, began calling bank officials to warn them to take the threat more seriously. ""There needs to be far more urgency,"" Mr. Lawsky said in an interview. JPMorgan has also been working with law enforcement, including the F.B.I., since shortly after detecting the intrusion, which affected about 90 of the bank's computer servers. The bank said it believed that its systems were now secure and that the threat of the hackers' returning was over. ""To date, we have not seen any unusual fraud activity related to this incident,"" said Kristin Lemkau, a bank spokeswoman. ""We have identified and closed the known access paths. We have no evidence that the attackers are still in our system. We have apologized to our customers."" But much remains unanswered about the intrusion, including just who the hackers are, which other financial institutions were hit and why the hackers went down a path inside JPMorgan's computer system that contained troves of customer information, but not financial data. The intrusion also highlights a possible gap in United States regulations. Banks are not required to report data breaches and online intrusions unless the incident is deemed to have resulted in a financial loss to customers. Breach notification laws differ by state, but most laws require only that companies disclose a breach if customer names were stolen in conjunction with other information like a credit card, Social Security number or driver's license number. In some states, companies can wait up to a month to inform customers of a breach. Other state laws are more vague. In California, for example, banks, companies and large organizations must inform the state attorney general's office and consumers about a breach without unreasonable delay - a rule that some companies interpret liberally, officials say. This year, Kamala Harris, the California attorney general, sued the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, saying that it took more than a year for the foundation to disclose to some employees that their personal information may have been compromised. For years, there have been attempts in Congress to force companies to inform customers more quickly when their information has been compromised, but recent bills have failed to muster enough support. One bill, sponsored by Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, would create a clearinghouse where companies could exchange information about attacks. United States bank executives say privately that they already share intelligence informally about attacks, which are occurring frequently on their systems. This summer, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew called on Congress to pass legislation that he said would bolster the information sharing process. ""As it stands, our laws do not do enough to foster information sharing and defend the public from digital threats,"" Mr. Lew said. That the hackers were apparently able to move around JPMorgan's computer system undetected for several weeks is perhaps the most troubling aspect of the recent breach, officials at other large banks say. The hackers were able to attain high administrative privileges within JPMorgan's network, rooting more than 90 servers and rummaging through customer databases with detailed information for 76 million households and seven million small-business online accounts. As they looked around, according to one person with knowledge of the breach, the hackers gleaned some critical details of customers' accounts. With these, the hackers were able to determine whether the accounts fell within the private bank or in other business categories like mortgages. Some people briefed on the results of the attack contend that it was only a matter of time before attackers could have gained access to customer funds and critical personal data. Weeks into the attack, in mid-July, unusual behavior on the bank's network was spotted, and the attackers were stopped before they had a chance to pull any customer data back to their servers abroad. But they did make off with one file which has unnerved executives. That file contained a list of every application and program deployed on standard JPMorgan computers that hackers can crosscheck with known, or new, vulnerabilities in each system in a search for a backdoor entry. JPMorgan Chase Hacking Affects 76 Million Households Swapping out those programs is costly and time-consuming, people say, because the bank would have to renegotiate licensing deals with technology suppliers and swap out programs and applications for hundreds of thousands of bank employees. As one former employee explained: ""It's as if they stole the schematics to the Capitol - they can't just switch out every single door and window pane overnight."" The attack came after a recent turnover within JPMorgan's information security group. A number of staff members followed Frank Bisignano, JPMorgan's former co-chief operating officer, to First Data last year. This year, First Data agreed to pay JPMorgan over accusations that by wooing other executives to the payment processor, Mr. Bisignano had violated the terms of his former employment contract. By then, First Data had already hired JPMorgan's chief information officer, Guy Chiarello; its cybersecurity czar, Anthony Belfiore; its head of compliance, Cindy Armine; and Tom Higgins, JPMorgan's head of operation control. Anish Bhimani, the bank's chief information risk officer, remained. Mr. Bhimani, who is well respected in the cybersecurity industry, is a co-author of a 1996 book on cybersecurity, ""Internet Security for Business."" Ms. Lemkau said the bank was pleased with its current cybersecurity personnel. ""This is the highest-quality team we have ever had,"" she said. Last December, JPMorgan hired Dana Deasy as chief information officer from BP. Greg Rattray, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel who specialized in cyberdefense was named the head of information security in June. Challenges quickly followed. That same month, hackers found a way into the bank's systems.  Reporting was contributed by Michael Corkery, Nathaniel Popper, Peter Eavis and Jessica Silver-Greenberg.   "
U.S. Said to Find North Korea Ordered Cyberattack on Sony,"WASHINGTON -- American officials have concluded that North Korea was ""centrally involved"" in the hacking of Sony Pictures computers, even as the studio canceled the release of a far-fetched comedy about the assassination of the North's leader that is believed to have led to the cyberattack. Senior administration officials, who would not speak on the record about the intelligence findings, said the White House was debating whether to publicly accuse North Korea of what amounts to a cyberterrorism attack. Sony capitulated after the hackers threatened additional attacks, perhaps on theaters themselves, if the movie, ""The Interview,"" was released. Officials said it was not clear how the White House would respond. Some within the Obama administration argue that the government of Kim Jong-un must be confronted directly. But that raises questions of what actions the administration could credibly threaten, or how much evidence to make public without revealing details of how it determined North Korea's culpability, including the possible penetration of the North's computer networks.  Other administration officials said a direct confrontation with the North would provide North Korea with the kind of dispute it covets. Japan, where Sony is an iconic corporate name, has argued that a public accusation could interfere with delicate diplomatic negotiations for the return of Japanese citizens kidnapped years ago. The government is ""considering a range of options in weighing a potential response,"" said Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. The administration's sudden urgency came after a new threat was delivered this week to desktop computers at Sony's offices, warning that if ""The Interview"" was released on Dec. 25, ""the world will be full of fear."" ""Remember the 11th of September 2001,"" it said. ""We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time."" Hours before Sony canceled the movie, the four largest theater chains in the United States -- Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment, Cinemark and Carmike Cinemas -- and several smaller chains said they would not show ""The Interview"" as a result of the threat. The cancellations virtually killed the movie as a theatrical enterprise, at least in the near term, one of the first known instances of a threat from another nation pre-empting the release of a movie.  While intelligence officials have concluded that the cyberattack was both state-sponsored and far more destructive than any seen before on American soil, there are still differences of opinion over whether North Korea was aided by Sony insiders with knowledge of the company's computer systems, senior administration officials said. ""This is of a different nature than past attacks,"" one official said. An attack that began by wiping out data on corporate computers -- something that had been previously seen in South Korea and Saudi Arabia -- had turned ""into a threat to the safety of Americans,"" the official said. But echoing a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, the official said there was no specific information that an attack was likely. It is not clear how the United States determined that Mr. Kim's government had played a central role in the Sony attacks. North Korea's computer network has been notoriously difficult to infiltrate. But the National Security Agency began a major effort four years ago to penetrate the country's computer operations, including its elite cyberteam, and to establish ""implants"" in the country's networks that, like a radar system, would monitor the development of malware transmitted from the country. It is hardly a foolproof system. Much of North Korea's hacking is done from China. And while the attack on Sony used some commonly available cybertools, one intelligence official said, ""this was of a sophistication that a year ago we would have said was beyond the North's capabilities."" It is rare for the United States to publicly accuse countries suspected of involvement in cyberintrusions. The administration never publicly said who attacked White House and State Department computers over the past two months, or JPMorgan Chase's systems last summer. Russia is suspected in the first two cases, but there is conflicting evidence in the JPMorgan case. But there is a long forensic trail involving the Sony hacking, several security researchers said. The attackers used readily available commercial tools to wipe data off Sony's machines. They also borrowed tools and techniques that had been used in at least two previous attacks, one in Saudi Arabia two years ago -- widely attributed to Iran -- and another last year in South Korea aimed at banks and media companies. The Sony attacks were routed from command-and-control centers across the world, including a convention center in Singapore and Thammasat University in Thailand, the researchers said. But one of those servers, in Bolivia, had been used in limited cyberattacks on South Korean targets two years ago. That suggested that the same group or individuals might have been behind the Sony attack. The Sony malware shares remarkable similarities with that used in attacks on South Korean banks and broadcasters last year. Those intrusions, which also destroyed data belonging to their victims, are believed to have been the work of a cybercriminal gang known as Dark Seoul. Some experts say they cannot rule out the possibility that the Sony attack was the work of a Dark Seoul copycat, the security researchers said. The Sony attack also borrowed a wiping tool from an attack two years ago at Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, where hackers wiped off data on 30,000 of the company's computers, replacing it with an image of a burning American flag. Security experts were never able to track down those hackers, though United States officials have long said they believed the attacks emanated from Iran, using tools that are now on the black market. At Sony, investigators are looking into the possibility that the attackers had inside help. Embedded in the malicious code were the names of Sony servers and administrative credentials that allowed the malware to spread across Sony's network. ""It's clear that they already had access to Sony's network before the attack,"" said Jaime Blasco, a researcher at AlienVault, a cybersecurity consulting firm.  What is remarkable in this case is that after three weeks of pressure, the attack forced one of Hollywood's largest studios and Japan's most famous companies to surrender.  Many attacks have been aimed at stealing credit card data, like the intrusions on the Home Depot and Target networks -- and others at disrupting ATMs. An American and Israeli attack known as Olympic Games that targeted Iran's nuclear program was a rare attack on infrastructure. Sony has tried to put the best face on the situation, saying it understood that movie theaters had to be worried about the safety of their customers.  But the precedent set Wednesday could be damaging. Other countries or hacking groups could try similar tactics over movies, books or television broadcasts that they find offensive.  The cost of the assault was small: The attackers used readily available tools to steal data and then wipe it off Sony's machines. Representative Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who leads the House Intelligence Committee, said the hackers had ""created a backdoor to Sony's systems"" that they repeatedly re-entered to send threatening messages to Sony employees. The North Koreans have half-denied involvement, but have left open the possibility that the attacks were the ""righteous deed of supporters and sympathizers.""  But that leaves open the question of what to do about the Sony attack. The North is under some of the heaviest economic sanctions ever applied. A large-scale American cyberattack would require a presidential order, and Mr. Obama has been hesitant to use the country's cyberarsenal for fear of retaliation.  David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco. Michael Cieply contributed reporting from Los Angeles.  PHOTO: Sony dropped plans to release ""The Interview.""

Cyberattacks Rise as Ukraine Crisis Spills to Internet,"The crisis in Ukraine has spread to the Internet, where hackers from both sides are launching large cyberattacks against opposing news organizations. Security experts say that they are currently witnessing unusually large denial-of-service attacks,  also called DDoS attacks, in which hackers flood a website with traffic to knock it offline. The attacks have been directed at both pro-Western and pro-Russian Ukrainian news sites.  In at least one case, hackers successfully defaced the website of the Kremlin-financed news network Russia Today, replacing headlines and articles containing the word ""Russia"" with the word ""nazi."" Experts say the attacks on pro-Western Ukrainian news sites closely resemble the attacks on Chechnyan news sites, which security experts say are under almost constant siege. Matthew Prince, the chief executive and a co-founder of Cloudflare, a San Francisco company that helps websites speed up performance and mitigate  DDoS attacks, said in an interview Tuesday that while this week's attacks were similar to the attacks on Chechnyan news sites that use Cloudflare, it was not clear who was responsible for the attacks. ""I don't think it can be said that these are state-sponsored attacks,"" Mr. Prince said. So far, activity has not reached the levels of the cyberattacks directed at Estonia in a month-long online assault in 2007 that nearly crippled the Baltic nation. Nor have they reached the levels of attacks against Georgia in 2008 when - in the weeks leading up to armed conflict - servers hosting Georgian government, media, communications and transportation websites were knocked offline with a flood of data containing the message, ""win+love+in+Rusia."" Security experts said they had also not seen any indication that there had been a drop in traffic coming out of the Ukraine, which is what happened in Syria last year when Syria's access to the Internet was cut by what appeared to be the country's own government. While the majority of attacks this week were denial of service attacks, some websites were defaced or breached. Hackers defaced the RT.com site, replacing the word ""Russia"" with ""nazi"" which led to a flurry of inaccurate headlines such as: ""Putin: Nazi citizens, troops threatened in Ukraine, need armed forces protection."" The word 'nazi' has been increasingly thrown around as tensions escalate in the former Soviet republic. On Tuesday, Ukrainians marched with red flags featuring the banner of the fighter pilots who fought the Nazis in 1941. Meanwhile, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, speaking at a news conference Tuesday, described protestors in Kiev as an ""orgy"" of radicals and nationalists, highlighting a swastika armband he had seen in images of the protests.

Beijing Levels New Attack at U.S. Cyber-Spying,"A week after United States prosecutors indicted five People's Liberation Army officers on charges of cyber-theft, a Chinese government agency has issued its own lengthy, political indictment of American cyber-espionage, accusing the Obama administration of spying on the Internet on a scale far greater than that of other countries.  China's counterblast came in a report on Monday from the Internet Media Research Center, an arm of the State Council Information Office, which manages government press and propaganda, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. Although the report relied heavily on foreign news accounts of the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden's revelations about United States surveillance, it said that Beijing's own official inquiries had borne out Mr. Snowden's assertions that Chinese leaders and companies had been targeted. ""Several months of investigations by the relevant Chinese agencies have found that the parts about cyber-theft activities against China were basically accurate,"" the report said of Mr. Snowden's claims, according to a summary by Xinhua. ""U.S. monitoring operations have involved the Chinese government and leaders, Chinese companies and scientific research institutions, ordinary Internet users and many mobile phone users,"" said the report. The United States Justice Department alleged that five Chinese military hackers working in Shanghai infiltrated the networks of American corporations, and stole sensitive emails and industrial secrets. The Chinese government has responded by asserting its innocence and saying that the United States government has long used the Internet and communications interception to steal secrets. The report from the Internet Media Research Center, part of that public relations counteroffensive, was promptly featured on Chinese television and on news websites. ""Such conduct is a brazen violation of international law and a gross violation of human rights,"" said the Chinese report, echoing words that are often leveled at the Chinese government. ""This should be resisted and condemned by the entire world."" But the report may also be another worrisome signal of policy direction for foreign companies trying to do business in China's Internet and telecommunications sectors. It repeated claims that such companies went along with clandestine data collection by the National Security Agency. ""Surveillance cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and privately owned entities, especially with Internet service providers, has gone on for over six years,"" the Chinese report said, citing a Washington Post article from last year. Last Thursday, China's State Internet Information Office said it would require stricter vetting of companies selling Internet technology and services in sectors ""related to national security and the public interest,"" state media reported.

Bank Still Seeks to Assess Extent of Breach,"The headache caused by the attack on JPMorgan Chase's computer network this summer may not go away anytime soon. Over two months, hackers gained entry to dozens of the bank's servers, said three people with knowledge of the bank's investigation into the episode who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This, they said, potentially gave the hackers a window into how the bank's individual computers work. They said it might be difficult for the bank to find every last vulnerability and be sure that its systems were thoroughly secured against future attack.  The hackers were able to review information about a million customer accounts and gain access to a list of the software applications installed on the bank's computers. One person briefed said more than 90 of the bank's servers were affected, effectively giving the hackers high-level administrative privileges in the systems. Hackers can potentially crosscheck JPMorgan programs and applications with known security weaknesses, looking for one that has not yet been patched so they can regain access. A fourth person with knowledge of the matter, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said hackers had not gained access to account holders' financial information or Social Security numbers, and may have reviewed only names, addresses and phone numbers. The hack began in June and was not detected until late July. JPMorgan briefed financial regulators on the extent of the damage last week. Investigators say they believe that at least four other banks or financial institutions were also affected. ''We uncovered an attack by an outside adversary recently where the firm's technology environment was compromised,'' said Kristin Lemkau, a JPMorgan spokeswoman. ''We are confident we have closed any known access points and prevented any future access in the same way.'' Ms. Lemkau added that the bank had ''not seen any unusual fraud activity'' since the intrusion was discovered and said that there was ''no evidence that they have taken any proprietary software'' or had a ''blueprint'' of the bank's computer network. The fact that much is unknown about the extent of the breach has unnerved people within the bank, the people with knowledge of the investigation said, and has put JP Morgan, the largest bank in the United States, in a precarious position. Over the last month, JPMorgan has called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and outside security experts to investigate and remediate its systems. Kelly Langmesser, an F.B.I. spokeswoman, declined to comment. Given the level of sophistication of the attack, investigators say they believe it was planned for months and may have involved some coordination or assistance from a foreign government. The working theory is that the hackers most likely live in Russia, the people briefed said. They said the fact that no money was taken did not necessarily mean it was a case of state-sponsored espionage, only that the bank was able to stop the hackers before they could siphon customer accounts. The website for the JPMorgan Corporate Challenge, a foot race that pits employees of various companies against one another for charity, was also recently attacked. The site is maintained by an outside vendor, and it was unclear whether its breach was related to the bank's. After the Corporate Challenge attack, JPMorgan sent a letter to some website users saying that on Aug. 7, it had discovered that hackers had compromised login credentials and passwords. But the bank does not believe that the website attack was the entry point for the broader intrusion into JPMorgan's network. The Corporate Challenge website has been scrubbed of much of its information for several weeks. A message on the site says: ''We're sorry that other content on this website isn't available now. We're working on it.'' The attack on JPMorgan's systems came at a particularly sensitive time for the bank's security team. Last spring, Anthony Belfiore, the bank's chief information security officer, left JPMorgan for First Data, a payment processor based in Atlanta, following a number of other security specialists who had left JPMorgan for the company over the last year. It was not until June that JPMorgan brought in a new chief information security officer, Greg Rattray, a former commander in the United States Air Force who specialized in cyberattack defense. But by then, hackers had already found a way into JPMorgan's systems. Ultimately, those with knowledge of the investigation said, the breach was a close call, given that it was detected before hackers could pull out reams of data. Mitchell Silber, the former director of intelligence at the New York Police Department who is now the executive managing director at K2 Intelligence, a private investigation firm, said the troubling thing for the bank was that it was unclear exactly how much damage was done. Mr. Silber, whose firm is not involved in the inquiry, added: ''The question is, Have some other trap doors been left over that can be accessed?'' "
Another Security Fix Is Made to JPMorgan Chase's Race Website,"The website for the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge, which was hit by the same hackers that broke into the bank's own network this summer, is slowly crawling back to health.  Earlier this week, the small Michigan firm that manages the Corporate Challenge website repaired what it believed was the last potential security flaw with the website, said an executive with the vendor, Simmco Data Systems. David Simms, Simmco's president, said that the firm replaced a potentially compromised certificate for the website after confirming a report inThe New York Times last week that the Corporate Challenge website might still have an outstanding security flaw.  Certificates guarantee the identity of a website to a visitor's web browser. Using a stolen certificate, hackers can intercept any communications between a visitor and a website, including passwords. The website for the Corporate Challenge, a series of races that JPMorgan sponsors in cities around the globe to raise money for charity, has been largely inoperable since Aug. 7. The discovery that overseas hackers had infiltrated the website helped JPMorgan discover that the same gang of cyber criminals also had breached the bank's vast network. It is not clear why the potential problem with the website certificate was fixed only in the past few days. A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment. In early August, JPMorgan learned the Corporate Challenge website may have been breached because of information gathered by Hold Security, a Milwaukee security consulting firm. Hold found that a gang of hackers believed to be from Russia had obtained some passwords and email addresses used by race participants, who had registered on the Corporate Challenge website. JPMorgan ultimately found that the same hacker who broke into the Corporate Challenge website had gotten into the bank's network. The bank's security team determined that by finding the same  suspicious Internet addresses on the Corporate Challenge's server on some of the bank's own servers as well. The breach of JPMorgan's network, which took more than two months for the bank to discover, compromised some non-financial information about 83 million households and small-business customers. The bank has said the hackers did not gain access to more sensitive personal information, like Social Security  numbers or account balances, and that it had not seen any evidence of fraud involving the information that was taken, mostly names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. Mr. Simms, whose small company has been managing the Corporate Challenge website for about a decade, said he and the bank hoped to soon have the race website fully functional. He said, ""it will be the most secure race website.""                       "
Anonymous Member Claims to Have Hacked Dropbox,"A hacker claiming to be a member of the loose hacking collective Anonymous took credit for knocking offline the website of the cloud storage provider Dropbox late Friday. Attempts to reach the site were met with an error message.  ""We are aware of an issue currently affecting the Dropbox site,"" a company spokesman wrote in an email. ""We have identified the cause, which was the result of an issue that arose during routine internal maintenance, and are working to fix this as soon as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience."" Hackers said that the error was not the result of routine internal maintenance, but a security vulnerability in the website.  Hackers who call themselves AnonOpsKorea, a Korean offshoot of Anonymous, said one of their affiliates, using the Twitter handle 1775Sec, was responsible. In a post on Twitter, that individual said the attack was intended to avenge the death of Aaron Swartz, the renowned programmer and charismatic technology activist who committed suicide last year while facing a federal trial on charges of hacking into the M.I.T. computer network. The hacker claimed to have compromised Dropbox's site using a security vulnerability and threatened to dump Dropbox data if the company did not plug the hole that allowed for the site compromise. ""We are giving you time to fix your websites vulnerability. If it's not fixed expect a Database leak!,"" 1775Sec tweeted. By late Friday, there was no evidence hackers had released any customer data.  "
"After Reports on N.S.A., China Urges End to Spying","BEIJING -- The Chinese government called on the United States on Monday to explain its actions and halt the practice of cyberespionage after news reports said that the National Security Agency had hacked its way into the computer systems of China's largest telecommunications company.  The reports, based on documents provided by the former security contractor Edward J. Snowden, related how the spy agency penetrated servers owned by the company, Huawei, and monitored communications by its senior executives in an effort to discover whether the executives had links to the Chinese military. The operation also sought to exploit the company's technology and gain access to the communications of customers who use Huawei cellphones, fiber optic cables and network hubs. American officials have been working to block Huawei from entering the American telecommunications market because of concerns that its equipment could provide Chinese hackers with a ''back door'' for stealing American corporate and government secrets. Huawei, founded by a former People's Liberation Army engineer, has been largely frozen out of North America despite the company's insistence that it is independent of the Chinese government. The documents did not reveal whether the American spy agency had found evidence that Huawei was less independent than it claims. The news reports were published on Saturday by The New York Times and Der Spiegel, and the documents are included in a book by Der Spiegel, ''The N.S.A. Complex.'' As with Mr. Snowden's previous disclosures, the latest revelations about American cyberespionage are likely to complicate efforts by the Obama administration to expose and deter Chinese cyberespionage. Mr. Snowden told a Hong Kong newspaper last year that the spy agency had hacked into Chinese mobile phone companies and network hubs, including computers and servers at Tsinghua University, one of China's most prestigious schools. Those claims were not independently verified. On Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed ''serious concern'' over the news reports about the N.S.A. and Huawei, and he called on both countries to step up efforts to end the spying. ''We always believe that Internet communication technology should be employed for a country's social-economic development, rather than Internet espionage and monitoring,'' said Hong Lei, a spokesman for the ministry. ''China has also consistently advocated that the international community should work together to draw up relevant regulations to build a peaceful, secure, open and cooperative cyberspace.'' Reaction to the news reports was relatively muted in the Chinese state news media, with limited coverage on the nation's main news portals. The relative absence of invective may have to do with timing. Michelle Obama arrived here on Thursday with her mother and two daughters for a weeklong tour of China, and President Xi Jinping met with President Obama on Monday afternoon on the sidelines of the Nuclear Security Summit at The Hague.

Palo Alto Networks Acquires Silicon Valley Start-Up Morta Security,"Palo Alto Networks has acquired Morta Security, a 2-year-old Silicon Valley security start-up run by former employees of the National Security Agency and the United States Air Force.  Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed, though the deal marks the first acquisition of a company by Palo Alto Networks, a security company that went public in 2012 and has seen its shares jump more than 20 percent over the past year. The union is the second big acquisition of a security start-up in recent weeks. On Dec. 30, FireEye, a Palo Alto Networks competitor that uses software for cyberattack detection, spent over $1 billion to acquire Mandiant, a company that sends in teams to companies to help them recover from a hack and defend against future attacks. The acquisitions point to a greater recognition within the tech security market that there is no such thing as a silver bullet. Chief security officers say the old antivirus products no longer suffice and organizations now require a broad range of security products and services to confront increasingly sophisticated attacks. The research company Risk Based Security called 2012 a record year for security breaches, with the number of compromises more than doubling from 2011. Analysts expect that 2013 will be  another banner year once recent breaches at Target and Snapchat have been tallied. Morta Security tackles the most advanced security threats. Those threats, known within the security industry as ""Advanced Persistent Threats,"" can refer to nation-state sponsored cyber attacks against companies or government agencies, or persistent attempts by criminals to gain access to a high value target, like Target's cash registers. What they have in common is that traditional antivirus products often fail to detect them. Morta Security's exclusive focus on those threats attracted the attention of venture capitalists, notably Greylock Partners, Norwest Venture Partners and Andreessen Horowitz, which will all profit from Morta's sale to Palo Alto Networks, though neither company will say how much. ""In joining forces, we think we can reach a broader range of customers that we could have on our own,"" Raj Shah, the company's co-founder and chief executive, said in an interview Monday morning. Mr. Shah will continue to work at Palo Alto Networks as a director of marketing focused on advanced threats. ""We believe the antivirus market is hopelessly behind in being able to address the most acute problems,"" said Nir Zuk, the founder of Palo Alto Networks. ""That is not where the action is and that is not where the majority of the money is going to be.""  "
That '@' in Your Password for Better Security? Useless,"If you rushed to change your password last week on the heels of news that Russian hackers might have gotten their hands on an enormous amount of login information, go ahead and keep on panicking. Robert McMillan at Wired warns that even your weirdest-looking, hardest-to-type passwords may not keep you safe. For instance, he notes that just swapping out letters for numbers or special characters like @ doesn't really fool anybody anymore:  ""Some systems force you to chose an eight-character password, using capital letters, numbers and at least one number. That sounds pretty secure, but it's not. The word P@ssw0rd fits these criteria and password cracking tools such as JohntheRipper or hashcat will guess it in minutes. That's because they use something called 'mangling rules' which take dictionary words and substitute letters such as a for @ or s for $."" So websites that force you to use a number and a capital letter and an @ may not help you if they still let you get away with @Bc123. And even if you come up with a really great password (which, he says, is one that's close to random), it won't do you any good if hackers can just break in and read it: ""System administrators need to spend more time securing the passwords they store. If sysadmins had been taking care of business before the Russian hack - locking down their websites and protecting their users passwords with cryptography instead of storing them in plain text - users would be a lot better off."" And he quotes Cormac Herley, a Microsoft researcher: ""Why are we burdening users with demands to chose stronger and stronger things with the goal of withstanding increasingly sophisticated guessing attacks when 1.2 billion credentials are just spewed from servers that are improperly protected?"" While the meat of Mr. McMillan's argument - no matter how hard you try to create a good password, web services might just give it away with bad security - is certainly disturbing, average users may find a certain weird relief in it, too. For years, people have been telling us our passwords were bad and we needed to make better ones - now there seems to be a dawning understanding that just scolding people about the quality of their passwords might be neither effective nor sufficient. At MarketWatch, Priya Anand notes that efforts to force users to create better passwords can just make them give up: ""The more requirements websites add for passwords - to reach a minimum number of characters using uppercases, lowercases, and special characters, to avoid strings similar to previous passwords, to do a handstand while typing it in - the more likely people are to reuse passwords across accounts or create weak ones, researchers say. A 2012 study found that almost one-third of people have more than 10 unique passwords, and 38% of people would rather scrub toilets than try to come up with new ones."" Possible replacements for the password, she writes, include ""software that, invisible to the user, tracks contextual factors like time and location, and how users type, wiggle their mouses and swipe screens; and biometric scanners for faces, eyes, voices, veins and even heartbeats, often in combination with a designated mobile device."" She quotes Michael Barrett, a co-founder of a group working on new forms of security, who says that unlike passwords, efforts to hack biometric keys ""don't scale"": ""How many people can I attack in a day? Two or three? From a bad guy perspective, it's just not very interesting."" Viewers of ""Minority Report"" will remember that fooling an eye scanner, while disturbing, is arguably pretty interesting. And it's hard to imagine any form of security that would be completely impervious to cracking. Ms. Anand notes that two-factor authentication, frequently recommended as an improvement on single username/password combos, isn't ironclad either. And at The Verge, Russell Brandom uses a recently exposed flaw in PayPal's two-factor authentication system to discuss a larger problem with web security. He writes that a 17-year-old researcher found a way to get around PayPal's two-factor system back in June, and let the company know, but they did nothing. Now that he's posted publicly on the flaw, PayPal says it's being repaired - but, Mr. Brandom writes, ""it's not reassuring that, given two months of lead time, the company hasn't done anything to fix the issue."" He says this laxity is relatively common: ""It's hard to make software with no vulnerabilities, just like it's hard to make a door that can't be broken into. As security ramps up, diminishing returns set in fast. You could put a three-inch steel door on your house, but it would be ugly and heavy and you don't want to. Instead, you trust that no one will want to kick in your door."" Mr. Brandom notes that ""aside from once-in-a-generation bugs like Heartbleed, most security failures don't have much fallout, particularly for the companies that spawn them."" And in a separate piece at The Verge, he argues that the Russian hack is likely overblown. But in his analysis of the PayPal debacle, he writes that a devil-may-care attitude toward security can cause widespread problems even when it doesn't incite Heartbleed-level catastrophe: ""We're left with a relatively unprotected web where nothing is perfect and (as Quinn Norton put it) everything is broken. Heavy-hitters like the N.S.A. and China's Unit 61398 can buy up vulnerabilities and break into most systems, while anyone without a corporate security budget is left to fend for themselves. PayPal isn't the worst case - no one will die or go to jail over this bug - but it's one more example of why the world of security can seem so bleak. The problem isn't that we can't protect ourselves, but that we don't want to."" If hacks grow more powerful and widespread, individual users may start wanting to protect ourselves. But to hear Mr. McMillan tell it, we may not be able to. The flip side of a world where data breaches aren't our fault is, of course, one where we're powerless to stop them. And one where convincing companies to change their practices may be a lot more important than changing your password.                       "
WhatsApp Adds Encryption on Android Phones,"Facebook's WhatsApp, the popular messaging app, is getting a security upgrade. WhatsApp messages on Android phones are now encrypted all the way through the transmission process and on their own servers using respected, open-source encryption techniques developed by Open Whisper Systems.  iOS and other platforms are soon to follow.   The partnership is a coup for Open Whisper Systems, which is an offshoot of Whisper Systems, a company that developed secure text-messaging and encrypted calling apps like TextSecure, RedPhone, Signal and Flock.  Whisper Systems was acquired by Twitter in 2011, and Open Whisper Systems became a sort of loosely run, open-source project designed to create easier encryption standards that companies can use to create more private messaging.  WhatsApp boasts some 600 million users, making it a potentially juicy target for hackers looking to steal personal information or private photos.  And the app has had its share of security concerns, including complaints that, before 2012, all its messages were sent in plain text. That meant anyone could read them if they were intercepted (and intercepting messages is easy if, say, you're surfing on a public Wi-Fi network, for example).  WhatsApp did eventually encrypt its messages while they were en route between the sender and WhatsApp's servers. But they weren't necessarily encrypted there, which meant they were vulnerable to hackers, the company itself or government requests.  End-to-end encryption, by contrast, protects messages at every step. They're only decrypted once they get to the person they're intended to reach, and they stay encrypted on WhatsApp's servers.  ""This level of privacy has typically only been found in smaller, specialty security-focused software, so it's exciting to see it happen on this scale,"" said Moxie Marlinspike, the well-respected security researcher who co-founded Open Whisper Systems.  Google released an extension for Chrome in June that would provide this full-service encryption on some messages.  Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, said last spring that it would rely on third-party applications to provide end-to-end encryption in apps like Facebook Messenger, mainly because the encryption can be so complicated to use.  It often requires users to exchange public encryption keys, and raises questions about whether companies control the keys that could unlock messages on their own servers. And most people don't realize that when a service says messages are encrypted, that doesn't mean they aren't stored in the open on that company's servers.  Mr. Marlinspike said encryption would be turned on by default in WhatsApp as the encryption is unveiled, so users won't have to do anything to make it work. So, WhatsApp won't be able to read its users' messages, and someone who intercepts them can't read them without a decryption key.  And WhatsApp won't have access to those keys, so it can't read your messages either. If someone steals your phone, and you don't have a password on your device, they could still read messages you have stored there. But the new encryption makes it much harder for someone to spy on private messages.  Mr. Marlinspike wouldn't speculate on whether encrypting WhatsApp messages might be a backdoor into Facebook Messages or any other communications of the app's parent company.   But he said the goal was to create easy-to-use tools that any company can carry out to provide secure communications without having to become cryptographic experts themselves.  ""This has been really encouraging to us,"" he said. ""There are a lot of companies that are really sympathetic to the idea and if we just make it really easy for them, they'll do it.""  "
Bitcoin Is Not Yet Ready for the Real World,"Mark T. Williams, a former commodities trading floor senior executive and Federal Reserve Bank examiner, teaches banking, finance and risk management at Boston University School of Management.  It is understandable why some in the venture capital sector are over the moon about Bitcoin and its endless possibilities. Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz, has about 50 million reasons why he wants Bitcoin to succeed. The only problem is that Bitcoin is a concept dreamed up in the virtual world and is not yet ready for the real world.  Bitcoin technology and its lower-cost payment system design may be elegant but that does not mean it should be blindly embraced and adopted. The payment system and Bitcoin as an e-currency can't be divorced from each other. Before  Bitcoin becomes a regular and reliable method for consumer transactions, several significant risks need to be assessed and addressed:  Reputational Risk  Is Bitcoin an innovative response to facilitate meaningful commerce or simply a designer currency for the criminally inclined?  For Bitcoin to function as a currency, it has to be trusted as an honest means for transacting business.  Its reputation needs to be rock solid.  Since its inception, Bitcoin has been a decentralized experiment with a morphing purpose. In 2009, in response to the Great Recession, Bitcoin was seen as a way to take back control from irresponsible central bankers, reallocating power of currency to the people through computer code and a decentralized payment system.  However, creating an unregulated and untraceable currency also made it the currency of choice for those engaged in illicit activities.  The F.B.I.'s takedown of Silk Road in October 2013 significantly tarnished Bitcoin's reputation by exposing a deep web of drugs, guns, prostitution, assassins for hire and a ready tool for tax evasion and money laundering.   Trojan Horse Risk For the last five years, the pseudo name of Satoshi  Nakamoto has been used to symbolize the innovative genius (or team) behind Bitcoin.  Given that Bitcoin has mushroomed to $10 billion in value and prospects for commercialization abound, it is puzzling why this supposed e-currency messiah has not stepped forward. What if Satoshi Nakamoto is not real, and his likeness was manufactured by some cybercriminals to generate investor excitement?  At this embryonic stage it seems only logical that the true spokesman, not just someone from the venture capital industry, should step forward to part the waters, lead the followers and show the way.  Or at least be the industry face before the growing number of e-currency regulatory hearings that will help shape industry economics and future prospects.  Could it be that this coding genius is instead enjoying computer-manufactured riches on some remote, tax-free island, or is he a cyber-terrorist who upon Bitcoin adoption will activate a Trojan-horse virus to bring world commerce back to the Stone Age?Asset Bubble Risk The speculative mania generated around Bitcoin has created a hyper asset bubble that is ready to pop.  Since 2013, Bitcoin has risen from $13 to as high as $1,200 with price appreciation of more than 9,000 percent. There are 12.3 million coins outstanding, over 90 percent are hoarded, which helps to artificially inflate values.   Ownership is also extremely concentrated, increasing market manipulation risk. As prices have grown to the clouds, many Bitcoin millionaires have been minted along the way. But what supports these lofty prices?   Bitcoin is neither a legal entity, nor a start-up, and no stock is available for investors to purchase.  It has no management team, board, balance sheet, business plan or even a coherent vision on how to commercialize technology that has been given away in the market for free.  Even Mr. Andreessen, the venture capitalist, disclosed that he held only a de minimis amount of Bitcoin, making it clear that smart money is not betting on e-coins but directly on Bitcoin-related start-ups.   Increasingly, as Bitcoin investors gain greater awareness of what they actually bought (and more important not bought), values will fall further.  In the last month, Bitcoin has dropped by about 30 percent.  The bursting of the Bitcoin bubble will put in jeopardy the viability of the lauded payment system as it can't be easily separated from the use of Bitcoin as its currency.   Consumer and Investor Protection Risk Bitcoin is built around an unregulated, decentralized and untraceable coin. No legal protection is in place to assist consumers or investors.  If a consumer were to send a Bitcoin to the wrong e-wallet, if a hard drive storing coins were corrupted (intentionally or unintentionally), or an e-wallet picked, coin value is lost forever.  The chance of counterfeiting increases as the profit potential has risen. Already, of the e-coins outstanding, an estimated 4 percent, or $400 million, have been permanently lost.  As Bitcoin's value has skyrocketed, the amount of fraud related to stolen coins has increased.  Recently, it was reported that $220 million in coins were stolen and not recovered.  It is hard to track fraudulent activities and those who perpetrate these acts because e-coins are untraceable.  For Bitcoin to work and protect consumers and investors, there needs to be clear legal protection.  This will have to be implemented on a nation-by-nation basis with international cooperation. Without it, unacceptably high risk will persist and limit adoption.    Regulatory Risk Bitcoin's rapid price climb and growing visibility has also been its greatest weakness.  In the last month, some of the world's wealthiest nations have  realized that there are the numerous risks and the economic instability Bitcoin could pose if not properly regulated.  There are a growing number of nations that have begun to debunk the idea it could serve as a real currency.  China, the second-largest economy in the world, announced in December that it would not accept Bitcoin, and within 48 hours the price dropped as much as 50 percent. Other influential nations and authorities have also spoken out against Bitcoin, including Denmark,  Finland, France, India, Norway, Sweden, Thailand and the European Banking Authority. Next week, the New York State Department of Financial Services will hold an important hearing to further help clarify the role that Bitcoin should or should not play as it relates to our financial sector. Under this growing regulatory climate and concerns about not being able to prevent money laundering, American commercial banks are hesitant to open accounts with Bitcoin-related start-ups.  Increasingly, the fate of the commercial viability of e-currencies is moving into the hands of nations, their regulators and financial protectors and out of the control of Bitcoin enthusiasts.   "
N.S.A. Nominee Promotes Cyberwar Units,"WASHINGTON -- All of the major combat commands in the United States military will soon have dedicated forces to conduct cyberattacks alongside their air, naval and ground capabilities, Vice Adm. Michael S. Rogers, President Obama's nominee to run the National Security Agency, told the Senate on Tuesday. He said the activation of the long-discussed combat units would help counter the perception around the world that the United States is ''an easier mark'' for cyberattacks because it did not ''have the will to respond.'' Admiral Rogers's comments, in written answers to the Senate Armed Services Committee, amounted to one of the most detailed public descriptions of how the United States is spending billions of dollars to develop an offensive military capability to use cyberweapons. The committee must approve his simultaneous appointment as the head of United States Cyber Command, a job he will hold in addition to overseeing the N.S.A. The retiring head of the Cyber Command, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, first announced the creation of offensive and defensive teams last year.  During a two-hour appearance before the committee, Admiral Rogers also confirmed that the United States had seen evidence of cyberattacks on the new government in Ukraine, but declined to say whether the United States believed the Russian government was the source of the attacks, or how much damage was done. ''I believe we see it today in the Ukraine,'' he said of the reports of malware, apparently written in the Moscow time zone, that have shown up in Ukrainian government systems. ''We've seen it in Syria, Georgia. It increasingly is becoming a norm.'' ''Clearly, cyber will be an element of almost any crisis we're going to see in the future,'' he told the senators. At another point in the hearing, Admiral Rogers said he believed that both the United States and Defense Department systems were both still vulnerable to major attacks, and would be until ''a new architecture'' was in place to defend them. Admiral Rogers, currently the head of the Navy's Fleet Cyber Command, was cautious in what he said in the hearing about the future of the N.S.A.'s domestic surveillance activities, notably its collection of the metadata -- telephone numbers and durations of calls -- for virtually every call placed in the United States. He said he was only beginning to learn about their details since Mr. Obama tapped him for one of the most powerful job combinations in Washington: head of the country's electronic surveillance and code-breaking operations, and commander of its growing corps of cyberwarriors. But he rebuffed suggestions that the N.S.A. could track down terrorism suspects without having the telephone call data available in some form. And he sounded hesitant about the possible effects of Mr. Obama's initiative to put that information into the hands of a third party, expressing concern that it would slow the ability to track links among potential terrorism suspects. He said the trick was to ''query the data in a way that both protects the rights of the individual but also enables us to get answers in a quick, reasonable time period.'' He promised that the N.S.A.'s programs would become ''more transparent,'' and said he would ''assure a sense of accountability'' for the agency's activities. As usual for a public hearing involving the likely head of one of the nation's most secretive intelligence agencies, the most intriguing answers often involved what Admiral Rogers left unsaid, or said he was willing to discuss in greater detail in a classified session. For example, when Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, talked about a recent attack on the Navy's unclassified computer systems by Iran, Admiral Rogers acknowledged the attack -- and refused to say what country was behind it. ''It was a significant penetration,'' he told the committee. But the attackers ''did not opt to engage in any destructive behaviors,'' he said, suggesting that Iran's main motive was espionage. While many had expected Admiral Rogers to be grilled about the N.S.A.'s surveillance programs, he was spared that in part because he was testifying alongside Gen. Paul J. Selva of the Air Force, whom Mr. Obama nominated to command the United States Transportation Command, which moves military equipment and personnel around the world. In scenes reminiscent of the portrayal of Congress in the Netflix series ''House of Cards,'' senator after senator pressed General Selva to embrace, on the record, the importance of air bases in their home districts, ahead of a possible new round of base closings. Admiral Rogers, however, engaged a subject matter that rarely gets discussed in public: how to deter attacks on the United States. He said part of the answer was using ''the newest technology to identify our attackers before and during an attack -- not just after.'' Without referring directly to a secret N.S.A. program to place ''implants'' on computer networks around the world, so American officials could see attacks in the making, he said in his written answer that the United States could make it clear that it knows where attacks are coming from and is prepared to retaliate. ''This is within our capacity to fix,'' he said. "
Easier Ways to Protect Email From Unwanted Prying Eyes,"IT'S time to face reality: Pursuing digital security should be as much of a no-brainer as locking your door before you leave the house. Identity theft, corporate security breaches and an increased interest in personal privacy are forcing some changes. Many of us are choosing stronger passwords and changing them more often, locking down social media accounts and being more conscious of how we communicate. If you haven't taken these steps, you should. But one of our favorite forms of electronic communication -- email -- remains one of the hardest to secure. Security experts say email is a lot more like a postcard than a letter inside an envelope, and almost anyone can read it while the note is in transit. The government can probably read your email, as can hackers and your employer. What's the solution? Make your email more like a letter inside an envelope. The best way to do this is with a process known as encryption, which scrambles a message into unreadable code that needs a key to be unlocked, providing a layer of protection if someone intercepts your email.  The downside to encryption tools is that they are usually difficult to install and use. In addition, they require the person on the other end to be using the same tools. Thanks to a renewed focus on privacy and security, however, new tools are arriving regularly that should make it easier to encrypt email. One promising new encryption tool is Virtru, a feature that can be added to Chrome and Firefox browsers or installed on the Mail program on the Mac and for Outlook on Windows. One of Virtru's big selling points is that it works with web-mail services like Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail. There are also apps for iOS and Android. Another big benefit of Virtru is that recipients don't have to be using the service or any other encryption program to see your email. They receive an email that contains a link to your encrypted message. Once they click a button to verify their email address, they can read the unencrypted message in a separate web page and reply. Their responses won't be encrypted unless they also use Virtru, but your original email won't be included in the response, so it remains hidden from prying eyes. While Virtru is not a completely seamless experience, it is a walk in the park compared with some of the other options, which require signification coordination with the recipient of your messages. To install the browser plug-in, click the Get Virtru button on the company's website and it will detect what browser you're using. Click to download and the extension will install itself, all quickly and easily. You don't even have to restart your browser. (The company says support for Internet Explorer and Safari is coming soon.) The next time you compose a new email, you'll see a blue bar at the top of your email window with a little toggle button that lets you turn Virtru encryption on or off and access other options. Then, type your email normally and hit send. Emails and attachments are encrypted on your computer or mobile device and decrypted on the other side -- so-called end-to-end encryption, which means they can't be read in transit and they can't be decrypted without a key if they are intercepted. I particularly like that you can determine which emails you want to encrypt, case by case; and I like that it encrypts any type of attachment as well as normal email messages. The service also adds control over your emails after you send them: you can disable forwarding, for example, and even set messages to expire after a certain period of time. You can also revoke access to an encrypted message so your recipient won't be able to decrypt it in the future if the relationship goes sour. The methods aren't foolproof; someone can obviously still take a screenshot of an email once it's decrypted, or copy and paste the contents into a different file. And if your recipient writes back without encrypting the response, at least part of the conversation is not secure. Another drawback comes on mobile. You must use Virtru's app to compose and send secure messages on your mobile device, since it doesn't work on other mail apps on the phone. And there is one other aspect about Virtru that might make some people leery of the service: One of the company's founders, Will Ackerly, was a security engineer for the National Security Agency, the government agency that is said to intercept many forms of digital communications. Virtru promotes his background as a benefit. And John Ackerly, Mr. Ackerly's brother, a co-founder and the company's chief executive, says the company has taken pains to prove it is not tied to the N.S.A. Much of Virtru's code is open-source and has been published for peer review, giving the public a chance to look for potential vulnerabilities or back doors. Any Virtru product code that hasn't been published online is available for anyone who requests it, John Ackerly said. That doesn't affect the strength of its encryption; it's more like showing you the inner workings of a lock on a door. You can make sure the lock is strong, but it doesn't mean you can copy the key. In addition, the company is encouraging other companies or even individuals to set up servers that will store the encryption keys Virtru uses to decrypt emails. That would prevent all the keys from being stored in one place, adding another layer of security. When it comes to security, such distributed systems are generally safer. Although Virtru is relatively easy to use, it is not nearly the only option -- especially if you just want to send a single encrypted message, perhaps one that contains financial information. If you're looking for one-off encryption, try a site like InfoEncrypt, which says it encrypts messages in the browser without storing any information. With InfoEncrypt, you type a message, create a password and then encrypt it. Then, you copy the encrypted message and paste it into an email and send it to someone. This is a little onerous, though. In order for the recipient to open the message, the sender must also pass along the password, presumably through something other than email. Another one-off option is SafeMess, which works much like InfoEncrypt. But SafeMess lets you set an expiration time for your messages, ranging from three minutes to 90 days. Expect more simplified encryption tools soon. Google, for example, is letting developers test end-to-end encryption tools for Chrome and hopes to release them broadly in the near future. And a hacker, Nadim Kobeissi, is showing off a prototype tool, miniLock, at a hacker conference this weekend. The tool is a free, open-source browser plug-in that will let users easily encrypt just about anything. But for now, at least, a crucial part of email security might be recognizing that email shouldn't be used for your most secure communications. It's a hard thing to get used to, since we've used email for so much for so long. Security experts say it is easier to encrypt more temporary communications, like text messages (using a service like TextSecure) than far-flung and varied email systems. And whenever you think about secure communications, it's good to remember the safest method of all: talking face-to-face. "
Hackers Send Emails to Sony Employees,"LOS ANGELES -- As Hollywood snooped through yet another round of leaked Sony Pictures Entertainment documents on Friday, the studio and the F.B.I. publicly responded to a new threat from the hackers who attacked the company.  Sony employees, already badly shaken by the release of their personal information online in recent days, on Friday received an email from the hackers -- who identified themselves as the Guardians of Peace -- saying that ''not only you but your family will be in danger'' if unspecified demands were not met. The 202-word email was written in broken and somewhat nonsensical sentences filled with spelling errors. It added, ''What we have done so far is only a small part of our further plan.'' Sony released a statement confirming that ''some'' employees had received ''an email claiming to be from the G.O.P.,'' adding that it was ''working with law enforcement.'' The F.B.I. said in a statement that it was aware of the email: ''Recent events underscore the persistence and maliciousness of harmful cybercriminals, and the F.B.I. will continue to identify and apprehend those who pose a threat in cyberspace.'' Also on Friday, the hackers released a third set of Sony documents. Tens of thousands of Sony files have been leaked over the last week , including salary information, employee Social Security numbers and marketing presentations. Tabloid sites have been combing through Sony's leaked files and pummeling the studio with negative reports on the findings. The entertainment trade press has been more restrained, with editors weighing the ethics of accessing stolen documents. The always-ferocious Hollywood gossip mill has been in overdrive, as producers, publicists, agents, executives and assistants privately peer into Sony's suddenly public internal affairs. Sony and the F.B.I. have not yet identified the hackers, according to people briefed on the matter, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. One theory holds that North Korea was involved; Sony plans to release a comedy later this month, ''The Interview,'' that has drawn harsh criticism from the country because its plot turns on the attempted assassination of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. A North Korean diplomat has denied that the country was involved, however. Another theory involves a former Sony employee. One bright spot for the otherwise embattled studio: The viewing of trailers and online clips for ''The Interview,'' set for release on Christmas Day, has soared in recent days, according to Moviepilot, which tracks film-related activity online.

Suspicion Falls on Russia as 'Snake' Cyberattacks Target Ukraine's Government,"WASHINGTON -- Since the first major protests in Kiev that triggered the current crisis with Moscow, American intelligence agencies have been on high alert for cyberattacks aimed at the new government in Ukraine. They were a bit late: the attacks started long before President Viktor F. Yanukovych was forced from office, and as might be expected, no one can quite pinpoint who is behind them, although some suspicion is falling on Russia. According to a report published by the British-based defense and security company BAE Systems, dozens of computer networks in Ukraine have been infected for years by a cyberespionage ''tool kit'' called Snake, which seems similar to a system that several years ago plagued the Pentagon, where it attacked classified systems.  The malware appeared many more times this year in Ukraine, as the protests in Kiev picked up their pace. The protesters were angered by Mr. Yanukovych's decision not to pursue closer trade and political ties with Europe, which has been vying with Russia for influence in Ukraine. Snake -- also known as Ouroboros, for the serpent in Greek mythology -- gives attackers ''full remote access to the compromised system,'' according to the BAE report released Friday. BAE cited circumstantial evidence that the attacks originated in Russia, saying that the malware developers operate in the Moscow time zone and that there is some Russian text in the code. But American intelligence officials said that it was unclear if the use of the malware was state-sponsored, and that Snake was just one of many types of malware that Ukraine is battling every day. Versions of Snake's predecessor have been around since 2005, but the highly sophisticated one found in Ukraine appears to have been directed at government agencies. The attacks were aimed mostly at siphoning data from local computers to other servers, the report said. It identified 14 cases of Snake in Ukraine since the start of 2014, compared to eight cases in the whole of 2013. In all there have been 32 reported cases in Ukraine since 2010, out of 56 worldwide. One mystery is whether Snake is now being turned to purposes that go beyond mere espionage: manipulating or alerting computer networks in some way. Russian hackers -- both those employed by the state and those working on their own -- are known for their abilities to design sophisticated ''implants'' that both suck data out of a system and create a pathway for other malicious software to be injected. Documents stolen from the National Security Agency by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor now living in Moscow and interviews with intelligence officials indicate the United States also has extensive capability to do similar things. ''The usual Russian approach would be to design something that could both conduct surveillance and aid in an attack,'' said one senior intelligence official, describing how the National Security Agency and the Pentagon's Cyber Command were on the lookout for the kind of computer attacks that were unleashed on Estonia seven years ago. The precise origins of those attacks have never been completely understood. While some early reports about Snake compared it to Stuxnet, the American- and Israeli-designed worm that attacked Iran's nuclear program, the inner workings of Snake appear to be quite different. Stuxnet took over the computer controllers that ran Iran's nuclear centrifuges, spinning those centrifuges out of control. So far, there is no evidence that Snake can do that. American officials have never confirmed they were part of the operation against Iran, code-named ''Olympic Games.'' But what makes Snake particularly familiar to American officials is that they saw a version of it, then called ''Agent.btz,'' in the Pentagon's own systems. The event was written in about 2010 by the deputy secretary of defense at the time, William J. Lynn, who raised the alarm about the military's vulnerabilities to such attacks. In the four years since, however, the malware has become more powerful, and the BAE report described it as ''one of the most sophisticated and persistent threats we track.'' Snake has also shown up in Lithuania, Britain and Georgia, among other places. But the United States has only seen two cases so far, the BAE report indicates. "
"America, China and the Hacking Threat","Over several years of trying to persuade China to stop cyberattacks against corporate America, the Obama administration has gotten nowhere. What officials say is the most aggressive effort by any country to steal secrets from some of the most prominent and successful American companies is still going strong. Losses are estimated at billions of dollars in profits and thousands of jobs. In this context, the Justice Department's decision to indict five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for fraud is understandable as a feel-good gesture and seems within the parameters of American law. As a matter of substance, though, it is pointless and perhaps counterproductive.  The indictments reflect the administration's frustration with China's resistance to proposals that differences about cybersnooping be discussed through diplomatic channels and that rules of the road be worked out. To underscore American seriousness, President Obama raised the issue with China's president, Xi Jinping, at last year's summit meeting in California, but that seemed to have little effect. The 31-point indictment, in the works for two years, named members of Unit 61398, which was publicly identified last year as the Shanghai-based cyber unit of the People's Liberation Army. It alleged that since 2006, the hacking unit invaded the networks of American corporations, including Westinghouse Electric and the United States Steel Corporation, copying their emails and infecting computers with malware. Such behavior cannot go unchallenged. Hacking deprives firms of proprietary intellectual property that they have spent billions of dollars and countless hours developing. It compromises an Internet that depends on the free flow of information. Mr. Obama is always under political pressure, some of it no doubt from American corporations, to act tough with China. Still, the Justice Department's unprecedented legal action has serious weaknesses -- and is largely symbolic. It is hard to imagine, first of all, that the indicted men will present themselves in the United States for trial. The administration also has drawn a tenuous distinction between spying for national security reasons and spying on foreign companies for economic advantage, which it says must not be permitted. But America's own practices are a problem. As National Security Agency documents made public by Edward Snowden revealed, the United States regularly uses cyberspying to gain economic advantage in trade talks. Many other countries, including France, are also aggressive in spying to benefit domestic companies. The case has certainly gotten China's attention. The Chinese state media petulantly called the United States a ''mincing rascal'' for lodging the case. More substantively, the Chinese have called off the bilateral working group that was the only venue dedicated to cyberissues, and they have announced plans for tighter checks on foreign technology companies doing business in China. It would be unfortunate if China used the confrontation to withdraw totally from cooperating with the United States, especially on improving relations between the two militaries -- an effort that has just begun to gain traction. Tensions have already risen over China's aggressive moves in the South China and East China seas. China, as a rising economic power, believes that ferreting out the business secrets of foreign companies is a national security interest. One day, however, it will have its own pathbreaking achievements and will want to protect them. The responsible thing would be for China to work with the United States now to establish rules of the road that would reduce economic hacking and equip the two countries with strategies for reacting to cyberattacks during military-related tensions. Washington should make clear that the option for dialogue on cyberissues remains open, even as it pursues its legal case. "
The New Nigerian Email Swindle,"Call it the Nigerian email swindle 2.0. In the last three months, security researchers at Palo Alto Networks, the Silicon Valley-based security firm, have been tracking a series of cyberattacks affecting clients based in Taiwan and South Korea. The attacks, Palo Alto Networks said in a new report to be released on Tuesday, originate in Nigeria and are being orchestrated by some of the same people behind the Nigerian 419 swindle, in which fraud artists try to trick foreign victims into transferring money to their bank accounts.  The latest attacks, researchers say, are an example of how even unsophisticated actors can buy off-the-shelf hacking tools that allows them to spy on, and eventually steal from, victims without being detected by traditional antivirus products. The researchers said they have been tracking this particular criminal operation, which they call Silver Spaniel, for months. The attacks begin, as so many do, with a malicious email attachment. (Ah, yes, dear reader, yet another example of the dangers of wanton clicking.) Once clicked, victims inadvertently download malicious tools onto their devices; one, NetWire, is capable of remotely taking over a Windows, Mac OS or Linux system, and another, DataScrambler, makes sure the NetWire program is undetectable by antivirus products. Researcher said the attackers did not design the tools themselves, but got them from other hackers on underground hacking forums. DataScrambler can be leased for between $25 and $60, depending on how long criminals want to remain undetected as they record their victims' keystrokes. Palo Alto Networks said it had traced the attacks to criminals in Nigeria because many of them did not take steps to mask their I.P. addresses. In one case, the researchers said they had discovered a Nigerian who made repeated mentions of his use of the malware on his Facebook page, where his cover photo features a wad of $100 bills. The same person made comments about popular email frauds two years ago, the researchers said. ""In the past, the main target of Nigerian scammers has been wealthy, unsuspecting individuals, but the Silver Spaniel attacks thus far in 2014 indicate their target has shifted toward businesses,"" Palo Alto Networks noted in its report. Palo Alto Networks suggests a number of ways businesses can mitigate Silver Spaniel-style attacks: by blocking and inspecting attachments containing malicious files, for instance, and by blocking access to compromised servers that are noted in its report.

1988: 'The Internet' Comes Down With a Virus," This feature looks at the first time famous names or terms appeared in The Times. Have an idea for someone or something you would like to read about? Send a suggestion in the comments section.   It makes perfect sense when you think about it  - the first mention of ""the Internet"" in The Times came in an article about a computer virus.  Without a network, there would have been no way for a virus to go viral. In 1988, Robert T. Morris Jr., a 23-year-old graduate student at Cornell, created a virus that inadvertently resulted in the ""jamming of more than 6,000 computers nationwide in this country's most serious computer 'virus' attack,"" The Times reported on Nov. 5, 1988. Those computers, the article by John Markoff pointed out, were part of ""an international group of computer communications networks, the Internet."" What made the story all the more interesting was that Mr. Morris's father was the chief scientist for a computer security arm of the National Security Agency. Among other things, the virus, or worm, went after password files - and Morris's father created the computer password. The N.S.A. wanted to clamp a lid on as much of the affair as it could. Within days, the agency's National Computer Security Center, where the elder Morris worked, asked Purdue University to remove from its computers information about the internal workings of the virus. After being sentenced to three years' probation, the younger Morris went on to a distinguished career in computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is now a tenured professor.  Mr. Markoff, who with Katie Hafner detailed the case in a 1991 book, ""Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier,"" recalled the incident as an eye-opener. ""The significance of the Morris Worm was that it was the first event that brought computer networks to the attention of the broader American public,"" he said. ""Before that nobody realized their potential power in both good and bad ways.""                       "
Security App Lookout Attracts $150 Million in Venture Capital,"Lookout, a seven-year-old mobile security company in San Francisco, is riding a wave of concern over cyberthreats, with 50 million people using its security app. Now, the company has raised a fresh haul of venture capital from some major financial firms.  Lookout announced on Wednesday that it had attracted $150 million from investors led by T. Rowe Price Associates. Other investors include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the Wellington Management Company and Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment fund of Jeffrey P. Bezos of Amazon. A number of previous investors in the company - including the venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Accel Partners, Khosla Ventures, Index Ventures and Mithril Capital Management, which was founded by Peter Thiel - also participated. The presence of T. Rowe Price and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, two firms that serve wealthy individuals, could indicate that Lookout is at a mature stage. Young technology companies, when they are gearing up for an initial public offering, like to accept investments from such firms because they are seen as long-term investors that will not immediately sell shares in an I.P.O. ""These are very long-term, patient investors who are here to help us in building a multidecade franchise,"" said John Hering, the co-founder and executive chairman of Lookout, who until recently was the chief executive.  Lookout hired its current chief executive, Jim Dolce, in March. Mr. Dolce, a Silicon Valley veteran, previously founded four technology companies, including one that was acquired by Juniper Networks and another that was bought by Akamai Technologies. Mr. Dolce said that while Lookout had made inroads with individuals and some small businesses, he now hoped to convince large companies to sign up and put their employees on the service, especially given that more companies allow employees to use their own mobile devices for business. The new capital will help the company develop new products and expand its sales team, as it tries to crack the large business market, Mr. Dolce said. ""This financing, especially given its size, is a testament to what we're doing here,"" he said. For venture capitalists, Lookout has several promising sectors of growth. Its software is delivered over the cloud on a subscription basis, providing a predictable stream of revenue. It is also focused on mobile devices, which many technology experts see as the future of computing. Most important, it appeals to consumers and companies worried about malware, viruses and other threats. The app says it can block malicious websites as well as check which other apps are using a consumer's private information. And it includes a service to help consumers recover a lost or stolen phone. In the United States, Lookout has partnered with AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint, which offer the service to their customers. It also works with major mobile companies in Germany, France and Britain. With the latest financing, Lookout has raised a combined $280 million. Allen & Company was the adviser on the latest financing round.                       "
Middle Eastern Petrochemical Plants Are Targets of Hackers,"SAN FRANCISCO - Security researchers at IBM said they had uncovered a series of hacking attacks aimed at Middle Eastern petrochemical companies. The researchers, at IBM's Trusteer division, said the hackers were using a variant of financial malware known as Citadel, which was first discovered in 2012.  Citadel was originally engineered to steal victims' banking credentials by capturing their keystrokes and taking computer screenshots. But the researchers said that hackers targeting petrochemical companies have altered Citadel to add more functions: to take complete control over a victim's PC and allow hackers to gain access to a victim's corporate network. They have also made modifications in the malware to evade antivirus products and traditional security controls. Dana Tamir, director of enterprise market research for IBM's Trusteer division, and Diana Kelly, the energy and utilities lead for IBM's security systems, said their discovery was particularly disconcerting because petrochemical plants are a ""high-impact, high-value target."" By hacking into a petrochemical plant, the attackers could gain access to manufacturing processes that would allow them to affect a product, or in a worst case, cause a chemical explosion. Ms. Tamir and Ms. Kelly declined to name the victims of the attacks, citing an IBM corporate policy to privately notify victims but not name them publicly. They did say the targets included ""one of the largest sellers of petrochemical products in the Middle East, a major distributor of petrochemical products in the Middle East and a regional supplier of raw petrochemical materials."" The researchers said they had notified the victims and were analyzing the malware and its command and control center for clues to who was behind the attacks, but had yet to draw any conclusions. ""It could be a nation-state or a highly organized cybercrime group,"" Ms. Kelly said. At this stage, she added, ""We simply don't know."" Energy companies are increasingly a target for hackers. In June, researchers reported that Russian hackers had attacked more than 1,000 energy organizations in more than 84 countries since 2012. In many cases, researchers said, the method they used to hack companies also gave them the opportunity to seize control of industrial control systems, in much the same way that the United States and Israel were able to use the Stuxnet computer worm in 2009 to take control of an Iranian nuclear facility's computer systems and destroy a fifth of the country's uranium supply.

Malicious Software Campaign Targets Apple Users in China,"Researchers at a Silicon Valley security company said on Wednesday that they had found a new manner in which hackers can infect Apple products. The company, Palo Alto Networks, reported that it had uncovered a malware campaign called WireLurker targeting Apple mobile and desktop users and said it was ""the biggest in scale we have ever seen.""  Though the malware - malicious software designed to cause damage or steal information - is aimed at users in China and can be avoided, the campaign demonstrates new ways that attackers are targeting Apple iOS mobile devices.   The security company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said that WireLurker had infected more than 400 applications designed for Apple's Mac OS X operating system through the Maiyadi App Store, a third-party Mac application store in China. In the last six months, Palo Alto Networks said 467 infected applications were downloaded over 356,104 times and ""may have impacted hundreds of thousands of users."" The company said users' iOS devices could also become infected if they connected their mobile device to their Macs through a USB wire. ""WireLurker monitors any iOS device connected via USB with an infected OS X computer and installs downloaded third-party applications or automatically generated malicious applications onto the device, regardless of whether it is jailbroken,"" Palo Alto Networks security researchers said. ""This is the reason we call it 'wire lurker.'""  Typically, iOS users can download applications from third parties only if they have ""jailbroken"" their phones, or altered them to run software Apple has not authorized. With WireLurker, an infected application can reach a non-jailbroken phone from an infected Mac OS X system, which is why Palo Alto Network researchers say WireLurker represents a ""new brand of threat to all iOS devices."" Researchers say that once WireLurker is installed on a Mac, the malware listens for a USB connection to an iOS device and immediately infects it. Once infected, WireLurker's creators can steal a victim's address book, read iMessage text messages and regularly request updates from attackers' command-and-control server. Though the creator's ultimate goal is not yet clear, researchers say the malware is actively being updated.  ""They are still preparing for an eventual attack,"" said Ryan Olson, the director of threat intelligence at Palo Alto Networks. ""Even though this is the first time this is happening, it demonstrates to a lot of attackers that this is a method that can be used to crack through the hard shell that Apple has built around its iOS devices."" Mr. Olson said Palo Alto Networks had alerted Apple to its findings, though an Apple spokesman declined to comment on their reports. The firm's advice to Mac and iOS users is to avoid downloading Mac applications or games from any third-party app store, download site or untrusted source, or connecting an iOS device to any untrusted accessories or computers. They also advise users to keep iOS software up to date.  Separately, last Friday a researcher in Sweden announced that he had uncovered a serious new vulnerability in Yosemite, Apple's latest OS X operating system. The researcher, Emil Kvarnhammar, said the vulnerability, which he calls ""Rootpipe,"" allows attackers to gain ""root access,""or full administrative control, of a victim's Mac, allowing them to steal information or run programs of their own.  To date, there is no evidence that the vulnerability has actually been exploited and here, too, it would be difficult for the average Mac user to stumble upon. For hackers to gain control of a Mac, the victim would need to ignore every OS X pop-up security warning.  Apple is currently patching the Rootpipe vulnerability, but it is not clear when the patch will be completed.                       "
Malicious Software Said to Spread on Android Phones,"For years security researchers have warned that it was only a matter of time before nasty digital scourges like malicious software and spam would hit smartphones. Now they say it is has finally happened.  A particularly nasty mobile malware campaign targeting Android users has hit between four million and 4.5 million Americans since January, according to an estimate by Lookout, a San Francisco mobile security company that has been tracking the malware for about two years. Lookout first encountered the mobile malware, called Not Compatible, two years ago and has since seen increasingly sophisticated versions. Lookout said it believes, based on attempted infections of its user base of 50 million, that the total number of people who have encountered the malware in the United States exceeds four million. Criminals infect smartphones primarily by infecting legitimate websites with malicious code. When victims visit the site from their mobile phone, they inadvertently download the code, in what is known as a ""drive-by download.""   In other cases, the attackers sent spam from hijacked email accounts to their victims. That technique, Lookout's researchers say, successfully caused more than 20,000 infections a day. More recently, researchers say, attackers have been tricking their victims into installing the malicious code by disguising it as a ""security patch"" in an email attachment. In others, spam emails advertised weight loss solutions with a link that served up malware to Android users.  The attackers goal, researchers say, is to infect as many smartphones as possible and turn them into a so-called botnet, a network of infected devices that can be used by attackers for various malicious purposes. Lookout's researchers say there is evidence that Not Compatible's authors are renting out control of infected mobile devices to people who have used them to simply send out more spam or buy up event tickets in bulk from from Ticketmaster, Live Nation, EventShopper and Craigslist. Some have used infected devices to try to crack WordPress accounts. Lookout says the malware, now on its third iteration, allows infected devices to search for and communicate with other infected machines and share intelligence. Attackers also have found a way to encrypt communications between their command and control center and infected devices, which makes it more difficult to detect and decipher. The latest version, Lookout said, ""has set a new bar for mobile malware sophistication and operational complexity.""  All this malicious activity can be costly. The criminals are incurring data charges on phones that, ultimately, victims are held responsible for. As if that weren't annoying enough, researchers say the malware causes tremendous battery drainage. As with most malware discoveries, Lookout, the company sounding the alarm, has a stake in raising concerns about the security of mobile devices. Its mobile security application, which is available for both Apple's iOS and Android-powered smartphones, is able to identify the Not Compatible malware and keep it from infecting Android devices that have downloaded the Lookout app.                       "
North Korea Loses Its Link to the Internet,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A strange thing happened to North Korea's already tenuous link to the Internet on Monday: It failed. While perhaps a coincidence, the failure of the country's computer connections began only hours after President Obama declared Friday that the United States would launch a ''proportional response'' to what he termed an act of ''cybervandalism'' against Sony Pictures. Over the weekend, as North Korean officials demanded a ''joint investigation'' into the Sony attacks and denied culpability -- an assertion the United States rejected -- Internet service began to get wobbly. By early Monday, the Internet went as dark as one of those satellite photographs showing the impoverished country by night. Experts who monitor the health of the global Internet called it one of the worst North Korean network failures in years. But American officials who had described over the weekend how they were intensely focused on the country's telecommunications connections through China -- and how they had asked the Chinese government for help in cutting off the North's ability to send malicious code around the world -- declined to discuss what befell those connections.  ''I guess accidents can happen,'' one said in a very brief telephone conversation. A State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, told reporters on Monday, ''We aren't going to discuss, you know, publicly operational details about the possible response options,'' adding that ''as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen.'' There was no definitive way, at least in the short term, to determine whether the connection had been cut, overloaded, or attacked. And security experts cautioned that there could be many reasons for Monday's failure. North Korea could be pre-emptively taking its systems offline to prepare for an attack, some said. Chris Nicholson, a spokesman for Akamai, an Internet content delivery company, said it was difficult to pinpoint the origin of the failure, given that the company typically sees only a trickle of Internet connectivity from North Korea. The country has only 1,024 official Internet protocol addresses, though the actual number may be a little higher. That is fewer than many city blocks in New York have. The United States, by comparison, has billions of addresses. But when the sun rose in North Korea on Tuesday morning, the few connections to the outside world -- available only to the elite, the military, and North Korea's prodigious propaganda machine -- were still out. As the morning wore on, however, some of the connections began to come back after a blackout of nearly 10 hours, though there was still very little traffic, according to CloudFlare, an Internet company in San Francisco. Those connections to the outside world are managed by Star Joint Ventures, the country's state-run Internet provider, and almost all of them run through China Unicom, China's state-owned telecommunications company. They were not operative on Monday, but the causes could include a cyberattack by the United States -- something American officials have said they would be hesitant to do if it meant infringing on Chinese sovereignty. It is also possible China Unicom simply unplugged its neighbor. Internet monitors said a maintenance issue was unlikely to have caused such a prolonged failure. Doug Madory, the director of Internet analysis at Dyn Research, an Internet performance management company, said that North Korean Internet access first became unstable late on Friday. The situation worsened over the weekend, and by Monday, North Korea's Internet was completely offline. ''Their networks are under duress,'' Mr. Madory said. ''This is consistent with a DDoS attack on their routers,'' he said, referring to a distributed denial of service attack, in which attackers flood a network with traffic until it collapses under the load.If the attack was American in origin -- something the United States would probably never acknowledge -- it would be a rare attack on another nation's Internet connections. Certainly the United States is positioned to cause failures in many places in the Internet: Among the most interesting documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor now in Moscow, was a map of ''implants'' that the United States has put in strategic places, from network connections to individual computers, around the world. Those are most useful in cyberespionage, and the United States does a lot of that in China. Other Snowden documents showed that a major Chinese maker of network switching equipment, Huawei, was among American targets. So were leadership compounds and military locations. But there is no evidence that American cyberactivities in China have moved from surveillance to what experts call ''computer network exploitation'' or, the next step, actual attacks. And the Chinese themselves have been coy. China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said it was too early to know if Mr. Obama's accusation against the North concerning the Sony attacks was true, Reuters reported Monday. But she also said that China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, ''reaffirmed China's relevant position, emphasizing China opposes all forms of cyberattacks and cyberterrorism'' during a call on Sunday with Secretary of State John Kerry. While rare, disruption of computers and networks is certainly part of the American offensive playbook. During the Iraq war, there were periodic efforts to send fake messages to cellphones or computers to lure militants into traps. ''Olympic Games,'' the cyberattack on Iran's nuclear enrichment facility, was an extremely sophisticated attack that destroyed centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium. It was intended to slow Iran's progress toward a nuclear weapons capability. The United States has never acknowledged the attacks, and the central role played by Mr. Obama did not become clear until the summer of 2012, more than two years after the events. But a denial-of-service attack is far easier to arrange on short notice than a destructive attack. And it may be more akin to the ''cybervandalism'' that Mr. Obama spoke of against Sony. It is temporary, and while it imposes some costs, it would be limited in the case of North Korea because of the scarce availability of Internet services in the country. ''Proportional would mean that we would hack a North Korean movie company,'' said Victor Cha of Georgetown University, who handled North Korean issues in the George W. Bush White House. ''But that would not get you very far.'' Mr. Obama spoke Friday, during an interview with CNN, of the possibility of restoring the North to the list of state sponsors of terrorism. That, too, would have limited impact: The country is already among the most isolated on earth. But it is also not clear that cutting off Internet service, if that is what happened in this case, would slow North Korean hackers. Many are believed to be based in China. Sony's attackers used servers in Bolivia, Singapore and Thailand to launch their attacks. So any cutoff of Internet services would be mostly symbolic, a warning shot that two can play the game of disruption. "
"Criminal Software, Government-Grade Protection","The arms race between criminal hackers and targeted companies just became a little more military, with serious implications for business. Researchers at a software security company say they have found a popular type of criminal software inside an extremely sophisticated ""evasion code,"" which they say was previously used by Russia to spy on one or more Eastern European governments. The evasion software, written in a painstaking way to avoid most conventional detection methods, was most likely detached from its original program and sold to a criminal gang by someone in Russian intelligence, the company said.  Nonetheless, the finding underlines the increasing difficulty in extracting from a malware attack whether the assailant is government, criminal or simply malicious. Likewise, categories among targets, like military or business, are also blurred. ""This is a very fresh product, very expensive to use,"" said Tomer Weingarten, the co-founder and chief executive of Sentinel Labs, a Mountain View, Calif., company that announced the discovery. ""Even if they caught the malware, it would be hard to know how it got in your system."" The researchers named the malware Gyges, after the ring of Gyges in Greek mythology. Wearing the ring made its owner invisible. Sentinel, which published its findings in a white paper, said it initially discovered the malicious software in March, in the systems of one of its customers. Mr. Weingarten declined to name the company, but said it was in the technology industry. Since then, three more variants of the malware have been found. The payload delivered by Gyges is so-called ransomware, in which typically a computer is shut down and its data encrypted. The attacker then threatens to destroy the data unless the computer's owner pays up. ""With a good infection rate, it's a very cost-effective thing to do,"" Mr. Weingarten said. Ordinarily such software, which is commonly sold in online black markets, is discovered by conventional security methods, such as running the program through a ""sandbox,"" or isolated computing environment, before letting it touch a main system. In this case, the evasion code in which the ransomware was nested was written in such a way that it could detect a virtual environment, as opposed to the real thing. It also appeared to have been written directly in assembly code, a painstaking method that made it harder to detect and understand. ""I assume this took lots of guys and thousands of hours,"" said Udi Shamir, the head of research at Sentinel. ""It's really hard to reverse-engineer how this works. Going through conventional antivirus software, it would be marked benign."" Mr. Shamir said that after looking at Gyges a long time, he doubted the Russian government was directly responsible for the release of its sophisticated code. ""A few thousand dollars, in Russia that's a lot of money. I don't think Russian intelligence would want to sell something like this."" Such malware reports are usually issued both to alert the law-abiding community and to advertise the prowess of the company publishing the findings. Sentinel's report is no exception. Sentinel's software works by putting lightweight ""agents"" on top of new applications that come into a computing system, then watching, sometimes for days, for suspicious patterns. Once the suspicious activity crosses a threshold, Sentinel isolates the application so it cannot do further harm. In the case of Gyges, Mr. Weingarten said, Sentinel first detected behavior ""between benign and malicious"" from the evasion code, but did not really see a problem and isolate the malware until the ransomware began to operate. ""At that point, we started looking at the carrier code, and looking for similarities,"" Mr. Weingarten said. ""The ones we found were with government-grade software."" Like much corporate software, black market malware is increasingly sold online in bulk, leading to the term ""malware as a service."" Typically these ""build it yourself"" products are older versions of malware, and well known by security researchers. Whoever has Gyges, Mr. Shamir said, probably will not offer it to criminals on a broad basis anytime soon, since it is too valuable on its own. ""It took me hours, days to understand this,"" he said. ""It's really efficient, professional code. You wouldn't want to morph it and scale it out as a service.""                       "
Intrusion on Sony Unit Prompts a Shutdown of Messaging Systems,"LOS ANGELES --  While rivals focused on the holiday box office, Sony Pictures Entertainment spent Thanksgiving weekend coping with the continuing effects of a cyberattack -- and investigating what provoked the onslaught, including whether there were any ties to a coming comedy that has elicited the ire of North Korea. On Monday, a hacker group that self-identified on the company's computer screens as ''#GOP,'' for ''The Guardians of Peace,'' hijacked accounts, posted unflattering images of Sony's top two executives and claimed to have taken files with confidential information about the studio and celebrities who work with it.     The intrusion prompted Sony's motion picture group to immediately shut down certain computer systems, leaving the group without email or voice mail, functions that were still offline as of Saturday, according to people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Still, Sony's information technology experts told participants in a Saturday in-house conference call that they were making inroads and that systems were likely to be back online by Monday.   A studio spokeswoman, reached by text message, declined to comment.   Several Sony executives reached on Saturday were similarly tight-lipped, though one said the studio was exploring multiple causes and had no direct information to support a theory that surfaced on the technology news site ReCode on Friday: that the attack may have been retribution by North Korea for Sony's planned Christmas release of ''The Interview,'' an R-rated comedy about two American journalists who are recruited by the C.I.A. to kill the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.   Representatives for the Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security, all of which sometimes investigate digital crime, declined to comment.   One person with knowledge of the situation said a Hollywood executive from a company other than Sony had contacted Homeland Security to suggest that the attack might be related to a piracy investigation involving a movie that was not even made by Sony. But the department was not mobilized as a result of the query.   The attack apparently did not use sophisticated techniques that might be expected from a hostile government. Rather, it employed a common form of so-called ransomware,  according to a security researcher with knowledge of the breach, who did not have permission to speak publicly about the findings.   In ''The Interview,'' a blundering television host played by James Franco and his equally idiotic producer (Seth Rogen) are recruited to assassinate Mr. Kim. This year, apparently after seeing a trailer, a spokesman for North Korea's Foreign Ministry called the film ''the most undisguised terrorism and a war action.''   He added: ''If the U.S. administration connives at and patronizes the screening of the film, it will invite a strong and merciless countermeasure.''   Originally scheduled for release in October, the film has undergone changes in postproduction that some Hollywood trade publications have interpreted as caution in response to North Korea's statements. Sony executives have privately said the edits were entirely intended to make the movie funnier.   On Friday, a North Korean government website, Uriminzokkiri, called ''The Interview'' an ''evil act of provocation.''   Mr. Kim has lately inspired an increasing number of professional and amateur entertainers, to the ire of North Korean authorities. In July, an online video that affixed Mr. Kim's head to dancing bodies went viral in China, prompting takedown attempts by North Korean officials, according to South Korean media outlets.   In September, North Korea took issue with a British television drama, ''Opposite Number,'' that cast a negative light on the country's nuclear program. Officials called the program ''malignantly slandering'' and ''despicable burlesque'' orchestrated with the ''tacit connivance'' of the British government.   Mr. Rogen, who helped direct ''The Interview'' and has a writing credit on its script, has seized the country's displeasure as a publicity tool. ''People don't usually wanna kill me for one of my movies until after they've paid 12 bucks for it,'' he wrote on Twitter, in a message that was reposted by 7,600 people.   But Sony executives have pointedly sidestepped any attempt to connect the film with the intrusion.    Hackers have repeatedly targeted Sony over the years, although the major attacks, until now, have been aimed at the technology and entertainment conglomerate's PlayStation video game network. In 2011, hackers stole data belonging to 77 million PlayStation users; in August, a group calling itself the Lizard Squad crashed the network with a more modest ''denial of service'' attack.   The disruption came at a relatively quiet time for Sony. The studio's last movie, ''Fury,'' was released on Oct. 17, and its next film, a remake of ''Annie,'' does not arrive until Dec. 19.    Sony also operates a substantial television business from its lot in Culver City, Calif. Its programs include chestnuts like ''Jeopardy'' and ''Wheel of Fortune,'' along with ''The Goldbergs,'' a comedy on ABC, and ''The Blacklist,'' the hit NBC drama. The attack did not affect Sony's music divisions.   Many Sony employees simply shifted to personal email accounts or began relying on smartphones. On Saturday morning, for instance, a publicist distributed the studio's standard weekend box office report to news outlets using a Gmail address.    ''As always, please call with questions,'' the note concluded.    "
Keeping Confidential Personal Data Out of Hackers' Hands,"The numbers sound abstract: hundreds of millions of email addresses and other types of personal identification found in the hands of Russian hackers. For people worried that they are caught in the mix, however, the discovery by Hold Security of a huge database of stolen data is highly personal. But personal doesn't mean helpless. There are common-sense steps everyone can take to keep the impact of hackers to a minimum.  Q. How do I know if my personal information is part of the stolen material? A. Assume it is. The latest breach is enormous, and similar attacks and smaller thefts are happening all the time. Hold Security is creating a tool to allow consumers to see whether their records have been stolen, but the company is not certain when it will be ready. At this point, it is wisest to improve your online security immediately. Q. Let me guess: I should change my password? A. The first step, as always, is to change passwords for sites that contain confidential information like financial, health or credit card data. Do not use the same password across multiple sites. Q. How do I create stronger passwords? A. Try a password manager like LastPass, or Password Safe, which was created by the security expert Bruce Schneier. These services create a unique password for each website you visit and store them in a database protected by a master password that you create. That sounds dangerous, but password managers reduce the risk of reused passwords or those that are easy to decode. If you must create your own passwords, make sure they are not based on dictionary words. Even a word obscured with symbols and numbers can be cracked relatively quickly. Mr. Schneier suggests creating an anagram from a sentence, and using symbols and numbers to make it more complicated. For example, the sentence ''One time in class I ate some glue'' could become ''1TiC!AsG.'' Create the strongest passwords for the sites that contain the most sensitive information and do not reuse them anywhere. Q. Are passwords enough? A. Passwords are not enough. If a site offers additional security features like secondary or two-factor authentication, enable them. Then, when you enter your password, you'll receive a message (usually a text) with a one-time code that you must enter before you can log in. Many bank sites and major sites like Google and Apple offer two-factor authentication. In some cases, the second authentication is required only if you're logging in from a new computer. Q. How can I stop my information from being stolen in the first place? A. Increasingly, you cannot. Regular monitoring of financial records can help minimize the damage if someone gets your information. But only the companies storing your personal data are responsible for securing it. Consumers can slow down hackers and identity thieves, but corporate computer security and law enforcement are the biggest deterrents. "
Augmenting Your Password-Protected World,"A USERNAME and password combination has long been the standard security mechanism for online accounts. But that method just isn't cutting it anymore. Huge data breaches, in which hackers gain access to personal information, have risen sharply in the last few years. And consumers have named identity theft their No. 1 online concern for 14 consecutive years, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Sometimes, our existing security infrastructure can't protect us, like when our personal data is stored in vulnerable databases. But all too often, we're our own worst enemy. Our own weak passwords make it all too easy for hackers to guess them; we use the same passwords for multiple sites, offering thieves a sort of skeleton key. And even when we're told about data breaches, we don't always respond by changing passwords or any other behaviors. The reality is, passwords don't look to be leaving us anytime soon. Still, there are some new and interesting tools to help make our password-protected world a little safer.  Many of the most ambitious and promising technologies are coming in the realm of biometrics -- that is, using some physical part of yourself like your voice, fingerprint, facial recognition or an iris scan. Biometric security systems have long been promised. Those promises have started to become reality in recent years, and really became mainstream with the introduction of a fingerprint reader in iPhones last year. Now, people with the latest iPhones can unlock their phones, authorize purchases from iTunes and other apps and even pay at some stores by just touching their finger to their phone. The phone reads the person's fingerprint and approves the payment. ''It used to be a fingerprint sensor had to connect with a USB cable and you'd pay hundreds of dollars,'' said Hector Hoyos, the chief executive of Hoyos Labs, a biometric security start-up. ''Now it's on your iPhone.'' This month, Mr. Hoyos's company will release 1U, an app that uses facial recognition to log people into various accounts. The app starts at $30 a year; the price can go up depending on how many websites and devices you connect to it. The app doesn't replace passwords entirely. To use it, you must first log into each online service, like your bank or email account or Facebook, while in the app. When you want to log into one of those services in the future, you visit the site through the app and have 1U scan your face with your phone's camera. If the scan is successful, the app logs you in as though you had typed in your password. Because you don't need to remember your passwords when using the app, you can set a unique and sophisticated password for each service in the first place. In addition, the app allows you to set various levels of security for different accounts. You can choose to have the app scan your face quickly for one account, for example, and do a ''liveness'' test, which will force you to move your eyes and smile before you can log in, for another account. The app can connect with your computer, too, so when you want to log in to sites there, you can glance at your phone for a facial scan instead of entering your password. The phone sends an encrypted message to the computer authorizing the login. The experience isn't perfect: For one thing, you have to go to the sites through the 1U app instead of the apps or the browser you usually use. And looking at your phone to log into a website on your computer is clunky. In addition, using 1U won't protect you from a situation in which your username and password are stolen from some other service that you use, like your bank or a store where you shop online. But it may encourage you to have different, and strong, passwords for each service, limiting the potential damage. In any case, your biometric information, encryption credentials and other personal information should be safe. They are stored only on your phone, Mr. Hoyos said. In the future, Mr. Hoyos hopes that companies will stop using passwords altogether, eliminating the risk of having login credentials stored on external servers. Other companies are following a similar path: Making biometric add-ons that work with existing password systems while trying to persuade companies to make a wholesale change. EyeLock, a start-up in New York, just released Myris, a USB-connected iris scanner that costs $280. The iris is one of the most unique human identifiers, as no two are alike. Anthony Antolino, the chief marketing officer for EyeLock, said the company was working with companies like Bank of America and had already incorporated its iris scanning technology into some of its buildings. As for the Myris device, it's essentially an extremely high-tech password manager. Like the 1U app, it doesn't replace your passwords, it just replaces the need to enter them when you're logging in to a site or to your computer. Unlike 1U, though, the Myris software can create new, secure passwords for you and save them so you don't have to remember them, the way that password manager programs like LastPass do. And it can import saved passwords from programs like LastPass. All those new passwords, and your iris information, is stored on Myris's colorful hockey puck-shaped device that you plug into your computer. That's a warning, too: If you lose your device, there's no getting that information back. You'll have to tediously change every password. Myris is easy to set up. It has a small mirror on its underside, which you stare at while sensors on the device read each eye. After the initial setup, you set up your online accounts using the accompanying EyeLock software. Using the iris scanner is fun and futuristic, and logging into services is fast -- it takes about a second. There are multiple downside, though. One is that Myris doesn't work on mobile devices. Another is that you have to have the device attached to your computer. And as with 1U, if your password is compromised from a company's servers, you're out of luck. Still, using Myris should give you more security than entering a password on your own. Using the scanner will eliminate keylogging, which happens when malware on your computer reads your keystrokes and gleans your password. And using a password manager at all, especially an iris-based one, reduces the likelihood that you'll repeat your passwords or that you'll create easy-to-guess ones. If these two new products don't excite you, rest assured that biometrics are almost surely headed your way soon. Brett Beranek, the director of product strategy for voice biometrics at Nuance Communications, which makes voice-recognition software and technologies, said most consumers would begin to encounter some kind of biometric systems in the next few years. In the last three years, he said, Nuance has gone from 10 million enrolled users to 45 million, as companies like Vanguard, Barclays, T-Mobile and U.S. Bank have incorporated its voice authentication technology. What remains unclear, though, is whether there will be one preferred method of biometric authentication: fingerprint, iris scanning, voice authentication or facial recognition. And companies will have to make sure that whatever they store on their servers can't be stolen en masse. Once those decisions are made, though, biometric readers could be here to stay. ''The technology and the knowledge to implement a solution to completely eradicate usernames and passwords exists today and we have it and it is safe and convenient,'' Mr. Hoyos said. ''At what speed corporations adopt it is a different matter.'' "
Cyberespionage Attacks Tied to Hackers In Iran,"SAN FRANCISCO - An elaborate, three-year cyberespionage campaign against United States military contractors, members of Congress, diplomats, lobbyists and Washington-based journalists has been linked to hackers in Iran. The campaign compromised the computers of some 2,000 victims and went unnoticed since 2011, according to a report to be released Thursday by iSight Partners, a computer security firm in Dallas. American intelligence officials have long said Iranian hackers are a serious threat, not for their technical skills, but because of the country's vow to retaliate for Stuxnet, the computer virus created by the United States and Israel and unleashed on an Iranian nuclear site. But the skills of Iranian hackers were not believed to be on par with hackers in Russia and China.  The new report suggests that the Iranian skills gap may be closing. ""This marks the emergence of Iran on the cyberespionage landscape,"" said John Hultquish, the head of cyberespionage intelligence at iSight Partners. The report details elaborate attacks by a group that has been able to flourish, largely unnoticed. The campaign, called ""Newscaster"" by iSight Partners researchers, employed ""social engineering."" Hackers used a dozen fake personas and connected with victims over Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube. They sent their targets malicious links, which downloaded malware onto their machines, or directed them to fake login screens to steal the usernames and passwords. Among the fake personas employed by the hackers were the names of real journalists. In one case, hackers purported to be Sandra Maler, a Reuters reporter. In others, they claimed to be employees at military contractors, a tax adviser and reporters for NewsOnAir.org, a fake news organization set up by the hackers. They tried to make the site look legitimate by copying and posting news articles and swapping out the real bylines with one of the fake names. Hackers gave their personas Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, LinkedIn profiles and interacted with one another, even posting news about the death of a family dog. A hacker managing another persona also used social media platforms to publicize a personal blog about depression, aptly titled ""My Loneliness."" ""The fact that this has gone largely unnoticed for three years suggests they've been very successful in this approach,"" said Tiffany Jones, iSight Partners' senior vice president. Both Ms. Jones and Mr. Hultquist described the effort as the ""most elaborate social engineering campaign"" they had seen. The iSight report did not say what types of data hackers were able to steal, but Ms. Jones said the list of targets, particularly military contractors, raised concerns that the hackers were after plans for military weapons systems. There were many clues. The fake NewsOnAir.org website was registered in Tehran and sites that hackers used to deploy their malware were also hosted in Iran. The malware that the hackers used contained several Persian words. The time stamps of hackers' activity tracked with professional working hours in Tehran. They even took the day off on Iranian weekends and holidays. Another telltale sign, researchers said, was the content the hackers posted on their personas' social media. In some cases, they posted Iranian jokes to their Facebook pages. One hacker used a Facebook page to ask followers, ""What's kind of sanction will lead to undermining the Iranian nation?"" ISight researchers said that because the attacks targeted victim's personal profiles, much of the malicious activity occurred beyond the watch of their employers at defense contractors, lobbying firms, media outlets and Congress, allowing the attackers to operate undetected for so long. ""This is a particular threat that can't be seen and operates outside the perimeter of the enterprise,"" Ms. Jones said. That kind of stealth hasn't been seen in other attacks attributed to Iranian hackers, who in the past have been connected to blunt attacks meant to slow down or shut down banking sites. Iranian hackers are also believed to have infected 30,000 computers belonging to Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, replacing their contents with an image of a burning American flag. And last year, American officials said Iranian hackers were behind a wave of attacks on several American oil, gas and electricity companies,that officials described as probes looking for ways to disrupt critical processing systems. But the stealth of the Newscaster campaign, which continues, suggests Iranian hackers are not just set on business disruption, the researchers said. Now they are also aiming to steal intellectual property and military and trade secrets. "
Using the 'Public' Network Option,"Precautions in Using A Public Network Q. I've recently moved to a hotel complex that offers free Wi-Fi to residents, guests and health club members who use its facilities. The network password is known to all who come in the door. How secure is my computer if I choose the ''Public Network'' setting in Windows 7? A. The ''Public'' network-location setting has the built-in Windows Firewall program block certain programs and services from running when you are connected. The setting also turns off file sharing and the network discovery feature that lets you see other computers and devices on the network -- and for those other computers and devices to see you.  While the ''Public'' option does offer the most security available within Windows 7, it is still good to be careful what you do when connected to the hotel's network -- especially if the password is known to everyone using the facilities. Keep in mind that you are not acquainted with all the other network users, nor do you really know the full security practices used by the hotel itself. Before connecting, make sure your Windows 7 system is fully up to date with the latest security patches. If you are running a third-party Internet security suite like Norton or AVG, check that it has all the latest updates too. Connecting to the Wi-Fi network through a virtual private network (V.P.N.) program that encrypts your Internet data traffic adds another layer of protection. If you do not have access to a V.P.N. through work or home, services like Hotspot Shield, OpenVPN or ProXPN are available.

Is it possible to see date and time stamps on photos taken on iPhone? A. Several inexpensive programs in the App Store can add date and time stamps to the photos in your iPhone's Camera Roll, and some can add location information as well. Date 1 or All, Context Camera and DateCam are among the many choices. If you have it, Apple's iPhoto app for iPhone displays a selected picture's date and time when you tap the ''i'' icon in the toolbar; other third-party photo apps have a similar feature. You can also view dates and times on picture file if you import them into the computer and view each image's properties with a program like Picasa or the desktop version of iPhoto. TIP OF THE WEEK If you like to relax by watching YouTube videos in your computer's web browser at home (or work), a few handy keyboard shortcuts help you control the player window without having to fumble for the mouse. For example, when you have the video window active on the screen, tapping the keyboard's space bar pauses (or resumes playing) the clip. You can also use keys to jump around in a selected video. Tapping the left or right arrow keys skips a few seconds backward and forward through the clip. Pressing the numbers on the top row of the keyboard moves you to a corresponding percentage within the video's total playtime: Press the 5 key to jump to the 50 percent playback mark of the clip, 3 to go to the 30 percent or 8 to go to 80 percent of the clip's total time. Want to play the whole thing again? Just press the 0 (zero) key to go back to the beginning. J.D.

Censors Hit Delete on a Party Chief's Censorship Remarks,"The question runs through the minds of many Chinese microblog users: What catches the eye of an online censor on any given day? It seems that comments on microblogs about Internet censorship, even by senior Communist Party officials, can fall prey to the delete button. On Thursday, the microblog account of Caijing, a respected news magazine, posted a statement that Zhang Chunxian, the party chief of Xinjiang, the troubled western region, had made to journalists in Beijing earlier that day. Mr. Zhang had been asked by reporters after a meeting of the National People's Congress about the rising number of violent episodes in Xinjiang, often involving ethnic Uighurs, who are Turkic-speaking Muslims, and the majority ethnic Han.  Mr. Zhang said that 90 percent of ""violent terrorists"" use a VPN, a virtual private network, to get around China's Internet censorship system and watch videos that inspire them to carry out attacks. The censorship system, often called the Great Firewall, blocks a wide range of websites, including ones with political content deemed sensitive, but it can be circumvented. On its microblog, Caijing posted Mr. Zhang's statement above his photograph. The post went up around 8:30 p.m. Thursday. But by Friday, it had been deleted, along with the 27 users' comments under it, according to Free Weibo, an organization that documents Internet censorship in China. The Caijing microblog is hosted by Sina Corp., which has a popular microblog platform. Sina and other companies that run microblog platforms employ armies of internal staff censors to monitor posts and delete ones they deem too sensitive so that the companies will not incur the wrath of party officials. But censors elsewhere did not seem bothered by Mr. Zhang's remarks. On Friday, Caijing's own website carried an article about his comments, without any apparent objection from party censors. The article had first appeared in Jinghua Times, a Beijing newspaper, and was reprinted on the websites of both Caijing and the Chinese-language edition of Global Times, a state-run newspaper that strikes a nationalistic tone. The English-language website of Global Times ran its own article on Mr. Zhang's remarks under the headline, ""Terrorist attacks 'part of trend.'"" That headline raises interesting questions in light of other articles by Global Times this week. Global Times did not explain in its article quoting Mr. Zhang why it had put the phrase ""part of trend"" in quotation marks in the headline. Some readers might interpret the use of the quotation marks to mean that the newspaper was skeptical of Mr. Zhang's judgment. Earlier this week, Global Times and other state news organizations angrily accused CNN, the American television news network, of undue skepticism over the Chinese government's explanation of a deadly knife attack in the city of Kunming because the headline on a CNN online article had the word ""terrorists"" in quotation marks. The state media editorials criticizing CNN have fanned distrust of Western journalists among many Chinese. The editorial in Global Times, which ran on Monday, said: ""CNN has tiptoed around the Kunming attack by putting quotation marks around the word terrorists. Its long-claimed neutrality hinted at its partiality to terrorists."" ""It is more than obvious that the latest incident is a terrorist attack and there is no room for their double standards,"" it added. ""CNN is messing with political ideologies and has crossed the bottom line of media ethics.""   Bree Feng contributed research. "
No Access to Mt. Gox Site,"The website of Mt. Gox, the troubled Bitcoin exchange, appears to have been taken down, shortly after six other major Bitcoin exchanges released a statement distancing themselves from Mt. Gox.  The home page of the site, based in Tokyo, could not be entered during Tuesday afternoon in Asia, and no error message appeared. Bitcoin exchanges allow their users to trade Bitcoins for dollars and other currencies. This month, Mt. Gox -- once the largest exchange handling Bitcoins -- said it was halting withdrawals indefinitely after it detected ''unusual activity.'' ''This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was the result of one company's actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of Bitcoin and the digital currency industry,'' the other exchanges -- Bitstamp, Blockchain, BTC China, Circle, Coinbase and Kraken -- said in the statement. Mt. Gox was not immediately available for comment. ''As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today,'' the companies said. ''Mt. Gox has confirmed its issues in private discussions with other members of the Bitcoin community.'' On Sunday, Mark Karpeles, the chief executive of Mt. Gox, resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation in a blow to the digital currency. It was a founding member of the foundation and had one of the three elected industry representatives on the board. The resignation followed a number of technical problems, including a huge cyberattack from unknown sources that has sent a barrage of spam to Bitcoin exchanges. ''There are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in Bitcoin,'' the six exchanges said in the statement. ''These companies will continue to build the future of money by making Bitcoin more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants.'' "
The Bitcoin Blasphemy,"Whenever I read a story about bitcoin, the virtual currency that has been so much in the news these days, I think about a man named Dee Hock. In the early 1970s, Hock created the credit card system that we now know as Visa. Hock was a man who liked to think grandiose thoughts. When it came to Visa, and credit cards in general, Hock used to describe them not just as a way to get a short-term loan but as a new kind of payment system, an exchange of value that was on par with, and that competed with, cash. As it turns out -- and the bitcoin experience is helping to illustrate this -- Hock's description of credit cards was more than a little hyperbolic. Yes, you could now use a small plastic card instead of cash to buy something, but that card had value because it connected both the buyer and the seller to a fiat currency. People trusted it because they believed in their country's currency and financial institutions. The exchange of value was never the credit card itself; it was still the dollar, the pound, the yen.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, is truly a new form of payment system, unconnected to any currency or any government. Its libertarian proponents in Silicon Valley love that about it; they talk about it as a potential disrupter of traditional financial institutions. It has value not because a government has decreed and backed its value -- the classic definition of a fiat currency -- but because a community of users has decided to give it value. Its current travails, however, suggest that may also be its inherent flaw: that however much we say we mistrust governments and banks, when it comes to our money, we trust them a lot more than we trust some clever lines of computer code. The Internet, I should note, could really use a digital currency. For starters, it would make transactions on the web much easier while cutting down on the rampant credit card fraud and identity theft that exists online. It is also true that there have been many unsuccessful attempts to create a digital currency. Bitcoin is by far the most ingenious attempt, and it solves numerous problems. It allows for anonymity, just like cash, while also rendering transactions public, which ensures against double spending (that is, using the same bitcoins for multiple transactions). It is virtually impossible to counterfeit. And, as Felix Salmon pointed out last year, ''to all intents and purposes, bitcoins are invisible to law enforcement and the taxman.'' But so far bitcoins have less resembled a currency than a commodity. Up until now, they have mostly been used for pure speculation. Indeed, because there are only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation, the speculative ride has been pretty wild. In February, the bitcoin dropped in value from around $880 to the mid-$5oos.Bitcoin's gyrations hardly engender trust among potential users. And the recent bitcoin-related news isn't exactly reassuring either. First, a well-known bitcoin entrepreneur was arrested for allegedly laundering criminals' money on an underground website called Silk Road, which traffics in, among other things, illegal drugs. Then, Mt. Gox, the leading bitcoin exchange, went out of business -- and nobody knows what happened to the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins it was holding for customers. The country's most prominent bitcoin backer, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, whose firm is funding bitcoin-related start-ups, raced to CNBC to claim that the Mt. Gox failure was just part of the growing pains for bitcoins. And maybe it is. But who in his right mind, whether merchant or customer, is going to engage in commerce with a currency so seemingly unstable, or one that can so quickly disappear? The great irony of bitcoin is that its anonymous creator (or creators), who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, believed that people would want his new currency because they had learned to mistrust financial institutions. As Salmon notes, when Nakamoto introduced bitcoin, in February 2009, he wrote: '' 'The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.' '' All of which is true. But however angry we might be at bank compensation or at the role of financial institutions in the financial crisis, we still trust banks to safeguard our money, and we still trust government to back our currency. For bitcoin to succeed, it will have to embrace the one thing it was most intended to avoid: government. "
Seeking Help,"TOKYO -- Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange based here that filed for bankruptcy protection last month, said on Wednesday that it had asked the Japanese police for advice on Bitcoins worth half a billion dollars that the company claims were stolen by hackers.  It remains unclear, however, whether the Tokyo Metropolitan Police will start a formal investigation into the purported heist. Very few of the investors who were left in the lurch when Mt. Gox shut down last month are Japanese, and the government has signaled that it intends to take a hands-off approach to regulating the virtual currency. Some Mt. Gox investors, meanwhile, have claimed that there was fraud at the exchange. Mt. Gox said in a statement on its website that it had discussed the situation with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, and handed over electronic records and other materials the exchange ''thought would be necessary'' for an investigation into the missing virtual currency. An official with the Tokyo police refused to confirm that it had been contacted by Mt. Gox, or that an investigation was underway. He spoke on condition of anonymity, citing police protocol. Lawyers representing Mt. Gox could not be reached immediately for comment. Mt. Gox, led by its chief executive, Mark Karpeles, was once a pioneering platform in the world of online virtual currencies that allowed users to buy Bitcoins or sell them for cash. But the exchange filed for bankruptcy protection last month, saying it had lost 750,000 of its customers' Bitcoins, along with 100,000 of its own, likely to online hackers. Mt. Gox also said about $28 million of money in its bank accounts was unaccounted for. Mt. Gox subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States, where it faces a class-action lawsuit from investors in the exchange who claim fraud was committed. In a bizarre twist, Mt. Gox reported last week that it had found 200,000 missing Bitcoins, worth about $116 million, in an online ''wallet'' that it had previously thought was empty. That discovery underscored the difficulties of getting a clear accounting of Mt. Gox's Bitcoin holdings, and of verifying its account of its losses. An administrator appointed by the Tokyo District Court is expected to determine soon whether Mt. Gox still has the means to rehabilitate its business, or whether it should be liquidated. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"In Disarray, Mt. Gox Signals a Move Toward Liquidation","Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy protection early this year after disclosing that hackers had made off with a half-billion dollars' worth of the virtual currency, said on Wednesday that it would most likely be liquidated.  In a statement on its website, the company said a local court had dismissed its request that it be allowed to try to rehabilitate its business. A court-appointed lawyer will now oversee its assets ahead of any payout to creditors, the statement said. Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo, said that drafting a rehabilitation plan had proved ''difficult.'' When it filed for bankruptcy protection in late February, the exchange said it was unclear what had happened to its users' Bitcoins, or indeed if its accounting of its currency holdings was accurate. The company later said it had discovered about 200,000 of the virtual coins in an ''old-format'' wallet that stored the virtual currency offline. Documents leaked last week showed one plan, backed by a group of United States investors, that proposed buying the company for just one Bitcoin, or about $520. The move to liquidate Mt. Gox ''will create great inconvenience and concerns to our creditors for which we apologize,'' the statement said. Mark Karpeles, the exchange's chief executive, had ''lost his authority'' over the company's assets, it said. Mt. Gox had been a pioneer in the world of virtual currency exchanges, at one point handling about 80 percent of Bitcoin transactions. But last year, it began losing significant ground to more advanced exchanges, like BTC-e in Bulgaria and Bitstamp in Slovenia. Mt. Gox was also plagued by late payments to its users, especially after the authorities seized about $5 million of its funds in the United States in mid-2013, saying it had failed to register as a money-transmitting service. The exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo on Feb. 28, saying it had lost about 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to its customers and more than 100,000 of its own coins -- essentially its entire stock, worth almost $500 million. The company faces class-action lawsuits in the United States and Canada from users who claim fraud by the company and by its chief executive. Mr. Karpeles could not be reached for comment. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Consumer Protection Bureau Warns on Bitcoins,"Bitcoin is in the cross hairs of another federal agency. On Monday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued its first consumer advisory on virtual currencies, including Bitcoin, and said it would begin accepting complaints about such issues or companies. The agency warns consumers to be aware of hackers and schemes, volatile exchange rates and a lack of government protection.  ""Virtual currencies may have potential benefits but consumers need to be cautious and they need to be asking the right questions,"" Richard Cordray, the director of the bureau, said in a statement. ""Virtual currencies are not backed by any government or central bank, and at this point, consumers are stepping into the Wild West when they engage in the market."" In the bulletin, the agency urges virtual currency users to pay attention to potential hidden costs associated with digital money. For one, the price of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly. In about five years, the value of Bitcoin has gone from just a few dollars to over $1,000. It is now trading around $580, according to the virtual currency website CoinDesk.  ""This is positive for consumers,"" said Mercedes Tunstall, a partner in the Washington office of the law firm Ballard Spahr, who has testified before Congress on digital money. ""For virtual currencies, the average consumer doesn't really know how to protect themselves, and they really cannot protect themselves."" Experts say a lack of government regulation has contributed to this price instability, preventing digital currency from becoming more mainstream. But some Bitcoin supporters say increased regulation could thwart innovation and threaten the freedom the currency was intended to promote. The agency also warns against the false assumption that Bitcoin transactions are anonymous and urges consumers to be vigilant when transferring digital money and using virtual currency exchanges.  ""Information about each and every Bitcoin transaction is publicly shared and stored forever,"" the C.F.P.B.'s bulletin states. ""It is possible that others will be able to estimate both how much Bitcoin you own and where you are."" When it was first introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, Bitcoin largely appealed to anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology buffs who operated on the fringes of the traditional financial system. But as digital money, particularly Bitcoin, has become more popular, it has also caught the attention of government agencies, who are now grappling with how to regulate virtual currency. In March, the Internal Revenue Service announced that it would treat Bitcoin like property rather than currency for tax purposes. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have said the currency is risky but have not enacted regulations. Another issue has also been just how to enforce one country's policies across nations. One of the most spectacular failures in the currency was the shutting down of Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin trading platform that was based in Japan. Last month, New York became the first state to introduce proposed regulations for virtual currency companies. The ""BitLicense"" plan,  announced by Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State's top financial regulator, includes rules on consumer protection, the prevention of money laundering and cybersecurity. The new rules are now out for public comment.                       "
Man Is Charged With Operating a Black Market Website,"A California man has been arrested and charged with operating an online marketplace created to be a successor to the original Silk Road website, a black market for drug sales and other illegal activity that used Bitcoins.  Silk Road 2.0 was formed last November ''to fill the void'' left by the government's seizure of the original website, according to a criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The original website was ''designed to enable users anywhere in the world to buy and sell illegal drugs and other illegal goods and services anonymously and beyond the reach of law enforcement,'' the complaint said. Silk Road 2.0 was ''virtually identical to Silk Road 1.0 in its appearance and function,'' the complaint added. The defendant, Blake Benthall, 26, was arrested in San Francisco on Wednesday, and the Silk Road 2.0 website has been seized, according to the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, which announced the charges with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations. In the investigation, the complaint said, an undercover Homeland Security agent ''successfully infiltrated'' the website's support staff, was provided access to its private areas and ''regularly interacted directly'' with Mr. Benthall, who used the pseudonym Defcon. In recent months, Silk Road 2.0 had about 150,000 monthly active users, and generated at least $8 million in monthly sales and at least $400,000 in monthly commissions, the authorities said. Mr. Benthall appeared before a magistrate judge in San Francisco on Thursday and agreed to be transferred to Manhattan, said Daniel Blank, his federal public defender in San Francisco. Mr. Blank added that he expected Mr. Benthall would seek bail in New York. Mr. Benthall faces charges that include conspiracies of narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. ''Let's be clear,'' Mr. Bharara said in a statement. ''This Silk Road, in whatever form, is the road to prison. Those looking to follow in the footsteps of alleged cybercriminals should understand that we will return as many times as necessary to shut down noxious online criminal bazaars.'' As recently as Oct. 29, the complaint said, Silk Road 2.0 was ''dominated by offerings for illegal narcotics,'' with more than 14,000 listings for ''Drugs,'' including 1,654 for ''Psychedelics'' and 1,921 for ''Ecstasy.'' Recent listings, the complaint said, also included 100 grams of ''Afghan Heroin Brown Power'' for Bitcoins worth about $4,555, a fake Danish passport for Bitcoins worth about $2,414 and a fake New Jersey driver's license for Bitcoins worth about $98. Users who logged into Silk Road 2.0 were greeted with a message that said, ''Silk Road has risen from the ashes, and is now ready and waiting for you all to return home.'' In December, after the arrests of three people suspected of being administrators of the original site, Silk Road 2.0's operator, who is not identified in the complaint, ''abandoned his role'' and Mr. Benthall took over, the complaint said.

Chief of Mt. Gox Resigns From Bitcoin Foundation,"Mark Karpeles, the chief executive of Mt. Gox, once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, has resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation.  His resignation was confirmed in a brief statement on the foundation's website. It said the resignation was effective immediately.  Mt. Gox was one of three elected industry representatives on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation. The foundation said it would announce election procedures in the future. The resignation is the latest blow to Mt. Gox and Bitcoin. Mt. Gox, which is based in Tokyo, almost shut down completely earlier this month after discovering that customers could make transactions disappear from its records. While that appeared at first to be a problem limited solely to Mt. Gox, it spread to several other large exchanges, and the Bitcoin Foundation acknowledged that it was a flaw that developers had long been aware of. That disclosure served as the starting gun for a wave of hacker attacks on the main exchanges.  The problems at Mt. Gox prompted CoinDesk to remove it from its Bitcoin price index.  Mt. Gox's resignation is also the second prominent one in the last month.  Charles Shrem stepped down from the board late last month after he was arrested and charged with money laundering in connection with his Bitcoin exchange company. He pleaded not guilty. "
Bitcoin Heist Highlights Elusive Paths of Regulation,"Can nearly $450 million go missing without a crime taking place? That is only one of the questions stemming from the collapse of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox that present a host of challenges for governments worldwide that are struggling to regulate virtual currencies. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan after the disappearance of more than 744,000 Bitcoins owned by customers, along with 100,000 of its own. Unlike an ordinary robbery, this appears to be the work of hackers who exploited a weakness in the system for tracking Bitcoin transactions that allowed the currency to be diverted, perhaps over a few of years.  The number taken amounts to about 6 percent of the total Bitcoins in circulation, raising serious questions about how any virtual currency can be made safe for consumers and investors.  For law enforcement, this is like any bank robbery that requires identifying the perpetrators. DealBook reported that the Justice Department had issued subpoenas to Mt. Gox and other firms to gather information about how virtual currencies are transferred and converted into dollars. But unlike ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" none of the Mt. Gox thieves are looking back at the posse and asking ""Who are those guys?"" One of the appeals of Bitcoin is its anonymity, and trying to find those who stole something designed to be untraceable through computer hacking may well be impossible. So the losses from Mt. Gox are unlikely to be recovered.  The question becomes how governments will monitor transactions in virtual currencies to protect owners. Doing so may be even more difficult when one of the motivations for developing Bitcoin was to avoid any official involvement. Senator Joe Manchin III offered one approachin a letter sent last week to financial regulators urging them ""to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans."" This is the same strategy taken by China, which prohibited its banks from trading in virtual currencies. Unfortunately, it is easier to call for a ban on virtual currencies than actually instituting one. Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, responded to a question from Senator Manchin at a recent hearing that her agency ""simply does not have authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin in any way."" So if there is going to be a push to restrict, or even ban, the use of virtual currencies, it will have to come from Congress. The history of laws designed to impose onerous restrictions on popular goods is not positive. Prohibition failed in the 1920s, while the criminalization of marijuana and online gambling has started to crumble, so there is not much hope for blocking the use of virtual currencies. Those who lost Bitcoins held by Mt. Gox have turned to the courts, but the likelihood of securing a recovery looks small. A class-action lawsuit was filed in the Federal District Court in Chicago against the exchange claiming a number of violations of Illinois law, including consumer protection and fraud. The problem is that Mt. Gox does not appear to have any assets, so individuals are unlikely to have any legal recourse for their losses.  On the flip side, the approach taken by supporters of Bitcoin to the collapse of Mt. Gox reflects Friedrich Nietzsche's famous comment, ""That which does not kill us makes us stronger."" Barry Silbert, the chief executive of SecondMarket, plans to start a Bitcoin exchange that will be modeled after the New York Stock Exchange [link below] that can provide more reassurance to consumers. That approach may signal how governments will go about regulating virtual currencies by adapting the structure used for trading securities and commodities. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission already have in place extensive rules for how exchanges and dealers operate and, perhaps more important, record-keeping and capital requirements for those who will hold the property of others. Another possible avenue for regulation would be to fit virtual currency firms into the rules for trading regular currencies. The C.F.T.C. used authority provided by the Dodd-Frank Act to create a  regulated entity called a ""retail foreign exchange dealer,"" which is allowed to engage in retail transactions and could be expanded to cover Bitcoin trading. The record-keeping requirements for securities and commodities exchanges would be of great help to the law enforcement authorities, which rely on a paper trail to build cases involving theft, embezzlement and misappropriation. The demise of Mt. Gox shows how difficult it is to find something that exists only in cyberspace when there are inadequate records about who actually owned the property. To protect customers from a total loss, the government can also require an insurance program along the lines provided for bank and brokerage customers. Firms that hold virtual currency on behalf of customers could be required to pay into a fund to be used to reimburse at least part of the loss if another situation like the theft at Mt. Gox were to happen. Needless to say, advocates of Bitcoin who cherish its anonymity and freedom from governmental oversight will not take kindly to increased regulation, along with the costs that come with it. Losing $450 million with no realistic chance of finding the thieves will inevitably spur changes in the structure of the market for virtual currency. While Mt. Gox will not kill Bitcoin, it is pushing governments to take a more active role in overseeing how it is traded. "
Start-Up Seeks to Capitalize on Security Concerns for Bitcoins,"After living with hyperinflation, currency fluctuations and minimal access to credit in his country, Wences Casares, an Argentine raised on a sheep farm, says he has the vision and team to make Bitcoin more widespread and accepted worldwide.  Mr. Casares, a veteran tech entrepreneur who hails from the tiny Patagonian town of Esquel, is setting his sights on an equally volatile space: virtual currencies. Xapo, his new start-up that opened to the public this week, provides a Bitcoin wallet combined with a cold storage vault, allowing for transfers. The vault is a series of physical servers all over the world that has biometric access, security and is filmed around the clock, Mr. Casares said. The vault also comes with insurance, provided by the Meridian Insurance Group.  As security concerns abound for Bitcoin believers, especially after the recent collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange, Mr. Casares may have struck at the right time. An estimated 750,000 customers lost more than $450 million worth of Bitcoins when the site went dark and filed for bankruptcy last month. The idea for the company germinated in early 2011 when Mr. Casares bought his first Bitcoins, three for approximately $3 a piece, he recalled.  He kept buying more. He then looked for a way to store them and so built a so-called vault for his personal collection. Soon after, friends began asking if they could also store their supply there and he obliged.  Financial institutions made similar requests, and over the last year, Xapo stored Bitcoins for family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and hedge funds. The Argentine would not name them, citing confidentiality, but said about half were based in the United States and the rest spread  over the globe. On Thursday, Mr. Casares announced that Xapo, based in Palo Alto, Calif., received $20 million in funding in a round led by Benchmark Capital. Ribbit Capital and Fortress Investment Group also joined. Mr.  Casares also has the tech credentials to win that kind of backing from Silicon Valley after having run Lemon, a digital wallet that was acquired last year by LifeLock for about $43 million.  Matt Cohler, a partner at Benchmark Capital and a former Facebook and LinkedIn executive, said he backed the company in part because he believed it was making an important contribution to building trust in the Bitcoin ecosystem. He also noted that Mr. Casares's experiences in Argentina and Brazil, where credit access remains scarce, have immense value. ""His personal passion for Bitcoin and his depth and breadth of expertise in global fintech are unparalleled,"" Mr. Cohler said.  Wedbush Securities in a February research note estimated that nearly $86 million of venture capital has been invested in Bitcoin-related companies, mostly in the last 12 months.  Xapo's team includes Federico Murrone, co-founder and chief operating officer, and a longtime associate, and Carlos Rienzi, its senior vice president of security, who was formerly a systems engineer at Cisco Systems. Cindy McAdam is co-founder and president, and Mary Chan is controller. Ted Rogers joined Xapo this year as senior vice president of business development. He previously lived in Brazil and was a general partner at Arpex Capital, a venture capital firm. He is currently a limited partner at that firm.  Most of these people worked with Mr. Casares at his previous company, Lemon.  "
Profiles in Online Identity Cleansing,"Ben Johnson is the host of Marketplace Tech, a daily radio program and podcast. When a stranger knocked on her door three years ago, Susan Manion decided to do more to protect her private information. As a musician in Northern Illinois, she was used to people getting in touch. But her work had started to draw unwanted attention. ''It wasn't a stalker,'' says Ms. Manion. She thinks the man wanted to collaborate, but her doorstep was the wrong place. ''We didn't want something like that happening again. It creeped me out.''  Ms. Manion signed up for DeleteMe, a service from the company Abine. It promises to ''remove your public profile from leading data sites.'' Your public data profile can include photos of your house or family, your address and contact information. Ms. Manion has paid for Abine's service for two years and says her home address and phone number are less likely to pop up in search results. Nearly 25 years after the first publicly viewable website appeared, the culture of sharing on the Internet is changing. Privacy and anonymity are crucial features of new social apps like Secret, Whisper and Canary. A growing number of websites also offer services that claim to help protect, maintain or even erase what is fast becoming your most permanent and accessible record: data that can be gleaned about you from search engine results. These businesses are responding to what they see as evolving consumer interest. This month, a report by the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project found varying attitudes around privacy but a consensus around the challenges of managing personal information online. ''There's this overwhelming sense that consumers feel they've lost control over the way their data is used by companies,'' says Mary Madden, a senior researcher at Pew. That is exactly what people like Rob Shavell, Abine's chief executive, are banking on. When Mr. Shavell and his co-founders started the company in 2009, financing was not easy to find. Investors didn't think young users cared about privacy. But Mr. Shavell said that in the last six months, Abine had faced more competition than in its first four years. ''That exact group that investors told us would never care, they're moving from Facebook to Snapchat,'' Mr. Shavell said, referring to the app that allows users to send messages that disappear right after delivery. ''They do all kinds of things to make sure they're managing their online identities in such a way that it's not going to have so many negative ramifications.'' Other data companies are pivoting. MyLife.com began as Reunion.com in 2002, helping users connect with old classmates and friends. Then Facebook happened. ''As Facebook became so popular, we realized there wasn't as much of a need for our services,'' said Jeffrey Tinsley, the company's chief executive. ''So we looked for other opportunities.'' That road has had bumpy stretches. The firm was criticized for mining the email address books of some of its 52 million users for new customers. Mr. Tinsley realized the script on privacy had flipped. So he changed his business model to helping users try to manage their public data online. ''Three years ago, 75 percent of our revenue was public profile stuff and maybe 25 percent was helping people take it down,'' he said. ''Now it's the exact opposite.'' To deliver for their customers, subscription services like Abine, MyLife and Reputation.com (the latter a funder of ''Marketplace'' programming) use organized, repeated pressure. The cost: roughly $100 to $200 a year. Once a user signs up, these services go to top data broker websites like Spokeo.com, which collects information, then creates and sells profiles on consumers. They fill out removal forms on behalf of users. But the result is never a full cleanup. ''The options for getting facts and personal information removed once it's been posted online in the U.S. are fairly limited,'' says Christopher T. Bavitz, managing director of the Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard Law School. ''It's very challenging to regulate the spread of this kind of information, but it's challenging for very good reasons. The first good reason is the First Amendment.'' Users' control over information has fared better in Europe after a May ruling from the European Court of Justice on the so-called right to be forgotten. That allows users to petition search engines to remove outdated or incorrect information. Google reports receiving over 169,000 requests and approving about 41 percent. A growing chorus of voices is worried that the emergence of paid services that promise to clean up data could result in another case of the haves and have-nots. Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington, said many states sold, rented or granted access to criminal records and other information to third-party data brokers. ''If a juvenile commits a crime but doesn't reoffend, they might have the right to get the state's record sealed or expunged,'' Mr. Calo said. ''But the user doesn't have the same right to access when it comes to the data broker.'' Mr. Calo worries that these sorts of arrangements disproportionately affect populations that cannot afford to pay even once, let alone for the subscription fee that many services charge. If you ask Philip R. Zimmermann whether money can buy back privacy, he will laugh and point to a paradox. If money is no object, he said, you are too famous to escape the Internet anyway. Mr. Zimmermann created Pretty Good Privacy, or P.G.P., a widely used email encryption program, in 1991. He now runs Silent Circle, a company that promises encrypted communication and offers the $629 Blackphone, a smartphone that features a custom operating system and applications. Silent Circle tries to protect a user's privacy right at the start, instead of acting as a cleaning service. Encryption is key. When it comes to cleaning up information that is already public, however, Mr. Zimmermann recalled the plutonium contamination at the Rocky Flats Plant nuclear weapons facility in Colorado. ''It gets into the soil,'' he said. ''If you're a person that's not of any interest to anyone, then maybe your information exists only on a couple of servers. Maybe. But once it's out, it's pretty hard to get it cleaned up. You can't put toothpaste back in the tube.'' "
Hackers Find Way to Outwit Tough Security at Banking Sites,"It is not often a computer hack is named after cheese. Researchers at the computer security company Trend Micro have named a new attack on online banking Emmental. Why? Like the Swiss cheese, the researchers said, online banking protections may be ""full of holes.""  The researchers uncovered what they say is a sophisticated, multistage attack by cybercriminals determined to bypass the so-called two-factor authentication systems at banks in Austria, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, according to a report to be released Tuesday. Most sites ask for a single password. But two-factor authentication systems require customers to enter a second, one-time password that has been emailed or texted to their phones. The hope is that a second identifying factor eliminates the risk that criminals can break into customers' accounts simply by stealing an online password. But Trend Micro found that hackers were able to bypass the two-factor authentication systems at the European and Japanese banks through an attack that begins - as most do - with a phishing email. The email, which purports to be from popular retailers, includes malicious attachments disguised as receipts. By opening the attachments, victims download malicious software onto their machines. In turn, when someone tries to reach a real bank site, that software redirects the victim to a site managed by criminals. Trend Micro's researchers said victims trying to contact six banking websites in Austria, seven in Sweden, 16 in Switzerland and five in Japan were then redirected to fake sites that asked them to enter their account details, password and personal identification number. The criminals would also prod victims to download a mobile application, available in Google's Android store.  The app was posing as something that would improve security. But once downloaded, it allowed criminals to gain full access to their victims' bank accounts. It was able to intercept the second password that legitimate banks send their customers so that they can log into their bank accounts remotely. The attackers then sent that password to their own command and control server. Then, combined with the victim's stolen online banking credentials, the hackers pilfered their victims' accounts. Trend Micro said researchers had uncovered clues suggesting that Eastern European hackers are behind the Emmental attack. They found Russian slang - ""obnilium rid"" which means ""set to zero"" - buried in the rogue app code. In some cases, the criminals' logs appeared to originate from Romania. ""A Russian speaker based in Romania could be responsible for the whole operation,"" Trend Micro's researchers said. ""Or, the brains behind this operation could be based in Russia and the Romanian connection only plays a small part in the attack. We cannot say for sure."" The researchers concluded that two-factor authentication is not as secure as many businesses would expect. Trend Micro recommended that banks consider alternative methods of authentication, including adding other layers of transaction authentication numbers, a photo-based approach or a physical card reader. ""Bank clients are advised to take all necessary precautions to secure their transactions, especially since the attacks mentioned in this paper occur entirely on their side,"" Trend Micro said in the report.

"Swindlers Use Telephones, With Internet's Tactics","SEATTLE -- Phone swindles are practically as old as the telephone itself. But new technology has led to an onslaught of Internet-inspired fraud tactics that try to use telephone calls to dupe millions of people or to overwhelm switchboards for essential public services, causing deep concern among law enforcement and other groups. People, businesses and government agencies across the country are combating the new schemes, in which scammers use the Internet to send huge volumes of calls at the same time. Many of the attacks bombard individuals with automated requests for personal data, in a variation of their email-scam cousins. But others are more vicious, flooding entire phone systems when demands are not met, similar to some attacks against websites. ''You can blast out 100 million calls from the comfort of your keyboard,'' said Kati Daffan, a lawyer in the bureau of consumer protection at the Federal Trade Commission.  In October, the Department of Homeland Security advised federal agencies, local governments and other organizations to be prepared for so-called denial of service attacks, which flood phone systems with calls, making them unusable by legitimate callers. The warning came after attacks against a sheriff's office in the Southern United States and another against a Coast Guard cutter. The department said there had been over 200 such attacks identified against public sector groups. As they are for most forms of Internet fraud, the latest phone schemes are also difficult to track and investigate because of their frequency, their layers of anonymity and their global nature. Several investigators could not name a successful prosecution of the latest wave of phone swindles, though cybercriminals who committed other forms of fraud have been arrested. In Tarrant County, Tex., the phone lines of several emergency dispatch centers were disabled in the last year because of a surge of automated calls, said Wanda S. McCarley, director of operations for the Tarrant County 911 District, which includes Fort Worth. The attacks lasted up to an hour and were aimed at 10-digit phone emergency numbers at the centers, which are accessible to callers outside the area, rather than 911 lines, which are not. Something similar happened to a Texas hospital two years ago, when an intensive care unit's phone lines were disabled for about six hours, said the chief information officer for the hospital chain that owns the facility, who spoke on the condition that he not be named to avoid unwanted attention for his employer. To defend itself, the hospital started using a service from SecureLogix, a telephone-security company, which the hospital's chief information officer said had been effective. In both cases, employees at the facilities were contacted by callers who said they were debt collectors seeking repayment of loans taken out by the workers. If the employees did not pay up, the callers threatened, the lines at the employees' workplaces would be brought down. The attackers then overwhelmed the lines with repeated calls, causing busy signals for legitimate callers. It is not clear how or why the specific employees were chosen, though law enforcement officials believe that swindlers in such cases may find names on public staff directories or professional sites like LinkedIn. Some pay up in such swindles, often out of uncertainty about whether they owe the money or to avoid embarrassment at their workplaces, law enforcement officials said. Ralph A. Gagliardi, agent in charge with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's identity theft and mortgage fraud units, said he traced payments from the victim in one such attack in Colorado to Nigeria via an intermediary in Florida. Michael J. McKeown, supervisory special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Pittsburgh, said, ''If people do pay, that makes their problems stop, but it may make it more lucrative for people to do this.'' For years, government officials have warned the public of email frauds that request personal information, known as phishing. Over time, the public education has made it harder to trick people over email. But there has been less public outreach about similar new types of phone schemes, sometimes called vishing. These more traditional swindles, which ask individual recipients to provide personal or financial information, appear to be up sharply as well. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission said, telephone calls accounted for 34 percent of the fraud complaints it received from people who reported how they had been contacted, up from 20 percent in 2010. Phone fraud was second only to email, which accounted for 38 percent of complaints in 2012. Automatic dialing software and Internet phone services make it easy to place huge volumes of calls from anywhere in the world. Often, swindlers create messages in a synthesized voice and say they are from a financial institution. The call prompts the recipients to enter personal data through their phone keypads. Because making phone calls over the Internet is so inexpensive, the practice can be lucrative even if only a tiny percentage of the people provide information. Personal financial data obtained this way can be easily sold on the black market. Financial and government officials say it is unclear how much money is lost to such schemes. Jimmy Forester of Portland, Ore., is one person who didn't fall for a phone swindle. A message he received a few weeks ago told him his credit card needed to be reactivated and asked him to enter his account information. Instead, he punched in random numbers because he was curious to see the fraudulent call through to its end. ''Fake emails are usually pretty easy to spot because you can look and see if it came from Bank of America or from FreeEmailAddressInEgypt.com,'' said Mr. Forester, 29, who is an electrician. ''With the phone, you don't have that option of researching.'' Banks have begun warning their customers to avoid providing any personal data through their phones when they receive such a call. Officials worry that the new threats are particularly effective against older Americans, who use phones more than computers and who seem to be more trusting. ''Some of these people are so darned convincing,'' said Debbie Matz, chairwoman of the National Credit Union Administration, the agency that regulates federal credit unions. Mr. Gagliardi began receiving complaints in Colorado last fall in a case that illustrates how phone frauds can ripple across the country. Residents were receiving calls saying that their cellphone or bank accounts were compromised, and that they needed to provide credit card information. The deceptions did not end there. The swindler used software to make the calls look as if they were originating from a law firm in Palo Alto, Calif. Many people called the firm to complain, and they were directed to call the local police department instead. The police department, as a result, was swamped with more than 2,000 phone calls over several days, causing busy signals for other callers. ''People have gotten trained now that you don't just click on random stuff in email,'' said Henning Schulzrinne, the chief technologist with the Federal Communications Commission. ''People don't necessarily understand how nontrustworthy caller ID has become.'' "
Shootings by Police Protested in Albuquerque,"ALBUQUERQUE -- Hundreds of demonstrators marched in downtown Albuquerque on Sunday to protest deadly shootings by the police, including that of a homeless man who was killed after a standoff with officers.  The Albuquerque Police Department also confirmed that its website was affected by a hacking attack. In a YouTube video, a group purporting to be the computer hacking collective Anonymous had called for the protest march and had threatened to disrupt local government websites. A police spokesman, Simon Drobik, said in a statement that the department's site was struck just before 11 a.m.; it was back up late Sunday afternoon. The origin of the hacking was not immediately clear, Mr. Drobik said. ''We can confirm that the website disruption is due to a cyberattack,'' Mr. Drobik said. He added that the department's website was not connected to any critical services. The YouTube video, which was posted last week, said that government sites in Albuquerque would be hacked in retaliation for a recent shooting by the police in the Sandia foothills that left a homeless man dead. The March 16 shooting, which was captured on video, has prompted a federal investigation, along with public protests and calls for police reforms. Albuquerque officials said the city also experienced a ''temporary, brief disruption'' to the municipal website late Saturday. A spokeswoman, Erin Thompson, said that officials had not determined the cause of that problem, but that a team was monitoring the city's websites. Authorities have called Anonymous a loosely organized worldwide group that has accessed confidential data and disrupted websites. The hundreds of demonstrators who gathered at Albuquerque Civic Plaza on Sunday carried signs protesting recent shootings. Since 2010, Albuquerque officers have been involved in 37 shootings, 23 of them fatal. Last week, Albuquerque police officers shot and killed a man at a public housing complex after the authorities said he opened fire on officers. In the recent foothills shooting, the authorities said James Boyd, 38, died after officers fired stun guns, bean bags and six live rounds. The police said Mr. Boyd had threatened to kill officers and held knives as an unarmed K-9 officer approached him. The shooting followed a long standoff during which Mr. Boyd claimed he was a federal agent. A helmet-camera video showed Mr. Boyd agreeing to walk down the mountain with the officers, gathering his belongings and taking a step toward officers just before they fired. The F.B.I. has opened an investigation into the shooting. The Justice Department began investigating the Albuquerque Police Department more than a year ago in connection with possible civil rights violations and use of excessive force. "
Pro-Democracy Media Company's Websites Attacked,"Next Media, which publishes Apple Daily, an independent Hong Kong newspaper often critical of the Chinese government, saw the largest attack ever against the company's websites on Wednesday, taking the group's websites offline for hours. ""The scale is so big that it overwhelmed the DDoS protection service provider we hired to prevent an outage like this,"" said Tim Yiu, Next Media's chief operating officer. In a DDoS, or distributed denial-of-service, attack, hackers command swarms of computers to generate an enormous flood of traffic to knock out the target websites. Mr. Yiu said he received the first reports of the attack at about 2 a.m., and access to Apple Daily's Hong Kong website was brought to a near halt for about 12 hours. He expected full web services to resume by Thursday afternoon. Other sites in the media group, including Apple Daily Taiwan, were affected for varying durations.  Next Media's founder, Jimmy Lai, said in an interview that ""it's not my business to speculate"" who exactly was behind the attack. But he added: ""Whoever is behind it, it's obvious that he wants to muzzle the voice for the referendum. This kind of scale of attack is currently out of our technical power to stop. We're searching for better defense."" Like his flagship newspaper, Apple Daily, Mr. Lai has been a staunch supporter of the Occupy Central campaign, which has been pushing for changes in how Hong Kong's next leader will be chosen. Since Sunday, Mr. Lai has participated in a daily 10-kilometer walk across Hong Kong to promote an unofficial referendum Occupy Central is holding from this Friday to June 29 to rally support for the public's right to nominate candidates for the election of Hong Kong's next chief executive, a method Beijing opposes. Apple Daily issued a statement on its Taiwan website condemning the attack, saying that ""we have reason to strongly suspect the attack was carried out by hackers from China, trying to suppress Hong Kong people's determination to fight for democracy and to attack the pro-universal suffrage Next Media group."" The attack on Next Media coincided with a similar denial-of-service attack on Occupy Central's online voting platform, raising suspicions that opponents of Occupy Central are trying to thwart its campaign. ""The Apple Daily has been very vocal in encouraging people to vote on the referendum,"" said Chan Yuen-man, a journalism lecturer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""I would imagine whoever it is behind the attack, they are trying to target the referendum. It's hard to say it's not an attack on the freedom of the press."" Since the former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, its top officials have been selected by a small group of delegates loyal to Beijing. The current chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, has been called ""689"" by his critics because, in the city of more than 7 million people, he won office with just 689 votes from a committee of 1,200 members. Ms. Chan said that many local news outlets are controlled by owners with close business ties to China, many of them members of China's national legislature and its advisory body. ""Apple Daily is almost a lone voice now, a media that's quite blatantly pro-democracy in Hong Kong and critical of the regime in Beijing and the Hong Kong government,"" she said. ""At this moment in time, Hong Kong needs Apple Daily."" Charles Mok, a Hong Kong legislator representing the information and technology sector, said that such attacks are becoming a common weapon in Hong Kong politics. He noted that the newspaper and the voting platform, run by the Public Opinion Program at the University of Hong Kong, had been victims of multiple denial-of-service attacks in the past. Recently, he said, the website of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements, which runs a museum focusing on the 1989 military suppression of the Tiananmen Square protest movement, was blocked a few days before the June 4 anniversary of the crackdown. ""The more important thing right now is that I believe the government needs to pay serious attention to it and not take a political side on it,"" Mr. Mok said, adding that the Hong Kong government should try to help mitigate such attacks, and work with international partners to go after the attackers. Recently, a Next Media executive said two major British banks had stopped advertising with Apple Daily at the behest of the Chinese government. Next Media filed a report on the incident with the Hong Kong police, which listed the case under ""criminal damage,"" and placed it under investigation by the Commercial Crime Bureau.

Security Firm Described Simulation as Real Hack,"BAE Systems Applied Intelligence, a defense, aerospace and security company, recently noted in a report that one of its clients at an unnamed hedge fund lost millions of dollars because of  a cyberattack. But the incident was, in fact, a simulation run by the security firm itself.  In a June 19 television interview, Paul Henninger, the global product manager for BAE Systems Applied Intelligence told CNBC that his firm had identified and thwarted a cyber attack on a hedge fund in 2013 that took months for the firm to notice and had eventually cost the fund millions of dollars. ""This particular attack happened at the end of 2013,"" Mr. Henninger said in his CNBC interview. ""It took a couple of months before the firm itself realized that something was wrong. And then it took about a few weeks for the investigation to get to the point where we made the connection between the network anomalies and the trading anomalies. So the actual resolution of the attack was fairly rapid."" Mr. Henninger spoke specifically about the details of the breach and its aftermath. ""This was not something that was a minor issue for them, this was something that was getting reviewed at the board level at this hedge fund precisely because it was having a material impact on the performance across the portfolio."" Mr. Henninger never named the fund in question, but that day BAE's stock traded up 1.6 percent that day, with higher-than-average trading volume. Three weeks later, BAE Systems admitted its report was unfounded. The attack was not an attack after all, but a simulation. ""Although the example was a plausible scenario, we believe that it does not relate to a specific company client,"" BAE Systems said in an emailed statement. ""We sincerely apologize for this inaccuracy. We are taking the necessary action to ensure this type of error does not occur again."" Articulate Communications, BAE Systems' public relations firm that pitched the original interview deferred questions to BAE Systems. Jena Murphy, BAE Systems' spokeswoman in the United States also deferred questions to her manager in the United Kingdom, who did not return requests for additional comment on Monday. Mr. Henninger, the global product manager who was interviewed by CNBC, could not be reached for comment. The New York Times Bits blog wrote about a recent trend of cyber criminals zeroing in on hedge funds and brokerage firms, which security experts say has been happening for the last two years, and cited the CNBC report, but could not verify its accuracy. BAE Systems is a defense contractor based in the United Kingdom, with operations in the United States, Saudi Arabia and Australia. This year, the company has been aggressively marketing its cyber intelligence services. In March, the company pitched a report about a cyber weapon, dubbed Snake, that had apparently been used by Russia against targets in the Ukraine. "
Chinese Hackers Pursue Key Data on U.S. Workers,"WASHINGTON -- Chinese hackers in March broke into the computer networks of the United States government agency that houses the personal information of all federal employees, according to senior American officials. They appeared to be targeting the files on tens of thousands of employees who have applied for top-secret security clearances. The hackers gained access to some of the databases of the Office of Personnel Management before the federal authorities detected the threat and blocked them from the network, according to the officials. It is not yet clear how far the hackers penetrated the agency's systems, in which applicants for security clearances list their foreign contacts, previous jobs and personal information like past drug use.  In response to questions about the matter, a senior Department of Homeland Security official confirmed that the attack had occurred but said that ''at this time,'' neither the personnel agency nor Homeland Security had ''identified any loss of personally identifiable information.'' The official said an emergency response team was assigned ''to assess and mitigate any risks identified.'' One senior American official said that the attack was traced to China, though it was not clear if the hackers were part of the government. Its disclosure comes as a delegation of senior American officials, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, are in Beijing for the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the leading forum for discussion between the United States and China on their commercial relationships and their wary efforts to work together on economic and defense issues. Computer intrusions have been a major source of discussion and disagreement between the two countries, and the Chinese can point to evidence, revealed by Edward J. Snowden, that the National Security Agency went deep into the computer systems of Huawei, a major maker of computer network equipment, and ran many programs to intercept the conversations of Chinese leaders and the military. American officials say the attack on the Office of Personnel Management was notable because while hackers try to breach United States government servers nearly every day, they rarely succeed. One of the last attacks the government acknowledged occurred last year at the Department of Energy. In that case, hackers successfully made off with employee and contractors' personal data. The agency was forced to reveal the attack because state disclosure laws force entities to report breaches in cases where personally identifiable information is compromised. Government agencies do not have to disclose breaches in which sensitive government secrets, but no personally identifiable information, has been stolen. Just a month ago, the Justice Department indicted a group of Chinese hackers who work for the People's Liberation Army Unit 61398, and charged them with stealing corporate secrets. The same unit, and others linked to the P.L.A., have been accused in the past of intrusions into United States government computer systems, including in the office of the secretary of defense. But private security researchers say the indictments have hardly deterred the People's Liberation Army from hacking foreign targets, and American officials are increasingly concerned that they have failed in their effort to deter computer attacks from China or elsewhere. ''There's no price to pay for the Chinese,'' one senior intelligence official said recently, ''and nothing will change until that changes.'' The indictments have been criticized as long on symbolism and short on real punishment: There is very little chance that the Chinese military members would ever see the inside of an American courtroom, even if the F.B.I. has put their pictures on wanted posters. ''I think that it was speaking loudly and carrying a small stick,'' said Dennis Blair, the former director of national intelligence during President Obama's first term, who was a co-author of a report last year urging that the United States create a series of financial disincentives for computer theft and attacks, including halting some forms of imports and blocking access to American financial markets. Not long after several members of Unit 61398 were indicted, security researchers were able to pin hundreds more cyberattacks at American and European space and satellite technology companies and research groups on a second Shanghai-based Chinese military unit, known as Unit 61486. Researchers say that even after Americans indicted their counterparts in Unit 61398, members of Unit 61486 have shown no signs of scaling back. The same proved true for the dozen other Chinese military and naval units that American officials have been tracking as they break into an ever more concerning list of corporate targets including drone, missile and nuclear propulsion technology makers. The intrusion at the Office of Personnel Management was particularly disturbing because it oversees a system called e-QIP, in which federal employees applying for security clearances enter their most personal information, including financial data. Federal employees who have had security clearances for some time are often required to update their personal information through the website. The agencies and the contractors use the information from e-QIP to investigate the employees and ultimately determine whether they should be granted security clearances, or have them updated. A representative of the Office of Personnel Management said that monitoring systems at the Department of Homeland Security and the agency office allowed them to be ''alerted to a potential intrusion of our network in mid-March.'' In the past, the Obama administration has urged American companies to share intrusion information with the government and reveal breaches to consumers in cases where their personal information was compromised and could be used without authorization. But in this case there was no announcement about the attack. ''The administration has never advocated that all intrusions be made public,'' said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the Obama administration. ''We have advocated that businesses that have suffered an intrusion notify customers if the intruder had access to consumers' personal information. We have also advocated that companies and agencies voluntarily share information about intrusions.'' Ms. Hayden noted that the agency had intrusion-detection systems in place and notified other federal agencies, state and local governments about the attack, then shared relevant threat information with some in the security industry. Four months after the attack, Ms. Hayden said the Obama administration had no reason to believe personally identifiable information for employees was compromised. ''None of this differs from our normal response to similar threats,'' Ms. Hayden said. "
Anonymity in Police Shooting Fuels Frustration,"FERGUSON, Mo. -- In the five days since an unarmed young black man was fatally shot by a police officer here, the selective release of information about the shooting, and especially the anonymity granted to the officer, has stoked frustrations in this largely African-American community north of St. Louis, where residents describe increasingly tense relations with the police. The police chief, Thomas Jackson, has repeatedly declined to identify the officer, who has been put on administrative leave. But on Wednesday, the chief did offer a new detail about the shooting, which has kindled nights of racial unrest and an unyielding police response with tear gas, rubber bullets and arrests. Chief Jackson said that the officer who shot Michael Brown, 18, on Saturday was struck in the face during the encounter and treated at a hospital. Touching his own cheek, the chief said that a side of the officer's face was swollen from what the police have described as a struggle in which Mr. Brown assaulted the officer and tried to take his gun -- an account disputed by a witness, a friend of Mr. Brown's who said his hands were raised when the last of several shots was fired.  Despite persistent and increasingly angry calls from the public to release the officer's name, Chief Jackson said the officer required protection after numerous death threats had been made. Computer hackers, saying they were outraged by police conduct, now have also joined the fray. Anonymous, the loosely organized group of international hackers, said on Twitter that it had broken into Ferguson's municipal computer system. It released details about city workers and posted photos of Jon Belmar, the chief of the St. Louis County police who is conducting the investigation into the shooting, as well as his wife, son and daughter. It also posted his address and phone number. The group threatened to bring down city, county and federal networks if the police overreacted to rallies and protests. On Wednesday night, scores of police officers in riot gear and in armored trucks showed up to disperse protesters who had gathered on the streets near the scene of the shooting. Some officers perched atop the vehicles with their guns trained on the crowds while protesters chanted, ''Hands up, don't shoot.'' A police spokesman said that some demonstrators had thrown Molotov cocktails at officers and that some had tried to set fires. The police used tear gas on demonstrators, and some protesters said rubber bullets had been fired at them. Police said one officer appeared to have suffered a broken ankle after being hit by a brick. The police made more than 10 arrests. Among those arrested was Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman, who had been documenting the protests on social media, his wife said on Twitter. Two reporters covering the protests also said they had been arrested inside a McDonald's for trespassing and later released without charges or an explanation. The reporters, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of The Huffington Post, both said they had been handled roughly by the police. Chief Jackson and the St. Louis County prosecutor, Robert P. McCulloch, held news conferences on Wednesday to try to allay concerns without divulging the officer's name or details of the investigation. Neither would say how many times Mr. Brown had been shot. Mr. McCulloch promised a thorough investigation but refused to say how long it would take. ''There is no timeline,'' he said. But he added that all the evidence would be made public, whether or not there was an indictment. Whether to identify an officer in a charged situation like a shooting has been a continual tug of war around the country, pitting the desire of police departments to protect their own against the demands of victims' relatives and the public for accountability. ''I get why they want to protect him,'' said Meko Taylor, 36, of Ferguson, who was at a protest on Wednesday. ''But the people want answers. When we get answers, things will calm down.'' David A. Harris, an expert on police misconduct and accountability at the University of Pittsburgh Law School, said: ''Police departments do not welcome disclosure or the input of outsiders. So when you have a problem like this, it's hardly surprising to see that they are very reluctant to give out information.'' That reflexive, insular stance is increasingly being questioned in the courts, said Merrick J. Bobb, a Los Angeles-based consultant on police oversight. ''What is happening is that in a number of jurisdictions, voluntarily or as a result of a lawsuit, the ability of police to keep the name of the officer secret has been constrained,'' he said. In Missouri, legal groups citing the state's sunshine law, which requires government agencies to release most documents to the public, have joined with community leaders to press for information about the officer who shot Mr. Brown. On Tuesday, the Missouri office of the American Civil Liberties Union wrote to the Ferguson and St. Louis County Police Departments requesting unredacted copies of the ''incident reports'' describing the death of Mr. Brown. The A.C.L.U. said it had been told by the St. Louis County police that it would not release an incident report because the investigation was continuing. Adding to the pressure, the National Bar Association, an organization of African-American lawyers and judges, also filed a records request on Wednesday with the Ferguson Police Department. By law, police departments have three days to comply, but if they choose to withhold an officer's name, they could argue that circumstances warrant an exception. Then the petitioning groups would have to file lawsuits. There is no federal constitutional right, under the First Amendment, to information about government activities, including internal police reports, said Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. Rather, individual states have disclosure laws with varying degrees of bite, and the country's thousands of law enforcement agencies have their own rules and subcultures regarding disclosures. The inconsistency in policies, even when a freedom of information law is on the books, is illustrated in New York City. In most cases, the New York Police Department refuses to release the names of officers who have shot people, at least in the days immediately afterward. If a shooting attracts widespread attention, however, the officer's name rarely remains a secret for long. In the July 17 case of Eric Garner, who died after being wrestled down by the police, including one officer who apparently used a forbidden chokehold, the department did reveal the name of the officer -- but after two days, and only after wide public viewing of a videotape of the fatal confrontation. By that time, the news media had already reported the officer's name based on unnamed sources. Mr. Harris said that while it was understandable that police officials would try to protect their officers from threats and unfair accusations, silence also had its risks. ''This case is not being tried yet, but the narrative is being forged in the public arena,'' he said of the Ferguson shooting. ''When that goes on, information is put out selectively and withheld selectively.'' ''There is real danger in that,'' he said, ''because ultimately law enforcement depends on the trust of the people they serve.'' On Wednesday, the St. Louis County medical examiner's office said it would take two to three weeks to complete the autopsy of Mr. Brown, including a toxicology report, which is standard procedure in such deaths. Suzanne McCune, a forensic administrator at the office, said that a preliminary autopsy was completed Monday and found that Mr. Brown had died of gunshot wounds, but she gave no other details. She added that Mr. Brown's body had been released to his family. Ms. McCune said the police department would decide whether to approve the release of the report once it was complete. Benjamin L. Crump, a lawyer representing the Brown family, said that arrangements were being made for a private autopsy to be performed in the next week or so. ''The family wants an autopsy done by somebody who is objective and who does not have a relationship with the Ferguson police,'' Mr. Crump said. Trying to control protests that have sprouted up daily in Ferguson and intensified after dark, the mayor and the City Council posted a letter on Wednesday on the city website asking protesters to limit their demonstrations to daylight hours. The police have made over 50 arrests since Sunday. ''We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner,'' the letter said. ''Unfortunately, those who wish to co-opt peaceful protests and turn them into violent demonstrations have been able to do so over the past several days during the evening hours.'' Chief Jackson said the request did not amount to a curfew. As to the actions of Anonymous in releasing the names of department personnel, Chief Jackson said protection had been assigned to some and others had taken vacation. Anonymous also released on Wednesday what it said were county 911 tapes from the time of the shooting on Saturday. Most initial calls seemed to be about crowd control, but the tapes also suggested that dispatchers learned from an early call that a police officer was involved. Chief Jackson said he had not heard the tapes. "
Vigils Planned Nationwide Over Ferguson Shooting,"After days of unrest in Ferguson, Mo. after the fatal shooting of an 18-year-old unarmed man, Michael Brown, organizers are planning vigils in more than 90 cities around the country to commemorate victims of police brutality.  The events were organized on Twitter by a loose network of Twitter users and social media activists under the hashtag #NMOS14, which stands for National Moment of Silence. Organizers have also used Facebook to invite and register participants for the vigils in each city. A Facebook page for the vigil in Civic Center Park in Denver, for example, listed about 200 people out of 1,400 invited indicated that they planned to attend. The vigil at Malcolm X Park in Washington had 1,400 registrants out of the 7,800 who were invited. Washington and Chicago are so far, expected to have the largest turnouts, organizers said. In a document listing the Facebook pages for the cities hosting vigils, organizers asked participants to tie a red cloth around their arms, except ''in areas where doing so can cause conflict.'' The vigils will begin at 7 p.m. Eastern time and a moment of silence is planned at 7:20 p.m. Kelly Hayes, who is helping to coordinate the Chicago vigil, which will be at the Richard J. Daley Center, said the event was expected to be peaceful and would include participants holding signs with the names and details of victims of ''folks from Chicago and all around the country who have fallen to police violence.'' Ms. Hayes said the Chicago vigil would also include poetry readings and music by members of a nonprofit organization called the Black Youth Project. ''We want to make sure that the voices heard are coming out of the most heavily impacted communities,'' she said. The vigils coincide with another set of rallies said to be organized by the hacktivist collective Anonymous that will be held in many of the same locations as the National Moment of Silence, a move that has been criticized by some of the vigil organizers. ''To have Anonymous come along and say let's turn this peaceful moment into a day of rage is highly problematic,'' said a Twitter user and primary organizer of the vigils named Michelle who tweets under the moniker @FeministaJones, and declined to give her last name because she says she has received threats. ''The last thing we need is for police around America showing up because they anticipate Anonymous hackers showing up with their Guy Fawkes masks,'' she said. Ms. Hayes in Chicago said she did not have immediate concerns about the police clashing with attendees at the vigil but ''we will have lawyers and police liaisons on the ground just in case communication with the police is necessary.'' "
An Anonymous Social App Tries to Clean Up Its Act,"What would you say if no one knew you were the one saying it? In the case of Secret, the anonymous social app many in Silicon Valley love to hate, a lot of that chatter hasn't been so kind.   People using Secret can post messages and photos from their smartphones to their networks of loosely connected friends, all through a veil of anonymity. And since January, when the app was released, some users have posted vitriolic, personal attacks against specific people - an activity that seems to happen more often when you can say anything without fear of retaliation.  On Friday Secret announced plans to invest heavily in making the network a more pleasant place to visit. The company said it would actively block a post if the company detected that someone's real name had been used in the post. Secret said it had also improved its ability to detect negative sentiment and keywords, as well as photos of specific people, which can be reviewed to make sure the posts do not violate the company's community guidelines.  Technology entrepreneurs like Dave Morin, chief executive of Path, and Ben Parr, a former blogger for the media start-up Mashable, were constant targets of personal attacks from anonymous naysayers when Secret was first introduced. Later, as Secret became more popular, misogynistic and racist remarks appeared with more frequency on the app. Pictures containing nudity have occasionally appeared as well. For David Byttow and Chrys Bader, Secret's co-founders, the goal of the app isn't to create an anonymous shooting gallery. Ultimately, the two would like the app to be a place people visit because of its flourishing, connected mobile community, one free from the strictures of identity.  ""We've learned several invaluable lessons about the great use cases of our platform, as well as the realities of unwanted behavior that can hurt our community,"" the company said in a blog post on Friday. ""We believe these improvements will move us along in our journey to help the world safely express what we're really thinking and feeling."" Anonymous communication has quickly become a hot trend in Silicon Valley. Besides Secret, apps like Whisper and Wut riff on anonymous communication methods. Websiteslike Reddit and Twitter give you the option to use a handle instead of your real name. And even Facebook, the huge social identity network, is toying with ways to incorporate anonymity into its products.  Of course, Secret's viability as an anonymous communication tool could quickly evaporate if it can't protect anonymity. On Friday, Wired published an article detailing how two security experts unmasked the identities of some users on Secret. ""User data has never been compromised in any hacker exploit, including the hack that Wired reported on today,"" the company said in a statement. The hole in Secret's system was reported to the company as part of its ""bug bounty program,"" a practice Facebook, Twitter and other tech companies have, in which hackers who find exploits in code can report them to the company for a reward.  But the changes announced on Friday raise another question, too: Can Secret keep users returning to the app if the company places more restrictions on the types of content people are allowed to post?  Perhaps Mr. Byttow and Mr. Bader should ask Twitter, which is facing its own similar problem at the moment.                        "
5 U.S. Banks Hit in Attack by Hackers,"A number of United States banks, including JPMorgan Chase and at least four others, were struck by hackers in a series of coordinated attacks this month, according to four people briefed on a continuing investigation into the crimes. The hackers infiltrated the networks of the banks, siphoning off gigabytes of data, including checking and savings account information, in what security experts described as a sophisticated cyberattack. The motivation and origin of the attacks are not yet clear, according to investigators. The F.B.I. is involved in the investigation, and in the past few weeks a number of security firms have been brought in to conduct forensic studies of the penetrated computer networks.  According to two other people briefed on the matter, hackers infiltrated the computer networks of some banks and stole checking and savings account information from clients. It was not clear whether the attacks were financially motivated, or if they were collecting intelligence as part of an espionage effort. JPMorgan has not seen any increased fraud levels, one person familiar with the situation said. ''Companies of our size unfortunately experience cyberattacks nearly every day,'' said Patricia Wexler, a JPMorgan spokeswoman. ''We have multiple layers of defense to counteract any threats and constantly monitor fraud levels.'' Joshua Campbell, an F.B.I. spokesman, said the agency was working with the Secret Service to assess the full scope of attacks. ''Combating cyberthreats and criminals remains a top priority for the United States government,'' he said. The intrusions were first reported by Bloomberg, which indicated that they were the work of Russian hackers. But security experts and government officials said they had not yet made that conclusion. Earlier this year, iSight Partners, a security firm in Dallas that provides intelligence on online threats, warned companies that they should be prepared for cyberattacks from Russia in retaliation for Western economic sanctions. But Adam Meyers, the head of threat intelligence at CrowdStrike, a security firm that works with banks, said that it would be ''premature'' to suggest the attacks were motivated by sanctions. Russian hackers began a monthlong online assault on Estonia in 2007 that nearly crippled the Baltic nation, after Estonian government workers moved a Soviet-era war memorial from the Estonian capital. Still, security experts say that the stealthy nature of the recent attacks suggests that their motivation was not political. The American banking sector has been a frequent target for hackers in recent years, with the vast majority of attacks motivated by financial theft. But not all of them. Over the past two years, banks have been targeted in a series of politically motivated attacks from Iran, in which a group of Iranian hackers flooded United States banking sites with so much online traffic -- a method called a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack -- that the websites slowed or intermittently collapsed. Hackers who took credit for those attacks said they went after the banks in retaliation for an anti-Islam video that mocked the Prophet Muhammad, and pledged to continue the attacks until the video was removed from the Internet. American intelligence officials said the group was actually a cover for the Iranian government. Officials claimed Iran was waging the attacks in retaliation for Western economic sanctions and for attacks on its own systems. Unlike the attacks traced to Iran, the recent hacks against the American banks were not intended to disrupt the bank's services but appeared to be part of a financial or intelligence-gathering effort, three people briefed on the investigations said. Mr. Meyers, of CrowdStrike, said hackers could have been after account information, or even intelligence about a potential merger or acquisition. Security experts said the hackers chose to pursue account information, not disruption, which is the earmark of state-sponsored attacks. Because JPMorgan had not seen any unusual incidences of fraud, however, it was too early to conclude that the attacks were solely financially motivated. So why were the banks targeted? Security experts said they could not yet determine whether the attacks over the past few weeks were the work of Russians, or whether they were politically motivated. Indeed, Mr. Meyers said, any such conclusions at this point would be the result of what he said was an effort by security firms to be the first to present conclusive evidence. Banks are also frequent targets for intelligence agencies looking to collect information about their targets. In 2012, Russian security researchers uncovered a computer virus on 2,500 computers, many of them inside major Lebanese banks, including the Bank of Beirut and Blom Bank. The virus was specifically intended to steal customers' login credentials to their bank accounts. The researchers believed the computer virus was state-sponsored and said they had found evidence it had been created by the same programmers who created Flame and Stuxnet, two computer viruses that officials have said were unleashed by the United States and Israel to spy on computers inside Iran. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Companies Rush to Fix Shellshock Software Bug as Hackers Launch Thousands of Attacks,"A day after the Department of Homeland Security advised Internet users and corporations about a newly discovered software bug that could affect hundreds of millions of systems, hackers had already begun exploiting the bug and companies were rushing to fix the issue for their users.   The bug, called Shellshock, affects a widely used piece of software, called Bash, which is a sort of interpreter software that is used in an array of software, including Mac's OS X operating system. The bug could be used by hackers to take control of a machine or run programs surreptitiously in the background. In a statement, Apple said that most of its OS X users were not at risk from the Shellshock bug because Apple's default settings protect users from remote exploits, like the kind cybercriminals would need to use to infiltrate a personal desktop or laptop computer. The company noted, however, that if users had reconfigured their advanced Unix services (underlying code in OS X) they might face issues. ""We are working to quickly provide a software update for our advanced Unix users,"" the company said in its statement. Early Friday afternoon, the patch was not yet available.  Initially, security experts also expressed alarm that all smartphones on Google's Android operating system would be affected. Google said on Friday, however, that Android used an alternative to Bash, called Mksh, which did not contain the vulnerability. But security experts noted that because Android is an open-source software, many corporations and users tweak it and incorporate it into other products, which could use Bash. The message is that Android users should still check to see if they are vulnerable. Trend Micro, the security firm, said it was moving quickly to release license-free tools to scan and protect vulnerable servers, as well as web users, across Mac OS X and Linux platforms. An official alert from the National Institute of Standards and Technology warned that the vulnerability was a 10 out of 10, in terms of its severity, impact and ability to be exploited, but low in terms of its complexity, meaning that it could be easily used by hackers. Security researchers say that as soon as the bug was reported they detected widespread Internet scanning by so-called white hat hackers - most likely security researchers - as well as people thought to be cybercriminals. The worry is that it is only a matter of time before somebody writes a program that will use Shellshock to take over machines. On Friday, researchers at Incapsula, the security firm, said that just in the previous 24-hour period, they had witnessed 17,400 attacks, at an average rate of 725 attacks per hour. The researchers said that more than 1,800 web domains had been attacked and that the attacks originated from 400 unique I.P. addresses- more than 55 percent of those in China and the United States.  The Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team, US-CERT, advised users and technology administrators to refer to their Linux or Unix-based operating systems suppliers for an appropriate patch.  For users at home, security experts advised them to stay on top of software updates and check manufacturer websites, particularly for hardware like routers. "
Cyberattack at JPMorgan Chase Also Hit Website of Bank's Corporate Race,"The JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge, a series of charitable races held each year in big cities across the world, is one of those feel-good events that bring together professionals from scores of big companies. It was also a target for the same cyberthieves who successfully breached the bank's digital perimeters, compromising the accounts of 76 million households and seven million small businesses, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge website, which is managed by an outside vendor, has been conspicuously inaccessible since early August, with visitors to the site seeing only a lonely list of coming races. The link between the breach on that website and the broader attack, which the bank said did not compromise any financial information, has not been previously reported. The bank said it discovered the breach in the Corporate Challenge website on Aug. 7, about a week after it learned of the broader intrusion into its computer network. By infiltrating the race website, hackers were able to gain access to passwords and contact information for participants, the bank informed them.  The website - maintained and run by an outside firm and connected to the Internet by a small company in Ann Arbor, Mich. - was one of several gateways that hackers tested to delve deeply into JPMorgan's internal systems. Ultimately, the hackers found multiple entry points, the people said, but the race website was not among them. One route that proved somewhat successful was through an older human resources system at the bank. Patricia Wexler, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, emphasized that the race website was ""unconnected to our systems and contained no information about our network."" The attackers' persistence in scanning every JPMorgan system and vendor for possible weaknesses exposes a stark new reality for American corporations. They are under almost constant siege by online criminals, and their computer networks, security analysts worry, have become ""too big to secure."" Every single system and every single vendor - even those as seemingly innocuous as a website for a charitable race - can be chinks in the most heavily fortified institutions. ""Any organization with a sophisticated information technology system needs to connect its system to systems in other organizations,"" said Herbert S. Lin, a computer expert at the National Research Council. The trade-off is ""even if the first organization's system is very secure, vulnerabilities in these other systems provide a route for an attacker."" He added, ""These other organizations are ones that you would least expect to be targets of serious attackers, like the janitorial suppliers or the food vendors."" In attack after attack, Mr. Lin and other security experts note that when the hackers' frontal assault fails, they almost always turn to a company's vendors. At Target last year, for example, hackers used credentials from the retailer's heating and cooling vendor to gain access to its systems. At a large oil company, hackers took a more creative approach, planting malware in the online takeout menu of a Chinese restaurant frequented by its employees. JPMorgan has maintained that there has been no evidence of fraud arising from the breaches. Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, highlighted the need for greater collaboration and control in the digital security landscape, including over vendors, during an earnings call on Tuesday. Guarding against breaches, he said, goes beyond the bank's own defenses. ""It's making sure that all of your vendors you deal with have proper cybercontrol, that all the exchanges have proper cybercontrol,"" said Mr. Dimon, who did not specifically mention the Corporate Challenge website. ""We have identified this as a huge effort. We've been very good at it until this recent breach, which we are not going to make excuses for."" As the intrusion at JPMorgan reverberated across Wall Street last week, with news that the same hackers who breached JPMorgan also tried to attack at least a dozen other large financial institutions but were largely thwarted, questions proliferated about why the attacks succeeded at JPMorgan, which has plowed hundreds of millions of dollars into its digital defenses. Within JPMorgan, some people wondered whether the attempted intrusions at other financial institutions were little more than a smoke screen, meant to obscure the real target, according to people with knowledge the investigations. ""We don't have any indication that the hackers got into JPMorgan through a third-party vendor,"" Ms. Wexler said. ""We are unaware of any other third-party-vendor-run site that was breached."" The identity of the vendor that managed the Corporate Challenge website has not been disclosed by either JPMorgan or Online Tech, the company that provided its connection to the Internet and provided security for the vendor's server. Online Tech, which said it sold space to the vendor for its server, learned of the Corporate Challenge website breach just this week when contacted by a reporter. Online Tech also did not know the vendor was managing a website for JPMorgan. The vendor also never notified Online Tech that hackers had infiltrated the race website. But that is not unusual in the Internet-hosting business, says a person familiar with industry practices. The vendor managing the Corporate Challenge website did not buy a specialized security package offered by Online Tech. It is unclear what security systems the vendor used on its own, but the Online Tech security package - which includes firewall and antivirus protection, log and file monitoring, vulnerability scanning and two-factor authentication - could have made it easier for the hosting company to detect the intrusion earlier. ""The client hosting the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge website chose to manage their own monitoring and security and not purchase any of our security and compliance services,"" said Shawn Fergus, director of marketing for Online Tech, which has more 300 customers. ""This does not mean that safeguards were not in place."" Mr. Fergus noted that, to the company's knowledge, no other client of Online Tech was affected by the breach of the Corporate Challenge website. At least one person with knowledge of the investigation said hackers might have been able to breach the site using some user names and passwords that were stolen by a Russian crime ring. Hold Security, a Milwaukee firm, said in August that it had discovered that a band of Russian cybercriminals had stolen more than a billion passwords and 500 million email addresses from more than 420,000 websites. The developments, security analysts say, underline the challenges for corporations in monitoring the security of outside vendors. Mr. Dimon acknowledged last week that the $250 million a year that JPMorgan is spending on online security may not be enough to deal with the problem, and he expects the bank to roughly double that over the next few years. It also remains unclear whether an exodus of some important security personnel from JPMorgan to First Data, a payment-processing company, left the bank vulnerable to a breach, the people with knowledge of the investigation said. Over the last several months, several staff members followed Frank Bisignano, JPMorgan's former co-chief operating officer, toFirst Data, including its digital security czar, Anthony Belfiore. Dozens of other lower-level security employees also made the move to First Data, but most of Mr. Belfiore's team remained at the bank. In June - coincidentally, just as it is thought the attack was beginning - the bank hired Greg Rattray, a former Air Force official who specializes in online defense, as its new head of information security. JPMorgan is continuing to hire as it bolsters its digital security. A review of LinkedIn found about a dozen job postings for online security over the last two months, including positions for experts in detecting web malware and data security engineering. But the bank, like most other large corporations in its predicament, may have a hard time. ""The reality is, everyone is hiring security professionals,"" said Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher, ""and there aren't really enough to go around."" Trading Revenue Lifts JPMorgan Chase Back to Profit in 3rd Quarter Obama Had Security Fears on JPMorgan Data Breach  Michael Corkery contributed reporting.  An earlier version of this article described imprecisely the relationship between the vendor responsible for the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge website and Online Tech, a small company in Ann Arbor, Mich. Online Tech provides power, the Internet connection and space for the vendor's server; it does not host the website on its own servers.                   "
Sony Pictures Computers Down for a Second Day After Network Breach,"Sony Pictures Entertainment's computer systems were down for the second day in a row Tuesday after hackers claimed responsibility for breaching the company's network and defacing its website.   On Monday, Sony Pictures was forced to take its systems offline after its website momentarily displayed an ominous image of a red skeleton that said ""Hacked by #GOP"" - an abbreviation that reportedly stands for Guardians of Peace. In their message, hackers warned that they had obtained internal corporate data and ""top secrets"" and threatened to leak them unless their demands were met. It was not clear what the hackers' requests were. ""We've already warned you,"" the hackers said in their message. ""We continue until our request be met. We've obtained all your internal data including your secrets and top secrets. If you don't obey us, we'll release data shown below to the world.""  There was not yet evidence that the data had been released.  Sony has attributed the problem to ""a system disruption."" The breach did not appear to affect Sony Pictures Animation, Sony Music Entertainment and other parts of the Sony Corporation. But within Sony Pictures, employees were still unable to get access to the company's internal network Tuesday afternoon.  Emails sent to Sony Pictures employees bounced back on Tuesday. ""Our email system is currently experiencing a disruption,"" the return message read. ""Please contact the person you wish to reach via office or mobile phone. Please do not reply to this email."" The breach was the second time that Sony Corporation had been targeted by hackers. In 2011, hackers broke into the online network for Sony's PlayStation game console, exposing names and credit card numbers for millions of customers.  Sony initially estimated the cost of that breach alone would cost $170 million, but that figure did not include the total cost of 50 class-action lawsuits, which sought up to $2 billion in damages.

Reinventing the Internet to Make It Safer,"SAN FRANCISCO - What if it isn't too late to start from scratch? It was only about 40 years ago that Vinton G. Cerf and Robert E. Kahn holed up in the conference room of a Hyatt hotel in Palo Alto, Calif., and sketched out the sets of rules and protocols that laid the foundation of the modern Internet. Despite big advances in speed, performance, memory and machines, their decisions continue to form the basis for modern digital communications - much to the detriment of security, some experts argue.  But the United States government is teaming up with computer scientists to do something about it. Five years ago, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, decided to explore what the Internet might look like if we could rebuild the computer systems from the ground up, employing the hard lessons we have learned about security. The idea was simple, yet seemingly impossible. The program, called Clean Slate, consisted of two separate but related efforts: Crash - short for Clean-Slate Design of Resilient, Adaptive, Secure Hosts - a multiyear project aimed at building systems that were much harder to break into, that could continue to fully function when they were breached and that could heal themselves, and MRC, short for Mission-Oriented Resilient Clouds, which applied similar thinking to computer networking and cloud computing. While Clean Slate was designed to make machines more aware of their environment, a separate effort at Darpa, called Active Authentication, is intended to make machines more aware of their operator. The program is exploring ways that machines could recognize humans by analyzing behavior, like a typing pattern, rather than a password or a fingerprint. The Clean Slate programs were designed to run for only four years. The Crash program finished last year, though three of its projects have continued for a fifth year. The MRC program will wrap up this year. With the advent of cloud computing and shiny new phones, tablets and watches, it can be easy to forget that in many ways our computer systems are still very old. ""The software we run, the programming language we use and the architecture of the chips we use haven't changed much in over 30 years,"" Howard E. Shrobe, a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a recent phone interview. Dr. Shrobe and others note that the Internet's basic design decisions were made when computer hardware was significantly more expensive than it is today. Forty years later, the consequences of decisions made in those resource-constrained days remain. ""Everything was built with performance, not security, in mind,"" Dr. Shrobe said. ""We left it to programmers to incorporate security into every line of code they wrote. One little mistake is all it takes for the bad guy to get in."" Never before has the problem been laid so bare. Last spring, security researchers stumbled on a two-year-old mistake a programmer had made in a critical piece of security software used by companies like Amazon, Netflix and Yahoo as well as by the F.B.I. and the Pentagon. It was built into a range of technology from weapons systems to home Wi-Fi routers. They called it Heartbleed. Five months later, researchers discovered another serious error, this one in a program run by 70 percent of the machines that connect to the Internet. Only this time, it had taken 22 years to discover the bug, which could be used to seize control of hundreds of millions of computers. They named it Shellshock. Together, the Heartbleed and Shellshock bugs affected more than half the Internet, putting web vulnerabilities in the limelight. But for security experts, the bugs were just further evidence that it may be time for a do-over. Dr. Shrobe, who oversaw the Clean Slate program for Darpa until last year, said that from the beginning he wanted the programs to be more than a thought experiment. ""It was always my intent to offer a menu of technical options that companies who make computers and computer software could introduce into the commercial stream,"" he said. ""We're beginning to see some of that work take effect now."" He points to one Crash program called Clean Slate Trustworthy Secure Research and Development, which those involved with it nicknamed Custard. It is not a full replacement of existing infrastructure but a way to use software and other technologies to run computers in a safer mode that can sort out who has permission to conduct which operations. ""It is a huge, phenomenal step forward,"" said Peter G. Neumann, a computer security pioneer at SRI International, the Silicon Valley engineering research laboratory that worked with Cambridge University on the Custard project. Dr. Neumann and Dr. Shrobe say Custard can eliminate an entire class of cyberattacks caused by buffer overflows, a common design flaw that allows hackers to send a message that overwhelms a computer's memory, causing the program to fail and allowing the attacker to inject malicious code. Over the last year, there has been significant and growing interest from companies in using Custard in their products, as well as from nonprofits, research communities and academia. While nobody expects an entirely new Internet infrastructure to emerge in 2016, Dr. Shrobe and others say they see demand building for a long-term solution to computer security. And there may be a window to do it as the world's computing goes mobile and the Internet braces for the Internet of Things - the hundreds of millions of cars, shoes, thermostats and lampposts that will soon be online. ""Everyone has been burned by now,"" Dr. Shrobe said. ""People are much more aware of the problem. The question is, What do you do now?""                       "
"Sony's Dirty Laundry, for All to See","LOS ANGELES -- Salaries of its top executives. Unpublished scripts. Sensitive contracts. Aliases that stars use to check into hotels. Those are just some of the disclosures from a devastating hacking attack on Sony's movie studio last month. But among all of the information that has spilled forth, perhaps nothing has riveted Hollywood more -- and laid bare the machinations at the highest levels of the film industry -- than a humiliating email exchange between Amy Pascal, Sony's co-chairwoman, and the producer Scott Rudin over Angelina Jolie and a planned Steve Jobs biopic. On Wednesday, Sony was scrambling to cope with the fallout from the incendiary emails posted by Gawker, the tabloid news site, that revealed an ugly internal battle over ''Jobs,'' an Aaron Sorkin-scripted biopic of the Apple co-founder. Mr. Rudin, who is widely known for his razor-toothed missives and temper, was upset that his favored director for the picture, David Fincher, was being pulled by Ms. Jolie toward a competing Sony movie, a remake of ''Cleopatra'' with Ms. Jolie in the title role. Mr. Rudin referred to Ms. Jolie as ''a minimally talented spoiled brat'' and pressured Ms. Pascal to shelve ''Cleopatra.''  Ms. Pascal at times tried to calm Mr. Rudin, whose company is supported financially under a deal with Sony, writing, ''This doesn't need to get crazy.'' By the end, however, ''Jobs'' had moved to Universal, and Mr. Rudin, according to the emails, told Ms. Pascal that she had ''behaved abominably, and it will be a very, very long time before I forget what you did.'' Ms. Pascal then wrote a lieutenant to ''get rid of him,'' an apparent reference to Mr. Rudin's deal. Ms. Pascal declined a request to discuss the exchange. A spokesman for Ms. Jolie said she had no comment. ''This is not about salacious emails being batted around by Gawker and Defamer,'' Mr. Rudin said on Wednesday. ''It's about a criminal act, and the people behind it should be treated as nothing more nor less than criminals.'' For Michael Lynton, the chief executive of a music, television and movies unit called Sony Entertainment, the hacking scandal has ensnared him and his company at a time when he was supposed to be on a victory lap. Some in the film industry have speculated that he soon planned to climb the corporate ladder into a job that would add to his responsibilities, perhaps to coincide with a planned move of his home base from Los Angeles to New York. Mr. Lynton declined through a spokesman to address that talk on Wednesday, but one person briefed on his plans said no change in his corporate responsibilities was in the works. Recently, Mr. Lynton had won a battle with the activist investor Daniel S. Loeb, who sought improved profitability. The studio announced layoffs, cut its budget, recruited fresh executive talent, and secured much-needed outside movie financing. In early November, Sony confidently projected that revenue would rise by a third over the next three years. But now Mr. Lynton is instead scrambling to advise both his superiors at the Sony Corporation in Japan and his employees on the studio's Culver City, Calif., lot as to the extent of the damage and of steps he and they must take to contain it over the coming weeks and perhaps years. Some computer systems remain down for fear of reinfecting them, and the studio could be two to three months away from restoring all of them. The studio is insured against at least some of its losses. The final tab is likely to be much less than the $100 million-plus estimates that have been floated by outsiders, one person briefed on the studio's situation said. People briefed on Mr. Lynton's movements said he returned at midweek from a long-planned trip to Japan, where he discussed business strategy and the breach. On Friday, he is expected to address a rare mass gathering of employees. A veteran of the publishing industry, Mr. Lynton was named chairman of Sony Pictures, a post he still holds, in 2003. In April 2013, the studio said it had renewed his employment contract, but did not disclose its terms. Executives at Sony say Mr. Lynton has been methodically but quietly engaged since the beginning of the attack -- a posture that matches his notably cerebral approach to studio management. At his studio, marching orders are for a rapid return to business as usual. In that spirit, the studio has rejected any notion that it should scrap ''The Interview,'' a planned comedy, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, about the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, though hackers who identified themselves as the Guardians of Peace appear to cite the film as a reason for the attack. On Wednesday, senior movie executives at Sony insisted that ''The Interview'' would be released as planned on Christmas, but acknowledged that additional security had been ordered for a premiere on Thursday in downtown Los Angeles. Security experts and law enforcement continue to search for the attackers, who may never be found. ''Attribution is very difficult until there has been a full analysis and even then, it can be impossible,'' said Liam O'Murchu, a senior security research manager at Symantec, the security company. Speaking at a cybersecurity conference on Tuesday, Joseph Demarest, the assistant director with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's cyber division, said only, ''There is no attribution to North Korea at this point.'' The attacks on Sony were orchestrated by command and control centers across the world, including computers at a convention center in Singapore and one at Thammasat University in Thailand, as well as others in Cyprus, Poland, Italy, the United States and Bolivia. Mr. Lynton and other senior Sony executives have so far not spoken publicly, but memos to employees have been leaked to the media. On Sunday -- perhaps in an effort to counter reports that Sony had been lax with its computer security -- Mr. Lynton sent a companywide bulletin quoting Kevin Mandia, the chief executive of Mandiant, an online security firm hired to help Sony recover. ''The scope of this attack differs from any we have responded to in the past,'' Mr. Mandia wrote. ''The bottom line is that this was an unparalleled and well-planned crime, carried out by an organized group, for which neither SPE'' -- Sony Pictures Entertainment -- ''nor other companies could have been fully prepared.'' Representatives from the F.B.I., which has been leading the investigation into the culprits, were on Sony's Culver City lot on Wednesday to brief employees about online security. Some Sony employees have watched in recent days as their identities have been stolen; the leaked information has been used to open false mortgage accounts and even buy women's handbags at Beverly Hills boutiques. The crisis recalled an episode 20 years ago when about 200 pages of the studio's financial documents were leaked to the trade publication Variety. Alan J. Levine, then Sony's chief operating officer, threatened legal action if the numbers were printed; with that, and some backdoor bargaining, the problem was nipped. ''I couldn't even dream of how big a nightmare this might be,'' Mr. Levine said on Wednesday. ''This could actually just be the tip of the iceberg.'' "
Sony and Mr. Kim's Thugs,"Sony Pictures pulled the movie ''The Interview'' after large theater chains said they would not show it, fearing threats of violence to their customers and employees by hackers believed to be working for the North Korean government. Though the companies are understandably cautious, this decision will establish a dangerous precedent that could further embolden rogue regimes and criminals. ''The Interview'' is a comedy about a C.I.A. plot to assassinate the dictator who rules North Korea, Kim Jong-un, using two hapless TV journalists played by Seth Rogen, who also co-directed the movie, and James Franco. Had it been made about any other world leader, it might have elicited a few barbed statements, and possibly a ban by the country in question.  After a few weeks in theaters, the movie would have faded into obscurity. But it was about Mr. Kim, a despot who runs an isolated and impoverished country that is held together by fear and propaganda about the greatness of its supreme leader. North Korean hackers, seeking revenge for the movie, stole millions of documents, including emails, health records and financial information that they dished out to the world. As the Christmas release of ''The Interview'' approached, the hackers said the film's release would result in bloodshed and evoked the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Even though the Department of Homeland Security said there was ''no credible intelligence'' of a threat to theaters, major chains like AMC, Regal and Cinemark said they would not show the film. And on Wednesday Sony threw in the towel, saying it ''has no further release plans.'' Even a movie studio aware of Mr. Kim's megalomania could not have fully anticipated this crime and the threats that followed. Unfortunately, Sony's capitulation sends a signal to Mr. Kim and other criminals that they can succeed in extortion if they are creative and devious enough. Corporate executives are now rightly fearing increased hacking attacks against their computer systems. Corporations, even large ones like Sony, cannot stand up to a rogue state and shadowy hacker armies all by themselves. That's why the Obama administration needs to take a strong stand on this and future attacks. Officials said on Thursday that they were considering a ''proportional response.'' Retaliation by the Obama administration over this attack would risk escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula and between North Korea and Japan, where Sony's corporate parent is based. However, there are things the United States can do. Although there are already heavy sanctions on North Korea, there may be ways to inflict more economic pain. Washington could seek an international panel to investigate the attack and demand condemnation by the United Nations Security Council. The United States also needs to work with Japan and South Korea, two other regular targets of North Korean hacking, to improve their defenses and develop common responses like imposing sanctions. China, North Korea's main ally and benefactor, remains the best check on the Kim regime; experts say most North Korean hackers are based in China. But China has its own history of hacking American government and industry computers and has resisted Washington's requests for talks on how to handle hacking attacks and their aftermath. The international community needs to speed up work on norms on what constitutes a cyberattack and what the response should be. If China and the United States are unable to work together in this critical area, the Internet will become a free-for-all and everyone will pay the price. As for ''The Interview,'' threats from North Korea are unlikely to prevent its viewing, and the worldwide publicity might even increase its potential audience. The scene of the movie that shows the assassination of Mr. Kim's character is already available online. It would not be surprising for Sony to eventually sell the movie to a streaming company like Netflix. Or someone might find a way to put a copy of it onto file-sharing sites where it would be impossible for Mr. Kim's hackers to contain. As many businesses have learned, it is hard to keep things off the Internet. "
Was Sony Right to Cancel 'The Interview' After Receiving a Threat Against Theaters?,"Sony Pictures announced this week that it was canceling its Christmas Day release of the action-comedy film ""The Interview,"" starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, which includes a scene depicting the leader of North Korea getting assassinated. The studio took the unusual step after hackers delivered vague but menacing threats against movie theaters. North Koreans have called the movie an ""act of war.""  Did Sony make the right decision in canceling the release of ""The Interview""? In ""Sony Drops 'The Interview' Following Terrorist Threats,"" Brooks Barnes and Michael Cieply write: Sony Pictures Entertainment on Wednesday dropped plans for its Christmas Day release of ""The Interview,"" a movie that depicts the assassination of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, after receiving a terror threat against theaters. Before that, the four largest theater chains in the United States said they would not show the movie, which has been at the center of a devastating hacking attack on Sony over the last several weeks. In a statement, Sony said: ""We respect and understand our partners' decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theatergoers."" American intelligence officials on Wednesday concluded that the North Korean government was centrally involved with the attacks on Sony's computers. That determination and the cancellation of the film were new twists in a series of developments that has found a major studio fighting for its art, and perhaps life, against forces driven by a foreign government. Shortly before Sony stepped back, AMC Theaters, citing a need for customers to ""plan their holiday moviegoing with certainty and confidence,"" joined Regal Entertainment, Cinemark and Carmike Cinemas in dropping the film. Together, those exhibitors control more than 19,200 screens across the United States. Smaller chains in the United States and Canada's Cineplex Entertainment also canceled bookings.  Students: Read the entire article, then tell us... - Did Sony make the right decision in canceling ""The Interview"" after receiving a terror threat against theaters? Why? - Many in Hollywood expressed dismay that hackers, most likely backed by a foreign government, could force a studio to cancel a movie. Does Sony's decision threaten First Amendment freedoms? Does it set an unhealthy precedent for future movies, books or other works of art that other countries don't like?   - Should the United States government retaliate against North Korea for the cyberattack and threats, if it is determined that the North Korean government is behind the hacking? - ""To depict the killing of a sitting world leader, comically or otherwise, is virtually without precedent in major studio movies, film historians say,"" according to the article. Is the film in bad taste? Does North Korea have a right to be offended?  - Would you want your local theater to show this movie? Would you go see it, given the threats that hackers made against theaters? Are you interested in seeing the movie?  Students 13 and older are invited to comment below.

North Korea and the Speech Police,"OF course it had to escalate this way. We live in a time of consistent gutlessness on the part of institutions notionally committed to free speech and intellectual diversity, a time of canceled commencement invitations and C.E.O.s defenestrated for their political donations, a time of Twitter mobs, trigger warnings and cringing public apologies. A time when journalists and publishers tiptoe around Islamic fundamentalism, when free speech is under increasing pressure on both sides of the Atlantic, when a hypersensitive political correctness has the whip hand on many college campuses. So why should anyone be remotely surprised that Kim Jong-un decided to get in on the ''don't offend me'' act?     Let's get some qualifiers out of the way. The North Korean regime is arguably more evil than any other present-day dictatorship, its apparent hack of Sony Pictures is a deadly serious act of cyberterrorism, and the response by Sony -- the outright withdrawal, after theater chains balked at showing it, of the offending comedy, ''The Interview,'' in which the North Korean dictator is blown to smithereens -- sets a uniquely terrible precedent.    It's terrible for cinema, since the film industry, already wary of any controversy that might make its blockbusters hard to sell in Asia, will no doubt retreat even further into the safety of superhero franchises. More important, it's terrible for any future institution or individual hacked or blackmailed by groups seeking similar concessions.   So the Sony affair is more serious than many other debates about speech and power in the West right now. But the difference is still one of magnitude, not kind.    After all, the basic strategy employed by the apparently North Korean-backed hackers is the same one employed for years by Islamic extremists against novelists and newspapers and TV shows that dare to portray the Prophet Muhammad in a negative light (or in any light at all). And the weak response from Hollywood, where the town's movers and shakers proved unwilling to even sign a George Clooney-organized public petition pledging solidarity against the hackers, isn't so very different from the self-censorship by networks and publishers and even opera houses that have fallen afoul of Islamist sensitivities over the years.    Moreover, the demand that ''The Interview'' be withdrawn because it treats North Korea disrespectfully -- as it most certainly does -- isn't all that different from the arguments behind the various speech codes that have proliferated in Europe and Canada of late, exposing people to fines and prosecution for speaking too critically about the religions, cultures and sexual identities of others.    Nor is it all that different from the arguments used in the United States to justify canceling an increasing number of commencement speakers -- including Condoleezza Rice and Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Christine Lagarde -- when some hothouse-flower campus activists decided they couldn't bear to sit and hear them. Or the mentality that forced out the C.E.O. and co-founder of Mozilla, Brendan Eich, when it was revealed that he had once donated money to a ballot initiative that opposed same-sex marriage. Or the free-floating, shape-shifting outrage that now pervades the Internet, always looking for some offensive or un-P.C. remark to fasten on and furiously attack -- whether the perpetrator is a TV personality or some unlucky political staffer, hapless and heretofore obscure.   The common thread in all these cases, whether the angry parties are Hermit Kingdom satraps or random social-justice warriors on Twitter, is a belief that the most important power is the power to silence, and that the perfect community is one in which nothing uncongenial to your own worldview is ever tweeted, stated, supported or screened.   And the other common thread, of course, is the pathetic response from the cultural entities that are supposedly most invested in free speech in our culture -- universities, Internet companies, the press and the film industry, all of which seem disinclined to risk much on behalf of the ideals they officially cherish.   As a conservative, you take for granted that these institutions are often political monocultures -- that the average commencement speaker, like the average academic, will be several degrees left of center, that Silicon Valley isn't the most hospitable place to be a religious conservative, that when Hollywood gets ''edgy'' or ''controversial'' it's usually a right-wing ox that's being gored.   But it would be far easier to live with this predictable liberalism if these institutions, so pious about their commitment to free expression, weren't so quick to knuckle under to illiberalism in all its varied forms.    ''We cannot have a society,'' President Obama said on Friday, when asked about the Sony hack, ''where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States.''    In theory, that's absolutely right. But in practice, Kim Jong-un has our culture's number: Letting angry people impose a little censorship is just the way we live right now.    "
Security Council Examines North Korea's Human Rights,"UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations Security Council for the first time turned its attention to human rights in North Korea on Monday, as Pyongyang and Washington traded accusations over a hacking attack against a Hollywood studio, and North Korea's already limited connection to the Internet went down completely. North Korea chose not to speak at the Council briefing, which focused largely on a United Nations inquiry that had found widespread and systematic human rights abuses, including forced starvation, enslavement and rape. Instead, in a letter to the world body, North Korea described the Council briefing as the product of a ''hostile policy pursued by the United States.'' It went on to threaten the resumption of nuclear tests.  China, which is North Korea's principal ally on the 15-member Council, sought to prevent the briefing, arguing that the Council had no business looking into one country's human rights record. It lost that bid. The Australian ambassador, Gary Quinlan, rebutted that claim by citing the hacking attack against the studio, Sony Pictures, which he said showed North Korea's ability to ''destabilize other countries and international commerce.'' He was referring to a break-in of the computers at Sony in retaliation for its satirical film ''The Interview,'' about a fictitious plot to assassinate the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The Obama administration has blamed North Korea for the Sony attack and promised to respond. North Korea has denied involvement and made new threats against the United States should the White House retaliate. On Monday, just before the Council meeting began, came reports that North Korea's Internet had gone dark. The Monday briefing was an outcome of a landmark report by a United Nations Commission of Inquiry chronicling widespread and systematic abuses, including infanticide, executions and torture in North Korean prison camps. The report was based on interviews with North Korean exiles, whom the North Koreans described in a letter to the United Nations as ''human scum.'' The report recommended that the Security Council refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court for possible prosecution of Mr. Kim and others. Several Council members on Monday suggested support for the idea, including the United States, which has not itself signed the treaty that created the court. Any such referral is highly unlikely, given China's veto power. Still, North Korea's newly established presence on the Council's agenda means that it can come up for discussion repeatedly. The Commission of Inquiry report caused a flurry of diplomatic attention on North Korea. Secretary of State John Kerry convened a meeting on North Korean rights abuses on the sidelines of the General Assembly last September. The chief of the Commission of Inquiry sparred with a North Korean diplomat at a public meeting here last October. And last week, the United Nations General Assembly urged the Security Council to take up the situation in North Korea, including a referral of the country to the International Criminal Court. The United Nations assistant secretary general, Ivan Simonovic, said of the report: ''Rarely has such an extensive charge-sheet of international crimes been brought to this Council's attention.'' At the meeting, China's representative, Liu Jieyi, urged the Council to focus on ridding the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons instead. The United States ambassador, Samantha Power, seemed to suggest that human rights were not worth trading for a nuclear deal. ''That is a false choice,'' she said. China objected to the meeting, which led to an unusual procedural vote -- the first in eight years -- on whether the meeting should be held. Only Russia agreed with China; Chad and Nigeria abstained; the other 11 members, including the United States, voted in favor. Rights activists who have long pressed for North Korean accountability said the meeting itself was an important advance. ''Today, the Security Council signaled that Pyongyang's decades-long regime of massive cruelty against its own people must end,'' said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch. ''By placing North Korea's appalling human rights record on its agenda, the Council can now at any point take the next step of referring these crimes against humanity to the I.C.C.'' "
Countering Cyberattacks Without a Playbook,"WASHINGTON -- For years now, the Obama administration has warned of the risks of a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor,'' a nightmare attack that takes out America's power grids and cellphone networks and looks like the opening battle in a full-scale digital war. Such predictions go back at least 20 years, and perhaps that day will come. But over the past week, a far more immediate scenario has come into focus, first on the back lots of Sony Pictures and then in back-to-back strategy sessions in the White House Situation Room: a shadow war of nearly constant, low-level digital conflict, somewhere in the netherworld between what President Obama called ''cybervandalism'' and what others might call digital terrorism. In that murky world, the attacks are carefully calibrated to be well short of war. The attackers are hard to identify with certainty, and the evidence cannot be made public. The counterstrike, if there is one, is equally hard to discern and often unsatisfying. The damage is largely economic and psychological. Deterrence is hard to establish. And because there are no international treaties or norms about how to use digital weapons -- indeed, no acknowledgment by the United States government that it has ever used them itself -- there are no rules about how to fight this kind of conflict.  ''Until now, we've been pretty ad hoc in figuring out what's an annoyance and what's an attack,'' James Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week. ''If there's a lesson from this, it's that we're long overdue'' for a national discussion about how to respond to cyberattacks -- and how to use America's own growing, if unacknowledged, arsenal of digital weaponry. All those issues have been swirling in the background in the drama of North Korea's effort to intimidate Sony Pictures, and the retaliation by the United States -- if that was the case -- against one of its oldest Cold War adversaries. ''If you had told me that it would take a Seth Rogen movie to get our government to really confront these issues, I would have said you are crazy,'' one senior defense official said a few days ago, referring to the Sony Pictures film ''The Interview.'' ''But then again, this whole thing has been crazy.'' With Tuesday's announcement that ''The Interview,'' a crude and poorly reviewed comedy about a C.I.A. effort to hire two bumbling journalists to knock off Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, will be shown in a limited number of theaters, it is very possible that this confrontation with the least predictable of the nine nations possessing nuclear weapons may not yet be over. Like most cyberattacks, it started with a simple question: Who did it? But this was no ordinary effort to steal credit card data, like what happened at Target and Home Depot. What made the attack on Sony different was its destructive nature. By some accounts, it wiped out roughly two-thirds of the studio's computer systems and servers -- one of the most destructive cyberattacks on American soil. It took three weeks for Mr. Obama to take the extraordinarily rare step of publicly identifying North Korea, and its leadership, as the culprit. And even now, the F.B.I. refuses to release much of its evidence, presumably because it could reveal the degree to which the United States had penetrated North Korea's networks and the Chinese systems through which they are routed. The president's decision to also mention the Chinese during a news conference last week in which he responded to the Sony attack was ''itself part of the effort to create some deterrence,'' one administration official said, ''by making it clear we can cut through the fog.'' But because the government will not make the evidence public, there will be doubters. ''The N.S.A. has been trying to eavesdrop on North Korea's government communications since the Korean War, and it's reasonable to assume that its analysts are in pretty deep,'' Bruce Schneier, one of the country's leading cyberexperts, wrote in The Atlantic, referring to the National Security Agency. ''The agency might have intelligence on the planning process for the hack. It might, say, have phone calls discussing the project, weekly PowerPoint status reports, or even Kim Jong-un's sign-off on the plan.'' ''On the other hand, maybe not,'' he wrote. ''I could have written the same thing about Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction program.'' But Washington's declaration that North Korea was the source came paired with Mr. Obama's warning of a ''proportionate response.'' Within days, North Korean Internet connections sputtered and went dead -- and after briefly reviving, they were out again on Tuesday. An American attack? Did the Chinese pull the plug? Did the North Koreans take themselves offline to protect themselves? No one in Washington will say. But it is possible that to deter future attacks, the administration was not looking for subtlety. Instead, it might have simply wanted to remind Mr. Kim that the United States is training 6,000 ''cyberwarriors'' among its military units, and they all have North Korea's Internet Protocol address. Still, if North Korea did bear the brunt of an American counterstrike -- a significant ''if'' -- it will most likely prove more symbolic than anything else and serve to remind Mr. Kim that his family has miscalculated before. In the summer of 1950, gambling that the Americans were too distracted to respond, the founder of the country, Kim Il-sung, invaded the South. It turned out he was wrong, and the devastating three-year conflict that followed ruined his nation. But, improbably, it left him and his family in power. Over the past two years, his grandson -- who has tailored his appearance to closely resemble the North's revered Great Leader, who died 20 years ago -- has embraced digital weapons precisely because they are far more subtle than sending troops over the 38th Parallel. In fact, cyberweapons are perfect for a failing state. Unlike North Korea's small arsenal of six to 12 nuclear weapons, they can be used without risking an annihilating response. Unlike North Korea's missile fleet, they are uncannily accurate. Just ask Sony, which is still trying to figure out whether its attackers had inside knowledge or just got lucky. But that leaves Mr. Obama with a ''short of war'' conundrum. How much American power should be deployed to stop a cybervandal from becoming a cyberterrorist? Until the past week, the president's temptation has been to refrain from responding at all. But the combination of the destructive attack, the effort to silence American criticism of a brutal regime and the threats of attacks on American theaters made this one different. The mystery now is whether the young, untested Mr. Kim will back off, or whether, like his grandfather, he will push ahead, figuring that an unpredictable North Korea has kept enemies at bay for six decades, and that his new weapon may extend the streak.

PlayStation Reconnects Gradually After Attack,"The Sony Corporation's PlayStation Network had connection problems for a fourth day since hackers attacked the video game network, and the company said on Sunday that service was gradually being restored.  The hacker activist group known as Lizard Squad has claimed responsibility for disrupting both the PlayStation Network and Microsoft Corporation's Xbox Live on Christmas Day. Service was restored to Xbox Live on Friday. ''We are currently experiencing widespread network issues that are being addressed,'' Sony said in a statement on PlayStation's maintenance website. Hours earlier, Catherine Jensen, vice president for consumer experience at Sony Computer Entertainment America, said on the PlayStation blog that the network was ''back online.'' Some gamers said on Twitter that they were able to gain access to the PlayStation Network on Sunday, but others took to the site to complain about the continuing cutoff. It was not clear how many of the 56 million video gamers who use PlayStation still suffered problems. On Sony's Twitter customer support account, AskPlayStation, a representative wrote, ''Network services are gradually coming back online.'' Sony has been the victim of some prominent security breaches. In late November, Sony Pictures' computer system was hacked in protest of the film ''The Interview,'' which depicted the assassination of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. President Obama has blamed the North Korean government for the attack. Lizard Squad has claimed responsibility for attacks on the PlayStation Network in early December and August of this year. In 2011, hackers stole data belonging to 77 million PlayStation Network users. "
Chinese Internet Traffic Redirected to Small Wyoming House,"In one of the more bizarre twists in recent Internet memory, a large portion of Internet traffic in China was redirected to a small, 1,700-square-foot house in Cheyenne, Wyo. on Tuesday. A large portion of China's 500 million Internet users were unable to load Web sites ending in .com, .net or .org for nearly eight hours in most regions of China, according to Compuware, a Detroit-based technology company. The China Internet Network Information Center, a state-run agency that deals with Internet affairs, said it had traced the problem to the country's domain name system. And one of China's biggest antivirus software vendors, Qihoo 360 Technology, said the problems affected roughly three quarters of the country's domain name system servers.  Those servers, which act as a switchboard for Internet traffic behind China's Great Firewall, routed traffic from some of China's most popular sites, including Baidu and Sina, to a block of Internet addresses registered to Sophidea Inc., a mysterious company housed on a residential street in Cheyenne, Wyoming. A simple Google search reveals that the address on Thomes Avenue in Cheyenne is not a corporate headquarters, but a 1,700-square-foot brick house with a  manicured lawn. That address - which is home to some 2,000 companies on paper - was the subject of a lengthy 2011 Reuters investigation which found that among the entities registered to the address were a shell company controlled by a jailed, former Ukraine prime minister; the owner of a company that helped online poker operators evade an Internet gambling ban, and one entity that was banned from government contracts after selling counterfeit truck parts to the Pentagon. Wyoming Corporate Services, the registered agent for Sophidea Inc. according to Internet records, did not return requests for comment Tuesday afternoon. It was not immediately clear what caused the traffic shift Tuesday. One Chinese newspaper suspected a cyberattack. But by late Tuesday, some technologists had come to an alternate theory: a backfiring of China's own Internet censoring system. Sophidea Inc. appears to be a service that redirects traffic from one address to another to mask a person's whereabouts - or to evade a firewall. Some technologists surmised Tuesday that the disruption may have been caused by Chinese Internet censors who attempted to block traffic to Sophidea's websites but mistakenly redirected traffic to the service instead. That theory was buttressed by the fact that a separate wave of Chinese Internet traffic Tuesday was simultaneously redirected to Internet addresses owned by Dynamic Internet Technology, a company that helps people evade China's Great Firewall, and is typically blocked in China. Bill Xia, who created Dynamic Internet Technology in 2001, told the Wall Street Journal Tuesday that his company had nothing to do with the traffic shift and also suspected that the problem was the doing of China's own Internet censors. The incident mirrored a similar mishap in 2002 when Chinese Internet users attempting to access Sina.com were redirected to a banned website belonging to followers of Falun Gong, a spiritual movement banned in China.  Nicole Perlroth reported from San Francisco. David Barboza contributed reporting from Shanghai.   "
IBM's Big Hope for Fraud,"IBM is changing with the crimes. So are other companies, and their collective efforts could affect more than catching tax cheats. On Thursday, IBM announced the creation of a fraud and financial crimes prevention business that combines big data analytics, business know-how and data visualization.  According to the research firm IDC, the global market for financial fraud detection is about $5 billion. IBM also intends to work in preventing health care fraud, like false claims. Target's loss of millions of credit card numbers last year is a good example of the hazard to companies and the opportunity for companies that can spot new threats. Hackers apparently entered Target's computers that held its customers' financial information by first gaining access to the computers associated with Target's heating and cooling system. As with many companies, all the machines were on the same network. Compared with traditional means for spotting frauds, like matching payments to lists of stolen credit cards, ""the challenge institutions have just begins with identification of threats,"" said Steven A. Mills, IBM's head of software and systems. He noted that online frauds and cyberattacks were frequently populated by ""collections of people engaged in comprehensive attacks."" IBM is not alone. Last October, Novetta Solutions, a company known mostly for government defense work, partnered with Teradata to provide corporations with cyberdefenses that include behavioral analysis. Palantir, a Palo Alto start-up firm that initially worked for intelligence services but increasingly does private sector work, in December announced a $100 million round of financing that valued the company at $9 billion. ""It's no longer suitable to detect and stop fraud; you have to understand the attackers, the relationships and the techniques,"" said Michael Versace, global research director at IDC. ""The fraud scenarios are getting more complex."" The challenge for IBM, he said, would be ""adding value while moving from legacy technology that is siloed in different parts of the bank."" Like most things IBM, the move involves lots of people and resources. IBM said it had more than 500 fraud experts in the new organization  and would draw on 290 fraud-related patents, as well as several large corporate acquisitions it has made in the last several years. ""Finding needles in haystacks is what we do,"" said Mr. Mills. ""We have a rich set of technologies, acquisitions and an understanding of technical domains."" Part of the problem in the new sleuthing is finding weak and indirect relationships among bad actors. For example, whether two frauds months apart made use of a similar server traffic configuration. Compared with a Palantir, he said, ""we do astrophysics. Finding fifth-, sixth-, seventh-, eighth-order relationships among weak signals is different."" The company is initially focusing on areas like banking, insurance and health care, but this kind of relationship spotting can have other uses. Mr. Mills said IBM might use the techniques in other areas, like industrial maintenance. ""You look for wear patterns among machines, predict when things will break,"" he said. ""This moves from industry to industry, scenario to scenario.""  "
Banks in U.S. Moving to Chip-Based Debit and Credit Cards,"In the coming year, banks in the United States are likely to replace debit or credit cards with versions that have tiny computer chips embedded in them, a move aimed at making shopping in stores more secure. Bank of America, for instance, has just announced that, beginning this month, all new bank customers will be issued debit cards with chip technology, and that existing cards will be upgraded as they expire. The cards work by creating a unique code for each transaction. While the change will not necessarily stop data breaches from occurring, security experts say, the chip technology prevents criminals from using stolen information to create counterfeit cards. Most credit and debit cards in the United States rely on older ''magnetic strip'' technology, which is vulnerable to hacking. Many big banks and credit unions have already been issuing chip-enabled credit cards to customers who travel overseas, where the technology is in wider use. The switch to chip-based debit cards has been slower, however, because of more complex payment networks used by those cards, said Julie Conroy, research director for retail banking at Aite Group. A recent spate of data breaches is helping to accelerate the change, however. Home Depot, for example, revealed last month that data from 56 million cards had been stolen in a breach of its computer network.  A spokesman for Chase said the bank already offered numerous credit cards with chips and expected most of its debit cards to be chip-enabled by the end of next year. Wells Fargo says it is testing chip technology with its debit cards and plans to issue them ''on a broad scale'' in the coming year. Citibank will begin issuing debit cards with chips in 2015, it said in an emailed statement. Citibank said that all of its new consumer credit cards were issued with chip technology, and that the bank was on track to have half of its portfolio of consumer credit cards chip-enabled by the end of this year. Most customers can request a chip credit card from the bank online or by calling customer service. There is a catch, however. Even if customers get a chip card now, they may not easily find a store that accepts it because retailers in the United States have lagged other countries in adopting payment terminals that can process the cards. Some major retailers like Whole Foods, Sam's Club and Costco already have the systems in place, said Ms. Conroy, but ''we're going to see cards hit the market more quickly than terminals.'' Most big stores are expected to have chip-compatible readers by October 2015. That is when the liability for card fraud that occurs on nonchip terminals will shift away from card-issuing banks, which now bear the brunt of fraud costs, to the merchants. Because of the staggered adoption, most of the chip cards being issued will have the magnetic strips as well, so they can be used even at stores that do not have upgraded card readers, said Rebecca Kastl, a senior consultant at Neohapsis, a security and risk management company. Here are some answers to questions about chip cards: â-  Is there anything different about how the chip cards are used? Unlike magnetic stripe cards, which are ''swiped'' at the cash register, chip cards are ''dipped'' into a reader and remain in the device for a few seconds while the transaction is approved. Customers need to remember to remove the card. Ms. Conroy of Aite Group said that when the cards were first deployed in Canada, some merchants ended up with a pile of cards left behind by forgetful customers. ''It's a behavioral change,'' she said. â-  Should I wait for my bank to replace my debit card, or ask for a chip card now? Paul Stephens of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer group, advises those who use debit cards to ask for a chip version as soon as it is available. Debit cards are linked directly to bank accounts and have less secure consumer protections than credit cards, he said, so it is important to use one with the latest security features. Banks typically cover losses from debit fraud if customers report a loss promptly. But, he warned, it can take up to two weeks for banks to restore the funds. â-  Will chip cards make online purchases safer? Chip cards mainly protect against fraud when customers are shopping in a store; they're less helpful for online shopping, since consumers are not using the actual plastic. In fact, analysts suspect there may be an uptick in online card fraud when chip cards become more prevalent, as criminals seek alternate ways to steal card data. So online stores may also consider further protections, like a special code sent to a customer's mobile phone that must be entered to complete a purchase. "
Kickstarter Acknowledges a Breach of User Data,"Kickstarter, the fund-raising platform used by millions of people to raise capital for creative projects and businesses, said over the weekend that hackers had gained access to some of its customers' data last week but that the breach had been repaired.  ''No credit card data of any kind was accessed by hackers,'' Kickstarter's chief executive, Yancey Strickler, wrote in a blog post on Saturday on the company's website. ''There is no evidence of unauthorized activity of any kind on all but two Kickstarter user accounts,'' he wrote. The post noted that the company's website does not store credit card data. Recent data breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus have raised concerns among lawmakers and the public over who should bear the cost of consumer losses and how to improve security online. The compromised Kickstarter information included user names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers and encrypted passwords, according to the company, which was informed of the breach by law enforcement officials last week. It added that while the passwords were not revealed, people with computer expertise could still decipher encrypted passwords, and recommended that users change their passwords as well as those for other sites or accounts for which the users had the same password. Kickstarter said it had increased security in recent days. It also said it was working with law enforcement officials. The company started in 2009 as a conduit for financing of projects as varied as films and stage shows, video games and restaurants. Contributors to a project's start-up are often compensated with rewards, discounts, credits or other offers from the projects they helped fund. Since Kickstarter's introduction, more than 100,000 projects have been funded, with hundreds of millions of dollars pledged. "
Trading Revenue Lifts JPMorgan Back to Profit in 3rd Quarter,"Updated, 8:35 p.m. | JPMorgan Chase reported on Tuesday that it swung to a profit in the third quarter thanks to better results from its Wall Street operations. The bank, the nation's largest, earned $5.57 billion in the quarter, or $1.36 a share, compared with a loss of $380 million, or 17 cents a share, in the period a year earlier, when huge legal and regulatory costs took their toll. The earnings in the latest quarter were hampered by the $1.1 billion the bank set aside for legal costs, much of it to deal with an investigation into potential manipulation of the foreign exchange market by the biggest banks. Those legal expenses lowered earnings by 26 cents a share and brought them below the profit of $1.38 a share that analysts had expected, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.  But most analysts were pleasantly surprised by the results turned in by JPMorgan's investment bankers and traders, who increased revenue even compared with a strong quarter a year ago. ''They appear to be executing quite well,'' said Erik Oja, a bank analyst at S&P Capital IQ. ''The Wall Street stuff all grew faster than the total top line did.'' Revenue for the company on a so-called managed basis rose 5 percent, to $25.2 billion, modestly higher than analysts had expected. The bank's stock fell 17 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $57.99. The relatively good results were somewhat marred by the unexpected release of the bank's quarterly report two hours before scheduled on Shareholder.com, an investor website owned by Nasdaq OMX that provides corporate services. The site took down the report but not before several news services reported the numbers early. A spokesman for Nasdaq OMX said that the errant timing was caused by ''human error internally at Shareholder.com.'' Still, the data's accidental release was an ungainly reminder of JPMorgan's own digital woes. The bank disclosed this month that a cyberattack over the summer had compromised the personal information of 76 million households and seven million small businesses. In a conference call on Tuesday, the bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said that the fight against hackers was going to be an ''ongoing battle.'' ''We do think that, unfortunately, there would be some wins and losses in this,'' Mr. Dimon said. ''This is not going to be one of those things where it's going to be absolute.'' He reiterated comments from last week that the bank would continue to increase spending on digital security. Mr. Dimon has recently been making his first public appearances since completing treatment for throat cancer, which he disclosed in July. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Dimon said, ''I feel good and I'm happy the treatments are over.'' Mr. Dimon also said that the bank continued to see a ''broad-based recovery'' in the United States economy. He added that recent turbulence in the global economy ''could slow down American growth a little bit, but we think you will still have growth in America.'' Overall lending at JPMorgan was up, driven by the improving outlook for United States businesses and consumers, and the credit quality among the bank's customers has been improving steadily since the financial crisis. JPMorgan's large consumer bank reported a slight increase in revenue despite a big slowdown in the number of people borrowing money to refinance their mortgages, which was feeding JPMorgan's bottom line until recently. Mortgage originations fell 48 percent from the period a year earlier but rose 26 percent from the previous quarter. The bank is on track to cut 6,000 employees from its mortgage operations this year. JPMorgan's enormous investment bank was helped by the buoyant market for mergers and acquisitions, which pushed advisory fees up 28 percent from the third quarter of 2013. Overall revenue in the corporate and investment bank rose 7 percent while profit fell 34 percent, largely as a result of legal costs but also because of the increased pool of money being set aside for employee compensation. The investment bank put aside $2.8 billion for compensation, up 20 percent from a year ago, suggesting that bank bonuses could rise this year. The trading desks that have long been among the biggest drivers of profit on Wall Street staged something of a recovery after several quarters of sluggish activity in the stock and bond markets. Revenue from JPMorgan's fixed-income trading operations rose 2 percent, to $3.5 billion, with strength seen in currencies and emerging markets. The other notable strong performance came from JPMorgan's asset-management business, which is viewed as a particularly promising business in the evolving regulatory landscape. The division increased its assets under management by 11 percent while revenue rose 9 percent. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Attackers Use Microsoft Security Hole Against Energy, Defense, Finance Targets","SAN FRANCISCO - By the time Microsoft warned customers of a nasty security hole in its web browser Saturday, a sophisticated group of attackers were already using the vulnerability against defense and energy companies, according to FireEye, the security company. Things went from bad to worse over the weekend. FireEye's researchers watched as the attackers shared their exploit with a separate attack group, which began using the vulnerability to target companies in the financial services industry, according to Darien Kindlund, the director of threat intelligence at FireEye.  Even after Microsoft issued its advisory on Saturday, Mr. Kindlund said, ""There was a notable increase in proliferation."" Soon, the attackers were using the vulnerability for so-called watering hole attacks, in which hackers infect a popular website with malware, then wait for victims to click to the site and infect their computers. Mr. Kindlund said FireEye believed the two attack groups were nation-state sponsored. While he said the company did not yet have conclusive evidence, based on the groups' previous campaigns it was believed they were operating from China. The vulnerability affected all versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser. Only those who had configured their browsers to run in enhanced protection mode were protected. The situation took on added urgency because Microsoft stopped supporting its Windows XP operating system last month, meaning that any devices running Windows XP would be permanently vulnerable to attack. Typically in its regular upgrade cycle, Microsoft waits to issue security fixes on the first Tuesday of every month - what system administrators call ""Patch Tuesday."" But given the gravity of the hole, Microsoft raced to issue a patch Thursday and decided to update Windows XP systems as well. ""The security of our products is something we take incredibly seriously,"" Adrienne Hall, the general manager of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing project, said in a statement on Thursday. ""When we saw the first reports about this vulnerability we decided to fix it, fix it fast, and fix it for all customers."" The timing of FireEye's discovery was fortuitous for the company, whose stock has tumbled 40 percent since a finding last month by NSS Labs, an independent research company, that FireEye's breach-detection systems underperformed similar offerings by Cisco Systems, Trend Micro and General Dynamics. NSS Labs actually issued a grade of ""caution"" to customers using FireEye's web and email malware protection systems. The findings set off an unusual back-and-forth online between NSS Labs and FireEye. Responding to the report in a blog post, Manish Gupta, FireEye's senior vice president for products, said NSS Labs' test environment did not match the real threat landscape. NSS Labs' researchers responded in a blog post of their own - titled ""Don't Shoot the Messenger.""  FireEye's stock, which had been trading at $65 before the NSS Labs report was released, has been tumbling and closed near $40 Thursday. Mr. Kindlund, of FireEye, said this week's discovery of the security hole in Internet Explorer was proof that isolated tests did not reflect real-world threats. A separate finding by NSS Labs released in March had found that Internet Explorer was more secure than Google's Chrome and Apple's Safari browser. ""Look, we're focused on protecting and defending against real-world attacks,"" Mr. Kindlund said. ""It's hard to model and test for that in any controlled way. Clearly, there's a disconnect between what's happening in the real world and what's currently being tested.""  "
"For Bitcoins or Dollars, the Value of Money Is Rooted in the Beliefs Behind It","How should we think about a currency like Bitcoin? The first thing to remember is this: Money is a sort of collective fiction. What money we choose to trust says much about how we see the world. Above the simplest exchanges, most money has limited use. Gold, the most common historical currency, is almost only good for adornment. To its fans, gold's uselessness is a value in itself; since the stock of gold is not consumed, it's reasonably stable, while governments can print all the currency they want. Paper is, of course, a proxy for the government issuing the money. How much we trust the government's ability to collect taxes, pay debts, and so on is the collective fiction that gives a country's money value. Paper or metal, money is worth something only if people continue to believe in it. And right now, an increasing number of people believe in Bitcoins and similar, emerging stateless currencies. From parity with the dollar three years ago, one Bitcoin is now just over $800.  Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist whose firm has invested just under $50 million in start-ups related to Bitcoin, has written a very helpful introduction to Bitcoin in DealBook. It is also a spirited defense of Bitcoin. Mind you, a sensible person should read the essay aware that Mr. Andreessen has a significant number of United States dollars bet on Bitcoin's increasing use. The journalist Glenn Fleishman, with whom Mr. Andreessen has been spiritedly debating Bitcoin on Twitter for several days, wrote a strong critique of Mr. Andreessen's thinking. Much of the argument is about the mathematics, or whether Bitcoin is deflationary, or the way in which the creation of new Bitcoins burns increasing amounts of electricity to no good end. So far, there is little discussion of what the collective decision to believe a fiction like Bitcoin might mean. In many ways, that is the more interesting phenomenon. Certainly, it is applicable not just to Bitcoin, but to Bitcoin proxies like Zerocoin or to other new stateless, math-based currencies, like Ripple. It also sharpens current preoccupations in the high-tech world. In the place of believing in a central bank, or its owner, a powerful nation state, what do we believe in when we believe in Bitcoin? Specifics around the algorithm, of course. More deeply, we believe in a borderless world of hyper-empowered individuals, alive mostly through the Internet. They are not gated by language, thanks to image sharing and Google Translate. Many have sent thousands of messages around the world, without ever using a sovereign nation's stamps. Many have never done national service in the physical world. Even more do not expect their children to fight in a country's wars, at least not as soldiers carrying arms. (Cyberwar is another matter, perhaps.) None of this bodes well for the relationship between the most wealthy, powerful and gifted, and their home nations. In a telling moment a few months ago, I asked three tech executives -- an American, a Czech and a Romanian -- the following question: If I threw down five passports from ''good'' countries, like Germany or Singapore, would you care which one you picked up? No one would. Their business is on the Internet, everywhere and nowhere, and they have friends all over the world. Charles Stross, the science fiction writer, wrote in a strong critique of Bitcoin that it has an inherently elitist, libertarian agenda. Alex Payne, another critic, wrote a piece slamming one of Mr. Andreessen's partners that took it farther, saying that belief in Bitcoin was another symptom of Silicon Valley's enormous self-regard. By those lights, the old fiction of the central bank is being swapped for the new collective fiction of the almighty tech elite. That idea settles in uncomfortably close to recent calls by some prominent tech executives to detach, as much as possible, from the old, failed nations. San Francisco's continuing antagonisms between tech workers and ''normal'' people takes on an even darker cast, once the protesters are seen as a crowd anxious at being left behind. There are also other fictions associated with other currencies. Ripple, developed after Bitcoin, hopes to be a kind of universal proxy currency, perhaps enabling the owner of a farm animal in Nepal to directly trade it for an iPhone in Britain, or American frequent-flyer miles to become gold in Mexico. ''People will decide what kind of things they want to hold,'' said Chris Larsen, the co-founder and chief executive of Ripple Labs, a company that is associated with the Ripple currency. ''We think there will be an explosion of different currencies.'' Ripple, the digital money, was created, open-sourced and put out into the world in a finite amount. Its presence is distributed over 50 servers on three continents, and all of them must agree on the rises or falls in the net value of the money. That should prevent the injection of new, inflationary Ripples being injected into the system. Even so, Mr. Larsen said that at this point it was ''clearly a speculative market.'' ''Is Bitcoin Friendster, and we're MySpace? I hope not,'' he said, referring to a pair of the earliest social networks. ''Are we still waiting for our Facebook? Possibly. People worry a lot about the dollar now.'' It may be, as Mr. Larsen says, that math-based systems have a kind of purity, ''the exchange of value within the exchange of information,'' without the messy stuff of nations getting in the way. It may also be that life stays messy, and these new systems learn how to accommodate that, possibly by agreeing to be taxed by one or another government. The language we use around money is telling. Words like ''currency,'' ''tender,'' ''exchange'' bespeak a world of social interaction, trust. In the meantime, informal terms like ''loot,'' ''lucre,'' and even today's ''cheddar'' (from government handouts of cheese) show our more problematic feelings about money. So far Bitcoin is spoken of in extreme terms, as a threat, or a bubble, or the empowerment of drug dealers. If it is taxed, and becomes normal, it may actually be more revolutionary. The poet Wallace Stevens called money ''a kind of poetry.'' He also had the horse sense to write his verses about the romance of the human imagination while walking to his job as a vice president for an insurance company. He knew both sides of the coin, when he said how closely the real and the imaginary need each other for society to work. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
No Bailout for Bitcoin Holders,"Imagine that the leading stockbroker in a country closed its doors without giving any reason. Its clients would be in a panic and customers of rival firms would be very nervous. That is exactly what has happened to Bitcoin, the leading pseudo-currency.  The website of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange in Tokyo disappeared from cyberspace on Tuesday morning, with no explanation provided. The exchange had previously admitted to problems with ""transaction malleability,"" a Bitcoin-world euphemism for susceptibility to hacking. Internet chat was intense. What looks like an internal memo from the company was circulating the web, stating that there had been thefts from accounts that Mt. Gox customers had assumed were perfectly safe. It is not clear whether the document is genuine. The price of Bitcoin on other exchanges dropped 8 percent, down 55 percent from last November's all-time high, according to bitcoinaverage.com. If Mt. Gox were an officially licensed broker, the government would be the first port of call. The relevant authorities would investigate and might even make good on some losses under a taxpayer- or industry-funded compensation scheme. Of course, if Mt. Gox had to meet government-mandated security standards, it might not have been allowed to operate without correcting a software vulnerability identified as far back as 2011. But Bitcoin's central appeal is that it is free from government interference. That is not quite true, since Bitcoin cannot make illegal activity legal. Bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem was an industry leader until his January indictment on charges  that he used the techno-currency to launder money. Still, the distance from the official world is great enough that Mt. Gox customers are almost totally on their own. The purported internal memo suggests that other Bitcoin fans might help out, so as to salvage the would-be financial asset's reputation. That's a thin reed to cling to. The expensive regulation and political backstops of conventional money are far from foolproof - look at the recently released Federal Reserve minutes from 2008 to see dysfunction in action. But the system is better than any known alternative, including one based on sophisticated software algorithms. Edward Hadas is economics editor at Reuters Breakingviews.

"Data Breaches Are Scary, but Don't Panic. React.","It's always upsetting when you are notified by a business, whether it is a credit card issuer or a retailer, that your personal or financial information may have been stolen in a data breach. The recent incident at Target stores, one of the largest corporate breaches in recent years, affected millions of people. ''We want people to react, but not panic,'' said Eva Velasquez, chief executive of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that provides free assistance to consumers.  After initially reporting that credit or debit card information from about 40 million shoppers was stolen from late November to mid-December in a hacking of Target's in-store network, the company said this month that systems housing personal data on 70 million customers (with some overlap with the first group) also had been compromised. Information on the second group, which includes people who may not have shopped at Target recently, included street addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. If you were in the group that received the first notification, you may already have been contacted by your bank and received a new debit card. JPMorgan Chase replaced about two million debit cards as a result of the breach, which also involved the theft of encrypted PINs; Citibank said it would reissue all debit cards involved in the breach as well. Neither bank is broadly reissuing credit cards, although they will do so upon request. Security consultants recommend that you monitor your financial accounts closely, preferably online, rather than waiting for periodic statements, and notify your bank of any suspicious charges. What if you received the second notification, which involves personal information rather than financial data? This data, while ''personally identifiable,'' is less sensitive than, say, your Social Security number, which could potentially be used to open new accounts in your name, said Ms. Velasquez. Still, it can help thieves target ''phishing'' attacks, in which you get emails that appear to be from a legitimate source, but which are really attempts to get you to divulge additional financial information. Closing an affected email account may be overkill, but ''I would definitely change my email password,'' said Ms. Velasquez, since you are supposed to change passwords periodically, anyway. While it's often easier to remember the same password for multiple websites, you should choose unique passwords for your bank account, she advised. ''Don't use the same password and PIN all over the place.'' She also advises that if you get an email or a phone call alerting you to a data breach, don't assume that the notification is legitimate and don't use any contact information provided without verifying it first. Rather, search online for the company's public phone number and call it yourself to confirm the notification is real. It also cannot hurt, she said, to take Target up on its offer of a year of free credit monitoring, which can help alert you to suspicious activity by tracking inquiries about your credit report. But John Ulzheimer, a consumer credit authority with Credit Sesame, said he considered the credit monitoring that Target was offering to be ''woefully inadequate'' because it covered only one of the three major credit bureaus. A more proactive step is to put a ''freeze'' on your credit reports, which restricts access to your credit file and prevents the unauthorized opening of new accounts. You'll have to remember to ''thaw'' the file, however, using a special code provided by the bureaus if you want to apply for credit. Here are some other questions to consider, to help keep your information safe: â- â[#x20ac][0/00]How often should I check my financial accounts? Bill Kowalski, director of operations for Rehmann Corporate Investigative Services, recommends checking your bank account online weekly at a minimum and preferably daily. Many people are online regularly to check email or social media sites, so it doesn't take much more time, he said. If that seems unreasonable, Alphonse Pascual, senior security analyst at Javelin Strategy & Research, suggests taking advantage of automatic alerts that most banks offer to help flag possibly suspicious activity by sending texts or emails â- â[#x20ac][0/00]What if I used a debit card at Target during the holiday season, but my bank hasn't replaced it? Some big banks, including Bank of America, are closely monitoring accounts and replacing cards considered at risk, rather than reissuing them in a blanket fashion. But the bank will give you a new debit or credit card upon request, said Betty Riess, a spokeswoman. At the very least, you should contact your bank to change your debit card's PIN. Target has said stolen PINs are not at risk because they were encrypted and the ''key'' to unlock the code is not stored on its systems. Still, ''It would be a prudent thing to do to change the PIN,'' said Mr. Pascual. ''It's easy to do and can give you extra peace of mind.'' â- â[#x20ac][0/00] Is it safer to use a credit card or a debit card when shopping? You may prefer debit cards to credit cards for routine purchases to avoid the temptation of running up debt. But credit cards generally offer stronger consumer fraud protections; in most cases, the most you will be liable for is $50. With debit cards, you could potentially be liable for up to $500, or even the full amount of the fraud, if you delay too long in reporting it to your bank. And you could face delays before you get your cash back. ''We recommend you use a credit card,'' said Ms. Velasquez. "
Solar Company Seeks Stiff U.S. Tariffs to Deter Chinese Spying,"In the daunting battle against corporate online espionage worldwide, one major solar company wants to deploy a powerful and novel weapon: higher tariffs. SolarWorld Americas, the largest manufacturer of solar panels in the United States, has asked the Commerce Department to investigate claims that Chinese military personnel broke into the company's computers and stole documents important to its business and its long-running trade dispute with China. The company's request followed the Justice Department's decision to prosecute five members of the People's Liberation Army, accusing them in May of stealing online files from a group of American companies, most of which had engaged in trade disputes with China. SolarWorld says the new prosecution underscores the sophisticated ways that Chinese companies are retaliating against trade obstacles, especially the use of cyberwarfare.  As a deterrent, the company is proposing that the administration should use tariffs to crack down on such retribution. ''We think it is critically important that the Commerce Department set a precedent here and take a strong stand that it will not tolerate cyberhacking of U.S. companies that file trade cases,'' said Timothy C. Brightbill, a lawyer representing SolarWorld. While acknowledging that the Justice Department is unlikely to compel the suspects to appear in a United States courtroom, he said the federal government could impose additional steep tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. ''This is a way that the U.S. could actually make it hurt,'' Mr. Brightbill said. A broader investigation by the Commerce Department into the costs of solar panels divided the industry from its start. Domestic solar farm developers and installers of solar systems, whose businesses had benefited from an abundance of cheap imported equipment, worried that the passed-on costs of tariffs would slow solar adoption among consumers. And American companies exporting polysilicon, the main raw material for solar products, to China feared that tariffs would make it harder for them to do business there. Indeed, China imposed steep duties on American polysilicon at the beginning of this year and recently tightened import policies on the material. Still, many executives and officials have been frustrated in trying to hold Chinese companies accountable for what they see as unfair or unscrupulous business practices. A federal judge recently found a state-controlled Chinese drywall manufacturer, Taishan Gypsum Company, in criminal and civil contempt after it abruptly abandoned court proceedings five years into a case that found it liable for contaminated drywall used in the homes of seven Virginia families. Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said he believed the implications of the case went far beyond drywall. ''It poses a defining moment for the Chinese government and its companies, which raises grave questions as to the risk of doing business with the Chinese,'' Senator Nelson said in July on the Senate floor. ''Will the Chinese government and its companies honor their moral and legal obligations under this or any other commercial contract?'' In the case of online crime, corporations across many industries are frequently reluctant to cooperate with prosecutions, said Shawn Henry, president of CrowdStrike Services, a security technology and services company, and a former executive assistant director of the F.B.I. They worry that publicizing security breaches risks their reputation and erodes competitive advantages, as well as opening the door to lawsuits. The threat of trade sanctions, Mr. Henry said, could offer the government a rare way to thwart hacking schemes before they happen. ''The value to the Chinese government and the companies that are benefiting from these thefts of intellectual property is in the billions of dollars, and the penalties or the risk is almost zero,'' he said. ''There aren't any mechanisms to hold anyone accountable.'' It is not clear how or if the Commerce Department will proceed; officials there declined to comment beyond saying that they were reviewing the request. Also uncertain is whether the White House, which is struggling to balance promoting the spread of green energy and protecting domestic manufacturing, would support the use of tariffs in such cases. A Justice Department spokesman, Marc Raimondi, said that the administration ''embraces an all-tools approach to these types of crimes.'' ''It's not just a criminal justice solution,'' Mr. Raimondi said. ''There are a number of different tools that can be used to target this type of criminal activity.'' Trade officials would first have to open an inquiry into how SolarWorld had been harmed and how the Chinese-owned solar companies -- unnamed in the Justice Department indictment -- had benefited, in order to impose additional duties on imports from those companies. If the Chinese government or companies decline to respond to information requests, the department can use other facts, including those presented by the other side in making a determination, trade lawyers said. Even if the Commerce Department does not open an investigation, trade experts say, the SolarWorld request and the Justice Department indictment are bringing needed attention to a government that is more aggressive than others have been in trying to promote its industries. ''The Chinese have taken their efforts on behalf of their economy -- and a lot of them are state-owned enterprises, a lot of them are state-supported -- to a level that I think most people within the trade area haven't seen,'' said Paul C. Rosenthal, a lawyer at Kelley Drye in Washington. ''It needs to be addressed, and there need to be better remedies available to address it.'' SolarWorld Americas, the Oregon-based subsidiary of a German company, originally brought its trade case in 2011 as a flood of cheap solar panels from China was pushing several domestic manufacturers to the edge of bankruptcy and beyond. After the Commerce Department found that the Chinese companies had benefited from unfair subsidies from their government and were selling equipment below the cost of manufacture, it began imposing stiff tariffs on Chinese imports in May 2012. According to the Justice Department, that is when a Chinese soldier sometimes known online as WinXYHappy and at least one co-conspirator began a series of break-ins into SolarWorld's computers to steal emails and attachments. Those included cash-flow records indicating SolarWorld's ability to survive financial strain, detailed information on proprietary technology and production costs and methods, as well as strategic discussions about the trade case with its lawyers. But even though the duties cut into China's solar business, that first Commerce Department decision applied only to panels made from Chinese solar cells, the final major parts that are assembled into finished modules. Many companies were able to avoid the duties by assembling panels from cells produced elsewhere, especially in Taiwan, so last year SolarWorld brought a new case to close the loophole. Preliminary decisions have gone in the company's favor, and the United States started collecting amended tariffs on imports ranging from roughly 19 to 55 percent this summer. The trade case is not yet final, but the new tariffs have begun reshaping the solar panel industry, helping SolarWorld and other manufacturers based outside China while also raising prices of equipment. But trade relations between the two countries have frayed even further. Foreign companies trying to do business in China have been facing new challenges as regulators and local government officials -- apparently eager to impress the Communist Party leadership -- appear to be aggressively enforcing the country's antimonopoly law. The Chinese foreign and defense ministries have denied any wrongdoing and have accused the United States of cybertheft and spying activities of its own, pointing to revelations from Edward J. Snowden about National Security Agency activities around the world. ''The problem for the United States is that it's trying to promote this norm against industrial espionage -- cybertheft of intellectual property -- as distinct from traditional political or military espionage,'' said Adam Segal, a senior fellow for China studies and director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''It's not an argument that many people bought even before Snowden, and now it's even harder to make.'' Some analysts say that the issues facing the two countries require a political and economic, rather than legal, solution and are calling for a settlement between governments. China recently asked for a suspension of the tariffs along with talks toward an agreement, but that has not yet moved forward. ''Everyone's just going back and forth, tit-for-tat, on this,'' said Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Center for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University. ''There needs to be some type of negotiation amongst all the parties and basically have a truce in the legal war and figure out what are the new rules of the game.'' "
My Bitcoin Befuddlement,"AM I the only person in the world who doesn't have Bitcoin jangling in a cryptographic wallet? Sometimes it seems that way. This famous experiment in virtual cash, with its aura of near anonymity and lack of pesky regulation, gets tech heads really excited. Yet it may be the most famous thing in the world that nobody really understands. People who hear about it have questions like ''What is it?'' and ''Wait, I still don't understand. What is it?'' and ''Why has the price fluctuated so wildly?'' And, finally, ''Are any of them, maybe, lodged between my sofa cushions?'' I can answer only the last question: No, unless you also have a virtual sofa.  I was born too late for the tulip bulbs and too early for Beanie Babies, but I don't want to miss out on Bitcoin mania. Of course, I can't become a Bitcoin mogul without knowing anything about it, so I did some research. The first thing I found out? This is the closest thing in finance to riding an angry bull at the rodeo. The value of a single Bitcoin has gone as high as $1,200 and plummeted on bad news for the currency, like theft through hacking, to less than half of that. So caveat investor, says the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra. Those spoilsports put out an alert warning investors that it could be ''more than a bit risky'' to buy and sell Bitcoin because of all that volatility, and that there was a potential for fraud in dealing with some of the companies that say they are involved in the Bitcoin world. Bracing! Wouldn't you know it? The bureaucrats are circling. The Internal Revenue Service has been looking at Bitcoin too, and with something of a gimlet eye. It recently tried to get a fix on just what Bitcoin is, because commerce is the sort of thing that the I.R.S. likes to get a piece of. On March 25, the friendly fellas at the tax office took a stab at telling us what Bitcoin, and other virtual currency, is. The answer, roughly, is that it's more like property than currency -- and, by the way, you do need to pay taxes on your Bitcoin transactions. Does that sound like paperwork and trouble? Well, you might say that, and news of the potentially burdensome ruling drove the cost of a Bitcoin to below $500. But many people took the news as a move forward for the legitimacy of the currency, or investment, or whatever the heck it is. To be fair, something whose value bobs and weaves this way does sound more like an investment than a currency. In fact, it sounds like many investments I've made in my proven track record of buying high and selling low. It's a gift. Folks like Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, applauded the I.R.S. move, saying it ''provides clarity for taxpayers who want to ensure that they're doing the right thing and playing by the rules when utilizing Bitcoin and other digital currencies.'' I'M still no expert, but isn't playing by the rules the opposite of what many people who are interested in Bitcoin want -- and, more important, what I want? Don't I get to fly my pirate flag? If I wanted to play by the rules, wouldn't I just invest in a money-market fund, with perfect safety and ... sorry, I just fell asleep for a moment. But that dream state reminds me: As a science-fiction fan, I used to tear through books that predicted a digital-currency future, an anonymous underground economy where value flowed without government buttinskis. It made money seem exciting, not just depressing. And the novels predicted that government, threatened by the crypto-cash revolt, would do anything it could to block that future. Of course, who needs government sabotage when the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange, already seems to be doing a fine job of undermining faith in digital currency? It has out-Finra'd Finra! I called a smart person to help me figure all this out. Ajay Vinze, associate dean at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, has done research on Bitcoin, and he says that if you are going to disrupt the existing way of doing things, ''you come across as a pirate.'' He told me that Bitcoin wasn't yet functioning quite like money because of all the volatility, but that it's well on its way to the kind of respectability that requires a less swashbuckling demeanor. ''Once you're successful,'' he said, ''you're stuck with this nuance of having to put on the cloak of legitimacy.'' As my brain started to melt, I realized that some of the smartest people in the business world completely disagree about Bitcoin. It's caused something of a billionaire slap fight between Warren Buffett and Marc Andreessen. Mr. Buffett recently expressed skepticism about the new currency. ''It's a mirage, basically,'' he told CNBC on March 14. He added, ''The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke, in my view.'' Mr. Andreessen, who invented the first popular web browser and became a big tech investor, made it sound as if the Oracle of Omaha had told the whole Internet to get off his lawn. As a champion of new technologies, Mr. Andreessen has ranked Bitcoin's importance up with that of personal computers and the Internet. His venture capital firm has invested more than $50 million in Bitcoin-related companies. In a Twitter post, he called Mr. Buffett one of the ''old white men'' who disparage technologies they don't understand. Mr. Andreessen, as it turns out, is also white and also not so young anymore, at least not by wunderkind standards. He backpedaled a bit with a succession of tweets praising Mr. Buffett highly, and offered to spend ''as much time with Warren as he wants teaching him all about Bitcoin. :-)'' Mr. Buffett didn't respond publicly to Mr. Andreessen, or to my request for comment, because he's Warren Buffett, for crying out loud, and he doesn't need to mess with this kind of stuff. O.K., two observations here: First, does Mr. Buffett really want to spend a lot of time getting a tutorial from Mr. Andreessen? You can just read the frequently asked questions list at Bitcoin.org, though it's full of language like ''the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms.'' Sorry, I dropped off again ... But what bothers me is this: When billionaires fight, shouldn't it be with weaponry more impressive than tweets? Twitter is the battleground for weenies. Billionaires have the money to buy private armies! Of robot warriors! With lasers! On a giant chessboard! That's the true spirit of virtual currency, isn't it? Real life is such a disappointment. I'M hoping for the Bitcoin world to be more fun. So far, though, finding someone who accepts virtual currency isn't that easy. The site useBitcoins.info lists more than 2,000 businesses that take the currency, or investment, or whatever, all over the world. If I need an electrician in Coventry, England, I'm covered, and I can use Bitcoin to satisfy all of my beef jerky needs at beefjerky.com. Yet trying to handle transactions in my New Jersey neighborhood is a little tougher. I've been asking around. There's apparently a fitness ''boot camp'' in the town next door that accepts Bitcoin, but I don't like paying people to sweat when I can sweat just fine for nothing. At my local car-rental counter, the guys look at me as if I were trying to pull a fast one. The checkout machine at Home Depot doesn't have a button for paying with Bitcoin. And my cats act as if they don't know what I'm talking about. I guess they aren't living in the future. "
Why Bitcoin Matters," Editor's note: Marc Andreessen's venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has invested just under $50 million in Bitcoin-related start-ups. The firm is actively searching for more Bitcoin-based investment opportunities. He does not personally own more than a de minimis amount of Bitcoin.  A mysterious new technology emerges, seemingly out of nowhere, but actually the result of two decades of intense research and development by nearly anonymous researchers. Political idealists project visions of liberation and revolution onto it; establishment elites heap contempt and scorn on it.  On the other hand, technologists - nerds - are transfixed by it. They see within it enormous potential and spend their nights and weekends tinkering with it. Eventually mainstream products, companies and industries emerge to commercialize it; its effects become profound; and later, many people wonder why its powerful promise wasn't more obvious from the start. What technology am I talking about? Personal computers in 1975, the Internet in 1993, and - I believe - Bitcoin in 2014. One can hardly accuse Bitcoin of being an uncovered topic, yet the gulf between what the press and many regular people believe Bitcoin is, and what a growing critical mass of technologists believe Bitcoin is, remains enormous. In this post, I will explain why Bitcoin has so many Silicon Valley programmers and entrepreneurs all lathered up, and what I think Bitcoin's future potential is. First, Bitcoin at its most fundamental level is a breakthrough in computer science - one that builds on 20 years of research into cryptographic currency, and 40 years of research in cryptography, by thousands of researchers around the world. Bitcoin is the first practical solution to a longstanding problem in computer science called the Byzantine Generals Problem. To quote from the original paper defining the B.G.P.: ""[Imagine] a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement.""   More generally, the B.G.P. poses the question of how to establish trust between otherwise unrelated parties over an untrusted network like the Internet. The practical consequence of solving this problem is that Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate. What kinds of digital property might be transferred in this way? Think about digital signatures, digital contracts, digital keys (to physical locks, or to online lockers), digital ownership of physical assets such as cars and houses, digital stocks and bonds ... and digital money. All these are exchanged through a distributed network of trust that does not require or rely upon a central intermediary like a bank or broker. And all in a way where only the owner of an asset can send it, only the intended recipient can receive it, the asset can only exist in one place at a time, and everyone can validate transactions and ownership of all assets anytime they want. How does this work? Bitcoin is an Internet-wide distributed ledger. You buy into the ledger by purchasing one of a fixed number of slots, either with cash or by selling a product and service for Bitcoin. You sell out of the ledger by trading your Bitcoin to someone else who wants to buy into the ledger. Anyone in the world can buy into or sell out of the ledger any time they want - with no approval needed, and with no or very low fees. The Bitcoin ""coins"" themselves are simply slots in the ledger, analogous in some ways to seats on a stock exchange, except much more broadly applicable to real world transactions. The Bitcoin ledger is a new kind of payment system. Anyone in the world can pay anyone else in the world any amount of value of Bitcoin by simply transferring ownership of the corresponding slot in the ledger. Put value in, transfer it, the recipient gets value out, no authorization required, and in many cases, no fees. That last part is enormously important. Bitcoin is the first Internetwide payment system where transactions either happen with no fees or very low fees (down to fractions of pennies). Existing payment systems charge fees of about 2 to 3 percent - and that's in the developed world. In lots of other places, there either are no modern payment systems or the rates are significantly higher. We'll come back to that. Bitcoin is a digital bearer instrument. It is a way to exchange money or assets between parties with no pre-existing trust: A string of numbers is sent over email or text message in the simplest case. The sender doesn't need to know or trust the receiver or vice versa. Related, there are no chargebacks - this is the part that is literally like cash - if you have the money or the asset, you can pay with it; if you don't, you can't. This is brand new. This has never existed in digital form before. Bitcoin is a digital currency, whose value is based directly on two things: use of the payment system today - volume and velocity of payments running through the ledger - and speculation on future use of the payment system. This is one part that is confusing people. It's not as much that the Bitcoin currency has some arbitrary value and then people are trading with it; it's more that people can trade with Bitcoin (anywhere, everywhere, with no fraud and no or very low fees) and as a result it has value. It is perhaps true right at this moment that the value of Bitcoin currency is based more on speculation than actual payment volume, but it is equally true that that speculation is establishing a sufficiently high price for the currency that payments have become practically possible. The Bitcoin currency had to be worth something before it could bear any amount of real-world payment volume. This is the classic ""chicken and egg"" problem with new technology: new technology is not worth much until it's worth a lot. And so the fact that Bitcoin has risen in value in part because of speculation is making the reality of its usefulness arrive much faster than it would have otherwise. Critics of Bitcoin point to limited usage by ordinary consumers and merchants, but that same criticism was leveled against PCs and the Internet at the same stage. Every day, more and more consumers and merchants are buying, using and selling Bitcoin, all around the world. The overall numbers are still small, but they are growing quickly. And ease of use for all participants is rapidly increasing as Bitcoin tools and technologies are improved. Remember, it used to be technically challenging to even get on the Internet. Now it's not. The criticism that merchants will not accept Bitcoin because of its volatility is also incorrect. Bitcoin can be used entirely as a payment system; merchants do not need to hold any Bitcoin currency or be exposed to Bitcoin volatility at any time. Any consumer or merchant can trade in and out of Bitcoin and other currencies any time they want. Why would any merchant - online or in the real world - want to accept Bitcoin as payment, given the currently small number of consumers who want to pay with it? My partner Chris Dixon recently gave this example: ""Let's say you sell electronics online. Profit margins in those businesses are usually under 5 percent, which means conventional 2.5 percent payment fees consume half the margin. That's money that could be reinvested in the business, passed back to consumers or taxed by the government. Of all of those choices, handing 2.5 percent to banks to move bits around the Internet is the worst possible choice. Another challenge merchants have with payments is accepting international payments. If you are wondering why your favorite product or service isn't available in your country, the answer is often payments."" In addition, merchants are highly attracted to Bitcoin because it eliminates the risk of credit card fraud. This is the form of fraud that motivates so many criminals to put so much work into stealing personal customer information and credit card numbers. Since Bitcoin is a digital bearer instrument, the receiver of a payment does not get any information from the sender that can be used to steal money from the sender in the future, either by that merchant or by a criminal who steals that information from the merchant. Credit card fraud is such a big deal for merchants, credit card processors and banks that online fraud detection systems are hair-trigger wired to stop transactions that look even slightly suspicious, whether or not they are actually fraudulent. As a result, many online merchants are forced to turn away 5 to 10 percent of incoming orders that they could take without fear if the customers were paying with Bitcoin, where such fraud would not be possible. Since these are orders that were coming in already, they are inherently the highest margin orders a merchant can get, and so being able to take them will drastically increase many merchants' profit margins. Bitcoin's antifraud properties even extend into the physical world of retail stores and shoppers. For example, with Bitcoin, the huge hack that recently stole 70 million consumers' credit card information from the Target department store chain would not have been possible. Here's how that would work: You fill your cart and go to the checkout station like you do now. But instead of handing over your credit card to pay, you pull out your smartphone and take a snapshot of a QR code displayed by the cash register. The QR code contains all the information required for you to send Bitcoin to Target, including the amount. You click ""Confirm"" on your phone and the transaction is done (including converting dollars from your account into Bitcoin, if you did not own any Bitcoin). Target is happy because it has the money in the form of Bitcoin, which it can immediately turn into dollars if it wants, and it paid no or very low payment processing fees; you are happy because there is no way for hackers to steal any of your personal information; and organized crime is unhappy. (Well, maybe criminals are still happy: They can try to steal money directly from poorly-secured merchant computer systems. But even if they succeed, consumers bear no risk of loss, fraud or identity theft.) Finally, I'd like to address the claim made by some critics that Bitcoin is a haven for bad behavior, for criminals and terrorists to transfer money anonymously with impunity. This is a myth, fostered mostly by sensationalistic press coverage and an incomplete understanding of the technology. Much like email, which is quite traceable, Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous. Further, every transaction in the Bitcoin network is tracked and logged forever in the Bitcoin blockchain, or permanent record, available for all to see. As a result, Bitcoin is considerably easier for law enforcement to trace than cash, gold or diamonds. What's the future of Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a classic network effect, a positive feedback loop. The more people who use Bitcoin, the more valuable Bitcoin is for everyone who uses it, and the higher the incentive for the next user to start using the technology. Bitcoin shares this network effect property with the telephone system, the web, and popular Internet services like eBay and Facebook. In fact, Bitcoin is a four-sided network effect. There are four constituencies that participate in expanding the value of Bitcoin as a consequence of their own self-interested participation. Those constituencies are (1) consumers who pay with Bitcoin, (2) merchants who accept Bitcoin, (3) ""miners"" who run the computers that process and validate all the transactions and enable the distributed trust network to exist, and (4) developers and entrepreneurs who are building new products and services with and on top of Bitcoin. All four sides of the network effect are playing a valuable part in expanding the value of the overall system, but the fourth is particularly important. All over Silicon Valley and around the world, many thousands of programmers are using Bitcoin as a building block for a kaleidoscope of new product and service ideas that were not possible before. And at our venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, we are seeing a rapidly increasing number of outstanding entrepreneurs - not a few with highly respected track records in the financial industry - building companies on top of Bitcoin. For this reason alone, new challengers to Bitcoin face a hard uphill battle. If something is to displace Bitcoin now, it will have to have sizable improvements and it will have to happen quickly. Otherwise, this network effect will carry Bitcoin to dominance. One immediately obvious and enormous area for Bitcoin-based innovation is international remittance. Every day, hundreds of millions of low-income people go to work in hard jobs in foreign countries to make money to send back to their families in their home countries - over $400 billion in total annually, according to the World Bank. Every day, banks and payment companies extract mind-boggling fees, up to 10 percent and sometimes even higher, to send this money. Switching to Bitcoin, which charges no or very low fees, for these remittance payments will therefore raise the quality of life of migrant workers and their families significantly. In fact, it is hard to think of any one thing that would have a faster and more positive effect on so many people in the world's poorest countries. Moreover, Bitcoin generally can be a powerful force to bring a much larger number of people around the world into the modern economic system. Only about 20 countries around the world have what we would consider to be fully modern banking and payment systems; the other roughly 175 have a long way to go. As a result, many people in many countries are excluded from products and services that we in the West take for granted. Even Netflix, a completely virtual service, is only available in about 40 countries. Bitcoin, as a global payment system anyone can use from anywhere at any time, can be a powerful catalyst to extend the benefits of the modern economic system to virtually everyone on the planet. And even here in the United States, a long-recognized problem is the extremely high fees that the ""unbanked"" - people without conventional bank accounts - pay for even basic financial services. Bitcoin can be used to go straight at that problem, by making it easy to offer extremely low-fee services to people outside of the traditional financial system. A third fascinating use case for Bitcoin is micropayments, or ultrasmall payments. Micropayments have never been feasible, despite 20 years of attempts, because it is not cost effective to run small payments (think $1 and below, down to pennies or fractions of a penny) through the existing credit/debit and banking systems. The fee structure of those systems makes that nonviable. All of a sudden, with Bitcoin, that's trivially easy. Bitcoins have the nifty property of infinite divisibility: currently down to eight decimal places after the dot, but more in the future. So you can specify an arbitrarily small amount of money, like a thousandth of a penny, and send it to anyone in the world for free or near-free. Think about content monetization, for example. One reason media businesses such as newspapers struggle to charge for content is because they need to charge either all (pay the entire subscription fee for all the content) or nothing (which then results in all those terrible banner ads everywhere on the web). All of a sudden, with Bitcoin, there is an economically viable way to charge arbitrarily small amounts of money per article, or per section, or per hour, or per video play, or per archive access, or per news alert. Another potential use of Bitcoin micropayments is to fight spam. Future email systems and social networks could refuse to accept incoming messages unless they were accompanied with tiny amounts of Bitcoin - tiny enough to not matter to the sender, but large enough to deter spammers, who today can send uncounted billions of spam messages for free with impunity. Finally, a fourth interesting use case is public payments. This idea first came to my attention in a news article a few months ago. A random spectator at a televised sports event held up a placard with a QR code and the text ""Send me Bitcoin!"" He received $25,000 in Bitcoin in the first 24 hours, all from people he had never met. This was the first time in history that you could see someone holding up a sign, in person or on TV or in a photo, and then send them money with two clicks on your smartphone: take the photo of the QR code on the sign, and click to send the money. Think about the implications for protest movements. Today protesters want to get on TV so people learn about their cause. Tomorrow they'll want to get on TV because that's how they'll raise money, by literally holding up signs that let people anywhere in the world who sympathize with them send them money on the spot. Bitcoin is a financial technology dream come true for even the most hardened anticapitalist political organizer. The coming years will be a period of great drama and excitement revolving around this new technology. For example, some prominent economists are deeply skeptical of Bitcoin, even though Ben S. Bernanke, formerly Federal Reserve chairman, recently wrote that digital currencies like Bitcoin ""may hold long-term promise, particularly if they promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system."" And in 1999, the legendary economist Milton Friedman said: ""One thing that's missing but will soon be developed is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B without A knowing B or B knowing A - the way I can take a $20 bill and hand it over to you, and you may get that without knowing who I am.""   Economists who attack Bitcoin today might be correct, but I'm with Ben and Milton. Further, there is no shortage of regulatory topics and issues that will have to be addressed, since almost no country's regulatory framework for banking and payments anticipated a technology like Bitcoin. But I hope that I have given you a sense of the enormous promise of Bitcoin. Far from a mere libertarian fairy tale or a simple Silicon Valley exercise in hype, Bitcoin offers a sweeping vista of opportunity to reimagine how the financial system can and should work in the Internet era, and a catalyst to reshape that system in ways that are more powerful for individuals and businesses alike.

"Newsweek Unmasks Bitcoin Founder, Stirring Ire","An article in Newsweek that says it has found the real Satoshi Nakamoto, the alias used by the creator of the virtual currency Bitcoin, has prompted many enthusiasts to question whether the right person had been identified. According to the Newsweek article published online on Thursday, the real Satoshi Nakamoto is a 64-year-old model train buff living in Southern California with his mom. His birth name was, in fact, Satoshi Nakamoto, which had previously been thought to be a pseudonym for the creator, or group of creators, behind Bitcoin.  When approached by a reporter, Mr. Nakamoto said that he was ""no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it."" ""It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection,"" he is quoted as saying.  The origins of Bitcoin, a computer-driven form of money that only exists online, have been a mystery since it appeared in 2009. Other publications have tried, and failed, to identify the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Newsweek says it found Mr. Nakamoto by going through a database of naturalized American citizens. According to the article, Mr. Nakamoto was born in Japan, the spiritual birthplace of Bitcoin, and now goes by ""Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto."" Mr. Nakamoto appeared to have called the police when a Newsweek reporter came to his home, so great was his desire to not speak about the virtual currency. Various relatives quoted in the story also did not know, or did not say, whether he created Bitcoin. People have generally thought that Bitcoin was created by a group of programmers rather than an individual because of its complex mathematics and structure. The Newsweek article links Mr. Nakamoto to Bitcoin through various work experiences, but offers no hard evidence.   Many in the Bitcoin community said that Newsweek had made compelling arguments, but others were swift to wonder whether the right person had been identified. ""Computer security researchers, we're trained to be skeptical,"" said Tyler Moore, an assistant professor at Southern Methodist University who led a discussion of anonymity and Bitcoin at a cryptography conference on Thursday. ""Most of the people I've talked to have taken a 'wait and see' approach."" The article also caused a stir for offering various personal details about Mr. Nakamoto, including where he lives, his age and birthplace. Those details elicited a number of angry comments on Newsweek's website and elsewhere, and ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" was trending for part of the day on Thursday. The author of the Newsweek story, Leah McGrath Goodman, even took to her Twitter to answer some often heated questions from readers.  ""This man invented something that shaped our world. Should all inventors now fear murder?"" Ms. Goodman wrote in response to a comment about posting Mr. Nakamoto's personal details. Users access Bitcoins by solving math riddles with software programs, or buying the coins on online ""exchanges."" Only about 12.4 million coins are in circulation, and the original creator ensured that only 21 million coins would ever exist. But Bitcoin has failed to catch on with mainstream financial institutions. It is backed by no central bank and fluctuates wildly in price. Some users like the fact that Bitcoin circumvents the traditional banking system, but they are also left with few options when things go south. Last week, the virtual currency world was shaken by the collapse of Mt. Gox, which at one point handled about 80 percent of all Bitcoin transactions.  "
Can You Trust 'Secure' Messaging Apps?," It's officially a post-Snowden and post-WhatsApp world, and my inbox is filled with pitches from companies promoting their secure messaging apps. But can you trust them?  As the messaging wars heat up, security seems to be the big differentiator -the levels of security range from ""military grade"" to lightweight, depending on the app. But all of them have one thing in common, said the cryptographer and security expert Bruce Schneier: You shouldn't use them if your life is on the line.  Mr. Schneier said when it comes to evaluating the security of a secure messaging app, the real question lies in why you need it.   ""Secure means what?"" he said. ""If I say my house is secure, it's not secure against bombs. Most people's threat model are their friends in high school. If they're Chinese dissidents trying to stay alive, I wouldn't trust it. But if there's a high school kid trying to navigate the bullies, it's probably good enough.""  As you determine your threat model, know that some secure apps promise much more than others.  On the heavyweight side are apps like TextSecure, which I wrote about in February as a text messaging substitute. TextSecure recently relaunched as a private messaging app that sidesteps SMS (Short Message Service) completely, WhatsApp-style, with encryption built in by default.  There's Gliph, a communications app that includes encrypted messaging and email services and private web chat, and that further differentiates itself with Bitcoin wallet features built in.  And Telegram is a hugely popular Russian messaging app whose creators were so confident in its ability to secure your messages that they offered a $200,000 bug bounty to anyone who could decrypt its intercepted traffic. In the first contest, which ended March 1, no one managed to crack the encryption.  Wickr has been around for a while, and boasts not only of ""military grade"" message encryption of text, pictures and video, but also the ability to control how long a recipient can view a message before it's deleted.  There's Heml.is, currently in development, whose site complains that ""private communication has more or less turned into an open stream for companies and governments to listen into."" Redact says it ""sends heavily encrypted messages from one phone to another without passing through any central servers."" And then there are ephemeral messaging services - light on things like encryption, but promising that your messages will disappear before they can be used against you. Snapchat kicked it off for photos, of course, but now there's also Confide, Frankly, Ansa and the new Mark Cuban venture, CyberDust.  Cuban said CyberDust (and presumably other ephemeral messengers) isn't about trying to shield communications with the National Security Agency - it's about controlling your own messaging so something you say can't be used against you permanently in the future.  ""It's pretty stupid to text knowing that we lose control of the text once we hit send,"" Mr. Cuban said. ""Even the most innocent text loses its context and can be misunderstood over time.""  But Mr. Schneier said no matter the level of security promised, ""what does secure mean?""  Ephemeral app services, he said, supposedly delete messages after they're sent. ""Well, is it true? We know that Snapchat was under investigation because they claimed they deleted messages and it turned out they hadn't.""  ""Let's say they're encrypted,"" he said. ""That means that, assuming they did a decent job, no one can read the messages in transit. It doesn't mean they can't read them on your computer, and it doesn't mean that someone can't issue a court order to get those messages off a server somewhere.""  Worse, he said, a government (like ours) could secretly issue a court order forcing a messaging app to circumvent its own encryption, as happened with the secure email service Lavabit, or even ordering an ephemeral messaging app to keep messages it said it had deleted.  ""What are these companies promising?"" Mr. Schneier asked. ""They're not saying that they're going to defy a court order, that they're going to go to jail to protect your messages.""  Mr. Schneier said he relies on ""any chat service"" for casual communications and good old-fashioned OTR (off the record) and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) for private communications. But he said that for most people, secure messaging apps of any stripe are probably sufficiently secure.  ""We lock our front doors even though we know someone can break the window - it's good enough,"" he said. ""We know our burglar alarm companies won't protect us against military invasion.""   "
Appeals Court Overturns Conviction of AT&T Hacker Known as 'Weev',"A federal appeals court on Friday reversed the conviction of Andrew ""Weev"" Auernheimer, a hacker and self-described Internet troll, who was accused of stealing the personal data of 114,000 Apple iPad users in 2010.  At the time, Mr. Auernheimer and Daniel Spitler, operating as part of a group called Goatse Security, gained national attention when they discovered a security loophole on AT&T's website that allowed them to gain access to the addresses of the carrier's customers and their corresponding iPad identification numbers. Mr. Auernheimer was sentenced to 41 months in prison for the breach. Mr. Spitler, who pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computers and one count of identity theft, received probation. In its decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said that the conviction of Mr. Auernheimer by a jury in Newark, N.J., and the subsequent prison sentence could not stand because the case did not belong in that state. Prosecutors had argued at the time that the case should be tried in New Jersey because AT&T's servers were housed there. But an appeals court judge, writing in the unanimous three-person opinion on Friday, noted that evidence at Mr. Auernheimer's trial showed that the servers that had been entered were in Texas and Georgia. ""Although this appeal raises a number of complex and novel issues that are of great public importance in our increasingly interconnected age, we find it necessary to reach only one that has been fundamental since our country's founding: venue,"" Judge Michael A. Chagares wrote. ""As discussed, neither Auernheimer nor Spitler accessed a computer in New Jersey."" Judge Chagares said Mr. Auernheimer had been denied his ""substantial right to be tried in the place where his alleged crime was committed."" The case became publicized in 2010 and 2011 for the high-profile nature of the intrusions. Stolen email addresses included those of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and employees of the Justice Department, NASA and the Department of Homeland Security. There were also a number of celebrities on the list, and the information was passed along to the gossip blog Gawker. In court, Mr. Spitler told prosecutors that he had tried to notify AT&T about the security hole on the company's website, but the company did not respond. He said he had not sold the emails or posted them online.  "
"Inside North Korea, a Reporter's Journey"," David E. Sanger is the national security correspondent for The Times.   Twenty-two years ago, as The Times's bureau chief in Japan,I joined a rare trip to North Korea. The ostensible purpose was to travel by train up to the Tumen River, which China, Russia and North Korea all meet. Our traveling companions were, again ostensibly, Japanese and South Korean business executives interested in investing in a long-abandoned port that the United Nations was exploring as a way to reintegrate the Hermit Kingdom with its neighbors.  In fact, the business executives were mostly retired, returning to see a North Korea they remembered from Japan's occupation of the country, or before the hard partition of the country created by the end of the Korean War. The Western journalists were along to fill out the trip, presumably because we were the only ones crazy enough to spend $5,000 for a tour to a corner of the country most people hadn't seen for a generation. (That princely sum bought us hard bunks in a tiny train car, patriotic music blaring all night and a bathroom that consisted of a hole in the floor through which one could see the tracks below.) The train moved painfully slowly, because the track was in such disrepair.  As we passed yet another abandoned factory and denuded hillside - the trees had been burned for firewood in the winter - I turned to one of my traveling companions, Colin Nickerson of The Boston Globe, and confidently predicted that the country would collapse in three years.  I was wrong. Writing about North Korea - especially about the intelligence concerning its nuclear program, its leadership struggles and in recent weeks its cyberwarfare program - is a repeated exercise in reportorial humility. It doesn't make sense that the country still exists: When I decamped from Asia 20 years ago to move to Washington, the South Koreans, who should know their neighbors best, were busy holding emergency meetings about how to handle the imminent implosion or explosion of the country, where the mantle of leadership had just passed to a new, untested leader. Every time I return to Seoul, it seems as if the same meeting is still underway. And the country continues to surprise. No rational person looking at the nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran would have put money on the fine graduates of Kim Il-sung University getting the Bomb years ahead of the Tehran's savvy, Western-educated engineers. Yet that's what happened. Nor does it make sense that a country lacking enough Internet connections to satisfy the broadband needs of a small town of American teenagers would figure out how to raid, terrorize and shut down Sony Pictures. Yet if President Obama's direct accusation proves accurate, that's what happened. All of which raises the question: How do you cover a cyberconflict involving attacks you cannot see launched, supposedly, by a country you cannot learn much about? Again, a little humility about what we don't know is key here. For years I've been trying to immerse myself in the shadowy world of American intelligence officials, cyberwarriors and Internet security experts to help explain how computer conflict is changing the way nations compete with each other. But even with the revelations of Edward J. Snowden, this is the slowest, hardest form of reporting: The United States government doesn't want to talk about how it has penetrated foreign computer networks, and it really doesn't want to talk about its own growing arsenal of cyberweapons. So the stories take a long time to report: It took me 14 months to dig into the tale of how Presidents Bush and Obama expanded the attacks on Iran's largest nuclear enrichment facility. So it was no surprise that when North Korea's own Internet connections began to fail last week, government officials didn't want to talk about it - other than to muse how accidents can happen.  We have a lot of reporting work to do, on both North Korea and Sony. Explaining the evidence that the United States government appears so certain about will take a lot of digging through both the computer forensics - all malware leaves its own distinctive DNA - and the political and intelligence institutions of several nations. Explaining how North Korea has turned from a focus on nuclear weapons to one on cyberweapons is another tale - and another example of how hard it is to understand this country.  But it is a story worth pursuing, because Sony is the leading edge of something that's been building steam for a long time: the ability of failing states, angry states and nonstate actors to reach deep inside their adversaries, trigger havoc and make demands. It's something we couldn't have conceived North Korea being capable of doing during that train trip, when the country's bureaucrats had a hard time organizing a picnic for us on the beach. (In their defense, the beach was heavily mined, so volleyball games were out of the question.) Then again, it takes a lot of ingenuity these days to keep a country like North Korea alive - and we were reminded in the past few weeks that while the country's leaders may be Stalinist hermits, regime survival remains their greatest skill.

New Bug Found in Widely Used OpenSSL Encryption,"Security experts are still trying to plug the hole left by Heartbleed, the bug found in the widely used OpenSSL encryption protocol, with some 12,000 popular domains still vulnerable, according to AVG Virus Labs.  Now they have something else to worry about. On Thursday, the OpenSSL Foundation issued a warning to users that a decade-old bug that makes it possible for an attacker to conduct a so-called man-in-the-middle attack on traffic encrypted with OpenSSL. The advisory warns users that someone could use the bug to intercept an encrypted connection, decrypt it, and read the traffic. Users of OpenSSL are advised to deploy a new patch and upgrade to the latest version of OpenSSL software. The bug was initially discovered by Masashi Kikuchi, a Japanese researcher at Lepidum, a software firm. ""Attackers can eavesdrop and make falsifications on your communication when both of a server and a client are vulnerable,"" reads an FAQ on Lepidum's website. Unlike Heartbleed, which could be used to directly exploit any server using OpenSSL, this new bug requires that the attacker be located between two computers communicating. A likely target, for example, would be someone using an airport's public Wi-Fi. The new bug was introduced into OpenSSL when it was first released in 1998, more than 10 years before Heartbleed, which was first introduced in a code update on New Year's Eve in 2011. The fact that the new bug went undetected for so long is another black mark on the management of OpenSSL. The encryption method is open source, meaning it can be reviewed and updated by anyone. Because of that, it is considered more secure and more trustworthy than proprietary code vetted by just one company's engineers. But, in reality, OpenSSL had only one full-time developer and three ""core"" volunteer programmers in Europe, and operated on a budget of $2,000 in annual donations. This, despite the fact that OpenSSL is used to encrypt the majority of the world's web servers and widely used by technology companies such as Amazon and Cisco. Following the Heartbleed discovery, major companies, including Amazon, Cisco, Dell, Facebook, Fujitsu, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NetApp, Rackspace, Qualcomm and VMWare, each pledged $100,000 a year over the next three years to the Core Infrastructure Initiative, a new open source initiativeorganized by the Linux Foundation to support crucial open-source infrastructure, like OpenSSL.

When Tabloids Take the Low Road,"The stalking of individuals via unethical prying into their private affairs has long been part of the lure and shame of British tabloid journalism. At last, the tabloids' methodology has been upended by the criminal conviction in a phone-hacking scandal perpetrated in part by Andy Coulson -- a former premier editor in Rupert Murdoch's media empire who later ascended through the cozy world of London press barons and politicians to become a spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain.  Mr. Cameron was among the first to offer a public apology Tuesday for ever hiring Mr. Coulson, whose downfall riveted the nation and the world for two years as investigators laid bare habitual newsroom abuses -- from phone hacking to bribery of public officials to the tapping of confidential medical records -- at News of the World, the paper Mr. Murdoch was forced to close as the scandal mushroomed. Any notion that tabloids might at worst be merely resourceful in adapting modern technology to their endless quest for scoops was dashed when the public discovered that the paper had intercepted the messages of agonized relatives left on the cellphone of a missing teenager, Milly Dowler, who was later found dead. This wasn't the usual playful celebrity or royal family exposé unearthed via amusing dirty pool; this was the cruelest violation of privacy. It's important in measuring the scandal to note the key role played by another newspaper, The Guardian, in exposing the depth of tabloid abuses. The Guardian's thorough reporting is rebuttal enough to misguided proposals that Parliament enact watchdog measures that would compromise the press's ability to do its job in a free society. While Mr. Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to intercept voice-mail messages, the jury acquitted Rebekah Brooks, his predecessor as editor of News of the World, of all charges related to phone hacking, hiding evidence and bribing public officials. But other editors and reporters await trial, while five were convicted earlier, and the scandal is far from finished. Skepticism and unanswered questions remain about how and why Mr. Cameron turned to the Murdoch empire and chose Mr. Coulson as his voice to the public. "
Britain: Ex-Editor Faces Bribery Retrial,"LONDON -- Prosecutors said Monday that they would seek a retrial for Andy Coulson, a former spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron who once edited Rupert Murdoch's best-selling tabloid in Britain, on charges of illegally acquiring royal telephone directories from police officers.  A court in London was told of the plans by the prosecutor, Andrew Edis, after a jury failed to reach a verdict on bribery charges last week and found Mr. Coulson guilty of only one charge, a conspiracy to hack into mobile phones during his time at the helm of The News of the World, a Sunday paper that is now defunct. The paper's former royals editor, Clive Goodman, will also be retried on the same charges; Mr. Goodman has already pleaded guilty to a separate charge of phone hacking that occurred in 2006. Mr. Coulson, who resigned from Mr. Cameron's office in 2011, faces up to two years in prison for the hacking verdict. The judge is expected to sentence him on Friday, along with three other former colleagues at The News of the World, who pleaded guilty before the trial. A fourth colleague who has admitted to phone hacking will be sentenced in late July. Prosecutors have argued that as deputy editor from 2000 to 2003 and then as editor from 2003 to 2007, Mr. Coulson condoned phone hacking on a ''systemic'' scale. They allege that he condoned the paying of bribes for the royal phone books, and then used them to intercept the voice mail messages of aides to the royal family. The police say thousands of phones were targeted. On Monday, Mr. Edis described the list of phone hacking victims as ''a Who's Who to Britain for the first five years of the century,'' noting that ''what occurred was the routine invasion of privacy and that has the capacity to do serious harm.'' After Mr. Coulson's conviction last week, Mr. Cameron publicly apologized for hiring him and called it ''the wrong decision.'' The News of the World was closed by Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper holding company, News International, now renamed News UK, in July 2011 after it emerged that a private investigator employed by the tabloid had intercepted voice mail messages left on the mobile phone of a kidnapped teenager in 2002 who was later found dead. Rebekah Brooks, who was Mr. Coulson's boss between 2000 and 2003, was acquitted of all charges last week. "
"If You're the Victim of a Tax Fraud, Tell the I.R.S.","Victim of Tax Fraud? Tell the I.R.S. Q. I got an aggressive telephone call from someone claiming to be from the Internal Revenue Service, saying I owed money. I was suspicious and hung up. If this is a fraud, is there a place to report it? A. Since last fall, the Internal Revenue Service has been warning of a persistent telephone fraud, but the swindle has increased in intensity during the tax season. The caller may use fake I.R.S. badge numbers, spoof the agency's number on the phone's caller ID, know part of the victim's Social Security number or send fraudulent emails in conjunction with the calls. Victims may even receive additional calls purporting to be from law enforcement or other agencies in an attempt to make the ruse seem legitimate.  The I.R.S. has instructions for what to do if you get one of these calls. If you think you may owe taxes, hang up and call the agency directly at 1-800-829-1040 to ask about your status. If you are confident that you do not owe any taxes, report the fraud to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration at 1-800-366-4484; you can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at ftccomplaintassistant.gov. The Internal Revenue Service does not initiate contact about payments with taxpayers over email, text message or social media. If you receive electronic communication out of the blue from someone claiming to be from the agency, report it to phishing@irs.gov You can find more information on what to do in other suspicious situations at irs.gov/uac/Report-Phishing. Tracking Charges From Amazon Q. I frequently order things from Amazon, but my credit card bill does not list or itemize what I buy. Is there any way to see a list of what was purchased for each charge so I can make sure no one has stolen my card number and slipped in a few orders on my bill? A. If your credit card statement just shows a charge amount without an order number or other identifying information, you can check it against your order history page on Amazon's site. To do so, log into your account on Amazon's site and click the Your Account menu at the top of the page. From the menu, select Your Orders and provide your password again. Once you do, you see a full record of everything you have bought from Amazon, including order dates and total charges for each shipment. (You can also download a spreadsheet listing your purchases for a specified period, as explained at http://amzn.to/1fZt7bj). If you compare the last month's purchases with the list of charges on your credit card bill and find some that do not match, report it to Amazon (which may be able to explain the unfamiliar charge) and to your credit card company. TIP OF THE WEEK Grabbing credit and debit card numbers is a top goal for many scammers, but many banks and credit card companies are stepping up account protection with optional alerts that can warn you of suspicious activity. You can, for example, request text messages for events like an A.T.M. withdrawal over a certain amount or a purchase made without the card being physically present at the point of sale. To see what services are available from your financial institution, log into your account on its website or visit a branch to get help setting up alerts; many companies also have mobile apps so you can manage your account more easily on the go. Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, American Express, Wells Fargo, USAA and Bank of America are among the many companies offering banking alerts for security as well as for standard transactions like due payments and posted deposits.

"Once Bitten, Twice Shy, Except When It Comes to Fraud","The federal judge overseeing the criminal case against Jordan Belfort, the felon depicted in the movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" had bad news last month for the syndicated newsmagazine ""Inside Edition."" He denied its request for a list of Mr. Belfort's 1,300 victims. The potential harm that could come from releasing the list to the public is ""substantial,"" wrote Judge John Gleeson of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, citing the danger of ""sucker lists"" coveted by fraudsters on the prowl for easy marks.  Financial criminals go to great lengths to hunt down and size up their prey, buying lists of investment seminar attendees, mailing out postcards and spamming investors with email and phone calls. But to the con man, nothing can top the ""sucker list."" ""It's pretty well known in the fraud world that the best list to get is the list of people who have already been taken,"" said Doug Shadel, an expert on fraud schemes and the elderly at AARP in Seattle. ""The judge is right not to let the public see that list because those are the most vulnerable people."" More than 8,000 complaints were lodged with the National Consumers League last year, with victims reporting everything from phishing scams to ""sweetheart swindles"" in which con artists nurture an online relationship and persuade victims to send them money. Among non-Internet scams, though, the fastest growing frauds were those in which investors who already had been victimized were singled out again, according to Fraud.org, a project run by the consumers league. The technique has been used to home in on victims of prominent swindles. In 2010, a sham Nigerian website sought out victims of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, claiming to have found $1.3 billion of Madoff assets that would be distributed to victims if they would supply the claim numbers from their legal filings and copies of their most recent brokerage account statements. The site, I-Sipc.com, was shut down after regulators caught on. The Securities and Exchange Commission called it ""a fake mirror image of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation's (SIPC) website."" SIPC is a nonprofit organization that provides some financial protection to customers when brokerage firms fail. Mr. Shadel said he was surprised at first to learn that con artists preferred to focus on investors who had already fallen for scams because he expected that victims would be on guard. ""Why would you want to call somebody who just lost $10,000 to an oil and gas scam?"" he asked. But during interviews with con artists over his career as a consumer advocate and a special assistant to the Washington State attorney general, Mr. Shadel learned that, in the view of criminals, the victim who has lost $10,000 in an energy scam has passed the test of being willing to write a large check to a stranger over the phone, making him a perfect choice. ""Con men told me the first thing they do is let the person rant and rave about their losses, and they write down everything the person says,"" Mr. Shadel said. Just like the burglar who goes into a jewelry store the day before they rob it, ""They're casing the mind of the victim by finding out what their hot buttons are."" Victims get on criminals' radar screens ""basically because they respond to something,"" said Anthony Pratkanis, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz who has listened to 645 audiotapes of criminals pitching undercover investigators. Con artists compile names of people who have gone to investment seminars, dropped a business card in a fish bowl at a restaurant or signed up for a free trial of an investment newsletter, he said. They also find their prey by buying lists of people who have responded to mailings for free sweepstakes. A list that is currently offered online zeros in on ""a unique blend of interest-sourced responders"" who have both entered a sweepstakes and successfully applied for credit. In his 2012 book ""Outsmarting the Scam Artists,"" Mr. Shadel told the story of one boiler-room operator who hired an attractive young woman ""to go to work for a competing boiler room"" so that she could steal the competitor's list. Law enforcement authorities sometimes seize documents that include lead sheets that have been marked up by criminals who profiled their targets, Professor Pratkanis said. ""There are a lot of handwritten notes"" on those lists that mention favorite sports teams, the targets' professions and illnesses like Alzheimer's, he said. Criminals pass those sheets around, enabling others in a boiler room to make a fresh pitch with some inside knowledge about the person on the other end of the phone. The Seattle Seahawks fan might receive a phone call during which the con artist laments a loss by the team on the previous night, Professor Pratkanis said. Experts on fraud say the most vulnerable victims are those who have experienced some negative life event, like a death of a spouse, a negative change in finances or serious injury or illness in the family. ""Events like these chew up your cognitive capacity,"" Mr. Shadel said, ""so you might not do the safe practices you used to."" When AARP compared fraud victims with nonvictimsin a study earlier this year, they found that victims were more likely to click on pop-up ads, sign up for free trial offers and to post their personal schedules or calendars online. The primary target for investment frauds is a male in his 50s or 60s with high financial literacy, Professor Pratkanis said. Con artists flatter and bond with targets who consider themselves to be savvy investors, he said. ""They say 'You are an investor, you know what's going on.' "" John Lawlor, a lawyer on Long Island who specializes in fraud cases, said he derives most of his business from wealthy small-business people who fall for scams after being cold-called at their offices. Some are singled out from lists of business owners compiled by Dun & Bradstreet, and others have responded to offers for a free research report or a newsletter about stocks that pay high dividends. Sometimes cold-callers even pitch Mr. Lawlor, reaching him as early as 7 a.m. to promote bogus investments. ""I mess with them for a while,"" he said, by pulling up their regulatory records and asking pointed questions about the risks of the product they're selling. Ultimately, Mr. Lawlor tells his callers, ""I sue guys like you for a living."" And then, finally, Mr. Lawlor said, ""They hang up on me.""                       "
Apple Says It Will Add New Security Measures After Celebrity Hack,"Apple said on Thursday that it would strengthen its security measures after a recent episode where hackers broke into the Apple accounts of a number of celebrities, stole their nude photos and leaked them on the Internet.  The company said it would add alerts to tell people about activities that could be signs of a break-in. Customers will receive emails and alerts called push notifications, which are messages that show up prominently on iPhones and iPads, when someone tries to change the password for their iCloud account, upload their backed-up account data to a new device or log into their accounts for the first time from an unknown device, the company said. The notifications will be added in two weeks. In the past, Apple customers were receiving emails only when someone changed their account password or logged in from a new device. They received no notification or email when someone loaded an iCloud backup onto another device. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news in an interview with the company's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook. A company spokesman declined to comment further than what was stated in the interview. Over Labor Day weekend, nude photos of celebrities including Jennifer Lawrence and the model Kate Upton spread on the Internet like wildfire. Early news reports pointed to a widespread breach of  iCloud, Apple's online storage service, as a possible source of the leak. However, Apple earlier this week said that after a 40-hour investigation, the company concluded that there was no breach of its data servers. The company has said it discovered a number of celebrity accounts were compromised by targeted attacks, using methods like phishing or correctly answering security questions to obtain their passwords. It said it was working with law enforcement officials to investigate the case. "
Block That Scam,"My godfather is nearing 80. He retired comfortably but is not rich. Over dinner, he mentioned some projects that made my husband and me fear that he is being taken advantage of: He sent $15,000 to a foreign country to help an aid group build a farm; he sold his home to an overseas buyer, but first he redecorated it to suit the purchaser's taste. He is independent and seems sharp, but these stories set off alarm bells. Should we share our concerns? Anonymous, Detroit  Speak up, Goddaughter! But before you do, consider the ''Case of the Conned Columnist,'' who was swindled out of several thousand dollars a few years back, in a not terribly sophisticated phishing scam. (That's when thieves disguise their email addresses to look like those we trust to trick money out of us.) It was a wee bit cleverer than phony emails from the Irish Lottery -- we won! -- or those darling Nigerian princes, but not much. And I was 42 at the time. So, let's not generalize about age. Frame your remarks like this: ''Online crooks are getting so ingenious. Would you like Bill to take a look at these deals? He's a computer maven.'' Brace yourself for a little defensiveness up front. No one likes to think of himself as a patsy. And offer to confer with your godfather in the future. After my swindle, I heard of scores of scams. The main thing they had in common? We victims were so exhilarated by the fantasy (a fruit farm for the needy, a cut-price lamp for the greedy) that we hit ''send'' before talking it out with flesh-and-blood friends first. We all need a sensible ear. Bike Lane Bullies I live in Brooklyn, where most bike lanes are labeled one-way. But many cyclists ride in the wrong direction. It's called ''salmoning.'' When I encounter them, I am terrified and furious because I am often pushed into traffic to avoid hitting oncoming bikers. Screaming ''Wrong way!'' meets with blank stares. Any better ideas? Annie, Brooklyn Salmoning, phishing -- this column is like a trip to Sea World. I love the uptick of cycling in our city. But color me cranky when it comes to wrong-way cyclists (and red-light runners). They are dangerous to pedestrians, fellow pedalers and the shiny finishes of upscale automobiles. Shouted-out comments rarely work, though I am perplexed by the blank stares you get in return. (I would have expected more middle fingers.) Shouting is hostile, even when our point is well taken, and unlikely to persuade. Stop your bike and wave down oncoming cyclists. Then say (very politely): ''Please don't force either of us into traffic. Follow the one-way rules.'' This may work with a (rare) breed of cyclist. But sadly, the real solution is for the police to give tickets to offenders. I know this didn't go smoothly with Alec Baldwin. But once the general ridership understands that noncelebrities will be punished, too, it won't take long for us to straighten up and ride right. Dial 311 for complaints (about wrong-way riders, not me -- or Alec Baldwin). Don't Rile Granny My girlfriend and I visited her 90-year-old grandmother in the Adirondacks. My girlfriend's mother was also visiting. The grandmother spends much of the day in a comfy chair in the living room, perfectly positioned for TV watching. One morning, she was drinking tea on the porch, so I sat in the comfy chair. The mother came to me and said, ''As soon as Grandmother comes inside, vacate the chair.'' Then my girlfriend came downstairs and told me to get out of the chair immediately. She said her grandmother would not come indoors otherwise. I disagreed. Why should I give up the chair proactively? Jay, Philadelphia Finally! Someone brave enough to broach the cruel politics of the comfy chair. Does Jay not have a comfort-seeking bottom? If we prick him, does he not bleed? Still, it is hard to take the measure of other people's families from afar. Granny may fly into murderous rages if someone sits in her comfy chair. If she is related to Showtime's ''Ray Donovan,'' dead bodies may be buried beneath it. (Or the family may be kid-gloving an elderly relative.) My view: If one or more descendants of your hostess asks you to move your visiting booty from the comfy chair, lay aside your pressing concerns and do so. Thrift Shop vs. Preppy My sister is starting college at the same school where I will be a junior this fall. She wears only clothes from thrift shops: tight velvet jackets, embroidered blouses, wild-colored jeans. I've tried telling her she is not going to fit in; it's a preppy school. But she won't listen. What should I do? Amy, New York Unfortunately (for you), your sister sounds like a style disciple of Jimi Hendrix, who may be the chicest rocker of all time. What's more, college is a time when many of us find our own tribes. Your sister may not fit into yours, but I'm guessing that a creative and independent young woman will fit in somewhere. Don't sweat it. No one will judge you for your sister's wardrobe. For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com or SocialQ on Facebook.

Ways to Protect Yourself After the JPMorgan Hacking,"The numbers are shocking: Personal information from 76 million households may have been compromised as part of the cyberattack on JPMorgan Chase. That is the equivalent of two out of every three households in the United States, though a small portion of those affected may be overseas. The intrusion compromised the names, addresses, phone numbers and emails of those households, and can basically affect anyone -- customers past and present -- who logged onto any of Chase and JPMorgan's websites or apps. That might include those who get access to their checking and other bank accounts online or someone who checks their credit card points over the web. Seven million small businesses also were affected.  While nobody knows what the hackers are planning to do with the data from JPMorgan -- if anything at all -- privacy experts say the biggest risk is that the thieves will try to extract more sensitive information from affected consumers. ''It would give the thief a call log of who to victimize, but that in and of itself is not enough to steal someone's identity,'' said Matt Davis, a senior victims adviser at the Identity Theft Resource Center. ''That is the silver lining there.'' There is no evidence that account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers were compromised, according to the bank, nor did the bank suggest that customers change their passwords. ''I think it is always good practice to regularly watch your accounts,'' said Trish Wexler, a JPMorgan spokeswoman. ''That is just good financial hygiene.'' It is possible that the thieves could sell the JPMorgan data to others, who could then combine it with publicly available information, found through census data or social media, said Pam Dixon, executive director at the World Privacy Forum, a public interest research group. They could then create sophisticated -- and very convincing -- emails that targeted individual consumers, a practice known as spear phishing. The goal is to trick consumers into providing Social Security numbers or user names and passwords. ''I would be very conscious of the email you get in the next year, which could be related to this hack,'' Ms. Dixon said. ''They are really hard to detect. It's not like, 'Send me money in the Philippines.' '' Legitimate financial services companies, retailers, cellphone companies, government agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and other providers will not (or at least should not) request personal information in an email. But if a customer detects something suspicious about an email, they should contact the company that supposedly sent it. They should not, however, use the phone number in the email -- that is likely only to put them in touch with the criminals. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also advises consumers to enter website addresses manually (or, at least, to do a web search for them). In other words, do not follow links inside the email. If a customer's bank account ultimately is compromised, they will not be held liable for any unauthorized transactions, but they should contact JPMorgan immediately. Those who want to add a layer of security to their financial life should consider a ''security freeze,'' one of the strongest tools against theft because it prevents someone from trying to open a new account in a consumer's name. When you freeze your reports, the big three credit bureaus will not release your credit reports to any company that does not already have a relationship with you. Financial providers and other companies typically request such reports before issuing a new account. Consumers need to approach each of the three credit bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- and may need to pay a small fee, depending on where they live. The process can be a hassle because the freeze has to be ''thawed,'' or lifted, to apply for a new credit card, for instance, or for a mortgage. (And consumers may need to keep PINs and other information handy to do that). But the extra effort may be easier than trying to undo the mess created by a thief. Then there is the boilerplate advice that all consumers should heed: Regularly monitor all of your accounts; read every transaction on your credit statement every month; and check each of your three credit reports regularly, which you are allowed to do free at least once a year through AnnualCreditReport.com. Consumers may be desensitized by now, given the frequency and breadth of cyberattacks on retailers like Home Depot, Target, Michaels, Neiman Marcus and others. Many may even assume that some hacker, somewhere, already has at least some of their personal information. ''Security is out of your control,'' said Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert. ''The only thing you can do is agitate for laws about regulating third-party use of your data and how they store it, use it and collect it.'' Safety Tips: THE BIGGEST RISK: Spear phishing. Thieves try to extract sensitive data using information they already have. PREVENTION: Don't give personal information to any alleged provider over email or the phone. "
The Most Serious Threat When Using Credit: You,"It was hard not to feel helpless this week after the news that the president himself sought weekly briefings this summer about the cyberattacks against JPMorgan Chase and other financial services companies. Who was it? What did they want? Nobody knew. One rational response for individuals would be to shore up defenses. Get a security freeze on your credit files and thwart the efforts of thieves trying to open new credit card accounts in your name. Use two-factor authentication systems at whatever sites offer them, in case someone gets their hands on your username and password. And please, do not click on any links in emails purporting to be from Chase or other card issuers; they might be from thieves phishing for additional personal information. But this is also a good time to remind ourselves that we often worry too much about the wrong things. The biggest threat to our financial lives is probably not that thieves will get their hands on our payment card information. Instead, we should concern ourselves with the way we quietly chip away at our own net worth by using credit cards too much in the first place. A handful of academic researchers have studied what goes on inside our heads when credit cards are in our wallets, and even people who do not carry a balance each month are prone to overspending for a variety of reasons.  One of the most well-known studies, published in 2001 and titled ''Always Leave Home Without It,'' showed that in certain contexts, people were willing to pay up to twice as much for the same item when paying with a credit card instead of cash. This is known as the ''credit card premium.'' A study in 2008, titled ''Monopoly Money,'' featured a gift card denominated in dollars. Even though the gift card lost value instantly when people used it, people were still more likely to spend freely with it than they did with cash. And a 2011 study showed that people considering using credit cards tended to focus more heavily on product features when shopping, while cash buyers paid closer attention to costs. This all seems perfectly logical on the face of it. People will spend more using credit cards since the pain of paying is further away, by at least a month or so. Even with a gift card, which is akin to the debit cards so many people use today, users are one step removed from having green cash money leave their flesh-and-blood hands. And credit card users who focus more on the features of the item they are shopping for instead of price are more likely to lean toward feature- (and cost-) laden goods. The mere appearance of a card logo in some of these experiments caused many test subjects to spend more. But the most surprising thing about these studies? When I tracked down many of their authors this week, I found that they, too, can't quite kick the credit card habit. Why doesn't Joydeep Srivastava, co-author of the Monopoly money study, use a debit card or cash? ''Mostly because my credit card is giving me lots of miles,'' he said. This is exactly what the credit card companies want us to think, and the math works for them. They buy the frequent-flier miles for a penny or two each from the airlines (or mint their own points that cost them a similar amount) and sit back and hope that we will pay lots of interest or at least buy more than we otherwise would have. Mr. Srivastava, a professor of marketing and consumer psychology at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, pays his bill off each month and doesn't think he falls victim to the credit card premium. When he was doing the research that led to the paper, he switched to using a debit card for a while to establish his baseline for expenses. Now, he watches carefully to make sure he doesn't exceed that level when using a credit card. Priya Raghubir, Mr. Srivastava's co-author, happened to be moving to New York City when their research was published in 2008. ''I've never in my life been in greater debt,'' she said, laughing at the memory now. ''I knew all about how credit cards work, but it wasn't my fault. All you need to do to take a taxi here is swipe a card.'' Six years later, her spending is more under control. She has experimented with using cash as much as possible and trying to see how long a large withdrawal could last, but it made her feel poor. Some of her recent academic research at New York University's Stern School of Business, where she is a marketing professor, led her to a new credit card that delivered more rewards. She noted proudly that her son had taken the research to heart, controlling his spending by using cash for discretionary purchases when he goes out. When I told Drazen Prelec, co-author of the ''Always Leave Home Without It'' research, which cheekily alluded to the old American Express slogan, about my own rewards lust, he suggested that it might be time for some therapy. I had hoped that he would set me straight himself, but he has his own uneven history with the incentive industrial complex. Once upon a time Mr. Prelec, a professor of economics at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, refused to collect frequent-flier miles (or even coffeehouse stamp cards) because he thought they cluttered his decision making. When he began to have second thoughts, he still resisted collecting miles for a while longer because it might remind him of all of the free trips he had already missed out on. Now, he doesn't leave home without his ... wait for it ... American Express card. Why not go debit-only? ''The rational answer is, it's the points,'' he said, given that few debit cards offer reward points. He redeems Amex's Membership Rewards points for free travel. People pay a kind of premium to use a debit card, he added, payable in the risk that a thief could pull lots of money out of your checking account and cause automated payments to bounce. Mr. Prelec uses his debit card for plenty of items anyway. But he whips out the Amex card for travel purchases, plus some gifts and larger expenses. His tactics come straight from his research, which showed that people were mostly likely to overspend with credit cards on things where the value was uncertain. Scalped tickets for sports and concerts are a prime example, as are other experiences and one-off items that we don't buy often. He does think he is safe using plastic to buy travel, since he knows exactly what a plane ticket or hotel is supposed to cost. Even in that category, however, he runs into ambiguity. He wasn't sure, for instance, what the value of an extra day in Paris ought to be when he had the opportunity to pay an airline to extend a layover. To Zac Bissonnette, author of a forthcoming book about Beanie Baby mania and the enormous amount of money that people once paid for them, any credit card use in pursuit of rewards is just further evidence of our continuing delusions about our own self-control. Given what the research has shown, he compares people who think they can keep themselves from spending more on reward cards than they would with debit or cash to climate-change deniers. Alas, the trend is heading in the opposite direction. First Data, which processes debit and credit transactions, reports that in recent quarters, the growth in credit card spending has outpaced the growth in debit card spending. This may be because of loosening credit standards, fear of security breaches or something else. If more payments move to phones, we will need to be ever more aware of the way our brains work when making purchases. A smartphone is an additional step removed from cash, after all. At least people who have had bad experiences with debt or identity theft might recall those things each time they pull out a plastic payment card. Not so with a shiny iPhone and Apple Pay. What would really be useful is some kind of physical reminder, an app of some sort that turns itself on when it senses that a phone payment is about to happen. A little jolt of electricity would be nice, just to deliver the same kind of vivid feeling that we used to get once upon a time when parting with our hard-earned paper money.

Criminal Card Games,"What is it going to take to get serious about data breaches? I ask this question in the wake of the recent Home Depot breach, in which the ''bad guys'' -- presumably cybercriminals in Russia -- apparently penetrated the company's point of sale terminals and came away with an untold number of credit and debit card data. (Home Depot acknowledges that all 2,200 stores in the United States and Canada were likely hacked, but hasn't yet revealed the number of cards from which data were stolen.) This, of course, comes after the Target breach of late 2013, in which some 40 million people had their credit card information stolen. Which comes after the Global Payments breach of 2012 and the Sony breach of 2011. All of which come after the T.J. Maxx breach of 2007, in which 94 million credit and debit card records were stolen in an 18-month period.  That's right: Seven years have passed between the huge T.J. Maxx breach and the huge Home Depot breach -- and nothing has changed. Have we become resigned to the idea that, as a condition of modern life, our personal financial data will be hacked on a regular basis? It is sure starting to seem that way. The Home Depot breach came to light in the usual way. On Sept. 2, a reporter named Brian Krebs, who specializes in cybercrime and operates the website Krebs on Security, broke the news to his readers. Krebs, who is as deeply sourced as any reporter in the country, almost always breaks the news of a new breach. He also reported that the ''malware'' had been doing its dirty work at Home Depot since April or May. And he discovered that millions of card numbers were being sold on a website called Rescator.cc, which Bloomberg Businessweek recently described as the ''Amazon.com of the black market.'' (Interestingly, they are being sold in batches under the names ''American Sanctions'' and ''European Sanction'' -- an apparent reference to the recent sanctions against Russia.) The company -- ''always the last to know,'' Krebs says -- hastily pulled together some security experts who, sure enough, confirmed the breach. In this instance, Home Depot released a statement saying that it was investigating the breach on Sept. 3, the day after the Krebs report, and confirmed the breach on Sept. 8. As these things go, that's lightning speed. Of course, in its materials, the company insists that it cares deeply about its customers' data and will stop at nothing to plug the leak. But the damage has already been done. Home Depot also claims that debit card P.I.N.'s were not stolen. There is little solace in that, however; the crooks use weak bank security to change the P.I.N., after which they can use it. Sure enough, Krebs's banking sources have told him that they ''are reporting a steep increase over the past few days in fraudulent A.T.M. withdrawals on customer accounts.'' Why the rash of breaches? ''It's easy money,'' said Avivah Litan, a security expert at Gartner Inc. ''The criminals are distributing this malware, so why not use it? It's like winning the lottery.'' Kurt Baumgartner, a senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, noted that months before the attack on Home Depot began, the F.B.I. alerted retailers about being more vigilant about point-of-sale cyberattacks. The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Home Depot had, in fact, begun the process of strengthening its systems. But it moved so slowly that the criminals had months to vacuum card data before being discovered. Meanwhile, Bloomberg Businessweek found two unnamed former Home Depot managers who claimed that they were told to ''settle for 'C-level security' because ambitious upgrades would be costly and might disrupt the operation of critical business systems.'' For years, the banks and the retail industry have spent more time accusing each other of causing the problem than seeking a solution. By October 2015, the United States is supposed to move to a more secure card system, using a chip and P.I.N. instead of a magnetic stripe, as Europe did years ago. But even that won't put an end to data breaches. It will make it harder and more expensive for criminals to crack, but not impossible. Which is why the federal government needs to get involved. With the banks and retailers at loggerheads, only the government has the ability to force a solution -- or at least make it painful enough for companies with lax security to improve. As it turns out, there are plenty of congressional initiatives to crack down on companies with weak data security, including a bill that was filed in February and co-sponsored by Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. When I asked someone in Markey's office whether the bill was getting any traction, she replied, ''It's 2014.'' Apparently, we're on our own. "
Postal Service Discloses Major Theft of Its Employees' Personal Data,"WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service on Monday became the latest government agency to announce a major theft of data from its computer systems, telling its roughly 800,000 employees and retirees that an attack ''potentially compromised'' databases containing postal employees' names, birth dates, addresses and Social Security numbers. The announcement came just weeks after the White House disclosed an intrusion into its unclassified computer systems, which resulted in a shutdown of some of its communications while the malicious software was being removed.  The working assumption at the White House was that its troubles were caused by Russian hackers; the Postal Service attack, by contrast, seemed to have the signature of Chinese hackers. But attributing attacks is difficult, and first indications are frequently inaccurate. ''It's an unfortunate fact of life these days that every organization connected to the Internet is a constant target for cyberintrusion activity,'' Patrick R. Donahoe, the postmaster general, said in a written statement. ''The United States Postal Service is no different. Fortunately, we have seen no evidence of malicious use of the compromised data.'' The statement also indicated that the intruders may have obtained telephone numbers and email addresses of Postal Service customers who contacted the agency's customer care center between the beginning of the year and mid-August. But there was no evidence, the statement said, that credit card numbers or other information from transactions with the Postal Service was affected. The F.B.I., which conducts cyberespionage investigations, confirmed in a statement that it was examining ''the nature and scope of this incident.'' But it said nothing about who, or what country, might be responsible. The agency most likely knows more than it is saying: For years the F.B.I., with the help of the National Security Agency, tracked the activities of Unit 61398 and other People's Liberation Army units believed responsible for cyberespionage against both the United States government and private targets. But it took years before it acted, when the Justice Department, in May, indicted five members of the P.L.A. The subject of cyberattacks is bound to come up in the discussions underway in Beijing between President Obama and Xi Jinping, China's president. But there has been little to no progress, officials report, since they discussed the issue at length in a meeting in California 17 months ago, and the indictment led to the suspension of dialogue between working groups on the issue established by each government. If the attack was Chinese in origin, it raises the question of what the value would be in obtaining personal information about employees and customers. Unlike the White House, the Postal Service does not handle much classified or otherwise secret information. But some cyberexperts speculate that what the intruders are seeking is an understanding of how federal computer systems operate, and what kinds of data were available. In the cases of attacks this year on Target and Home Depot, which have generally been attributed to Eastern European criminal groups, there has been no evidence of credit card fraud or the use of personal data -- leaving a mystery about what the cyberintrusion was intended to reveal. On black markets, email information has some value, and Social Security numbers have even more. But it is not clear why intruders would be interested in postal employees. Mr. Donahoe wrote that ''as a result of this incident we have significantly strengthened our systems against future attacks,'' raising questions about why those systems were not upgraded years ago. Postal Service officials said that the data files that were compromised had records on over 800,000 current or past employees, from the top executives to postal clerks in remote locales. The service said it was offering all of them free credit monitoring for a year, similar to a step Home Depot took after its recent discovery of the theft of consumer data. The Postal Service was notified of the breach by its office of the inspector general in mid-September. It was unclear why it took nearly two months to notify the employees. "
A Funeral Fraud,"The subject line of the email usually says something like ""funeral notification"" or perhaps ""your friend's memorial service."" It appears to come from a funeral home, maybe even a real funeral home.  When you open the email, the message extends condolences and provides a link to use to learn more about ""the celebration of your friend's life,"" or similar wording. It doesn't mention a name, but the phrases themselves are enough to make you wonder: Who died? Alert from the Federal Trade Commission: This is a scam, recently hatched and circulating widely. Clicking on the link loads malicious software onto your computer, allowing the scammers to steal personal information and passwords, to gain access to accounts and to spam others on your list of contacts. Delete the email and don't - don't - click on the link. Even veteran monitors of scummy attempts at fraud - some of the F.T.C.'s staff got phony funeral notices - describe this as some sort of record for stonyheartedness. ""How low can you be, to prey on someone's fear of losing a loved one?"" asked Nat Wood, an assistant director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection. ""It's despicable."" The commission hasn't seen evidence that the email targets seniors in particular. ""The scammers approach this as an exercise in volume,"" Mr. Wood said. ""They send these to as many people as they can,"" betting that at least some will bite. But I'm passing the warning along here, thinking that older adults could be particularly vulnerable. Who else goes to as many funerals, sadly? Losing one's peers is one of the tougher parts of aging. And there's some evidence that older people are more trusting and less able to spot deception, though the research recounted by my colleague Judith Graham was based on visual cues, not bogus email. So be careful and warn the older computer users you know. If they're wondering whether someone they care about has actually died, ""they'd be better off checking with the funeral home or with someone who would have knowledge of a person,"" Mr. Wood advised. Those already victimized by these digital thieves will have to run antivirus programs to cleanse their computers. The F.T.C. offers advice on how to do that here.  "
Syria War Stirs New U.S. Debate on Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON -- Not long after the uprising in Syria turned bloody, late in the spring of 2011, the Pentagon and the National Security Agency developed a battle plan that featured a sophisticated cyberattack on the Syrian military and President Bashar al-Assad's command structure. The Syrian military's ability to launch airstrikes was a particular target, along with missile production facilities. ''It would essentially turn the lights out for Assad,'' said one former official familiar with the planning. For President Obama, who has been adamantly opposed to direct American intervention in a worsening crisis in Syria, such methods would seem to be an obvious, low-cost, low-casualty alternative. But after briefings on variants of the plans, most of which are part of traditional strikes as well, he has so far turned them down, according to officials familiar with the administration's long-running internal debate. Syria was not a place where he saw strategic value in American intervention, and even covert attacks -- of the kind he ordered against Iran during the first two years of his presidency -- involved a variety of risks.  The considerations that led Mr. Obama to hesitate about using the offensive cyberweapons his administration has spent billions helping develop, in large part with hopes that they can reduce the need for more-traditional military attacks, reflect larger concerns about a new and untested tactic with the potential to transform the nature of warfare. It is a transformation analogous to what happened when the airplane was first used in combat in World War I, a century ago. The Obama administration has been engaged in a largely secret debate about whether cyberarms should be used like ordinary weapons, whether they should be rarely used covert tools or whether they ought to be reserved for extraordinarily rare use against the most sophisticated, hard-to-reach targets. And looming over the issue is the question of retaliation: whether such an attack on Syria's air power, its electric grid or its leadership would prompt Syrian, Iranian or Russian retaliation in the United States. It is a question Mr. Obama has never spoken about publicly. Because he has put the use of such weapons largely into the hands of the N.S.A., which operates under the laws guiding covert action, there is little of the public discussion that accompanied the arguments over nuclear weapons in the 1950s and '60s or the kind of roiling argument over the use of drones, another classified program that Mr. Obama has begun to discuss publicly only in the past 18 months. But to many inside the administration, who insisted on anonymity when speaking about discussions over one of America's most highly classified abilities, Syria puts the issue back on the table. Mr. Obama's National Security Council met Thursday to explore what one official called ''old and new options.'' Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, declined to discuss ''the details of our interagency deliberations'' about Syria. ''But we have been clear that there are a range of tools we have at our disposal to protect our national security, including cyber,'' she said, noting that in 2012 ''the president signed a classified presidential directive relating to cyberoperations that establishes principles and processes so that cybertools are integrated with the full array of national security tools.'' The directive, she said, ''enables us to be flexible, while also exercising restraint in dealing with the threats we face. It continues to be our policy that we shall undertake the least action necessary to mitigate threats.'' One of the central issues is whether such a strike on Syria would be seen as a justified humanitarian intervention, less likely to cause civilian casualties than airstrikes, or whether it would only embolden American adversaries who have themselves been debating how to use the new weapons. Jason Healey, the director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, argues that it is ''worth doing to show that cyberoperations are not evil witchcraft but can be humanitarian.'' But others caution whether that would really be the perception. ''Here in the U.S. we tend to view a cyberattack as a de-escalation -- it's less damaging than airstrikes,'' said Peter W. Singer, a Brookings Institution scholar and co-author of the recently published book ''Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know.'' ''But elsewhere in the world it may well be viewed as opening up a new realm of warfare,'' he said. There's little doubt that developing weapons for computer warfare is one of the hottest arenas in defense spending. While the size of the Army and traditional weapons systems are being cut in the Pentagon budget that was released on Monday, cyberweapons and Special Forces are growth areas, though it is difficult to tell precisely how much the government spends. But Mr. Obama has made no secret of his concerns about using cyberweapons. He narrowed Olympic Games, the program against the Iranian nuclear enrichment program, to make sure that it did not cripple civilian facilities like hospitals. What he liked about the program was that it was covert and that, if successful, it could help buy time to force the Iranians into negotiations. And that is exactly what happened. But when a technological error in the summer of 2010 resulted in the broadcast of the Stuxnet computer worm around the world, ultimately leading to the revelation of the program's origins with the N.S.A. and Unit 8200 of Israel, Mr. Obama's hopes of keeping such programs at arm's length were dashed. Since then, there has been no clear evidence that the United States has used the weapons in another major attack. It was considered during the NATO attacks on Libya in the spring of 2011, but dismissed after Mr. Obama's advisers warned him that there was no assurance they would work against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's antiquated, pre-Internet air defenses. The head of the N.S.A., Gen. Keith B. Alexander, said in an interview last year that such weapons had been used only a handful of times in his eight-year tenure. But Syria is a complicated case, raising different issues than Iran did. In Syria, the humanitarian impulse to do something, without putting Americans at risk or directly entering the civil war, is growing inside the administration. Most of that discussion focuses on providing more training and arms for what are seen as moderate rebel groups. But cyberweapons are in the conversation about stepping up covert action. Part of the argument is that Syria is a place where America could change its image, using its most advanced technology for a humanitarian purpose. ''The United States has been caught using Stuxnet to conduct a covert cybercampaign against Iran as well as trawling the Internet with the massive Prism collection operation,'' Mr. Healey wrote recently, referring to the N.S.A.'s data-mining program. ''The world is increasingly seeing U.S. cyberpower as a force for evil in the world. A cyberoperation against Syria might help to reverse this view.'' Yet that would require openly taking credit for an attack, something the United States has never done. ''The question is whether the president would be willing to give the kind of speech he gave about why it would be justified to shoot off missiles in response to Assad's use of chemical weapons,'' a senior administration official said. Mr. Obama pulled back from that strike at the last moment. Even if the United States wanted to act covertly, a cyberattack on Syria would be hard to keep secret. Anything that grounded the air fleet, or turned out the lights at key facilities in Damascus and at major military outposts, would be instantly noticed -- and would not necessarily be accomplished quickly. American military planners concluded after putting together options for Mr. Obama over the past two and a half years that any meaningful attack on Syria's facilities would have to be both long enough to make a difference and targeted enough to keep from making an already suffering population even worse off. For those and other reasons, there are doubters throughout the military and intelligence establishment. ''It would be of limited utility, frankly,'' one senior administration official said. For instance, an attack could disrupt or shut down the navigational systems for Syria's aircraft, including the Russian-designed Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters that are carrying out many of the so-called barrel-bomb attacks against civilians in Homs and Aleppo. But Syrian commanders would probably just shift to other weapons in their arsenal, like an array of rockets and missiles, including longer-range Scud missiles, that Mr. Assad's forces have already employed with deadly effect. Syria is no stranger to these attacks, either on the receiving or the giving end. A September 2007 strike by Israel that destroyed a nuclear reactor being built in the Syrian desert was accompanied by an ingenious cyberattack that blinded Syria's air defenses. When the Syrian military awoke the next morning, the reactor being built with North Korean help was a smoking hole in the ground, as were some associated facilities. On the offensive end, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which follows these issues, assembled evidence in a report published late last year that the Syrians had used a ''spear phishing'' ploy, which gets the target to click on a link in an email, in this case videos of war atrocities, to identify people who are aiding the rebel groups and get inside their computer systems. And the Syrian Electronic Army, which American intelligence officials suspect is actually Iranian, has conducted strikes against targets in the United States over the past year, including the website of The New York Times. Mostly these have been denial-of-service attacks, annoying and disruptive, but not truly sophisticated. The chances that Syria could manage a significant response are low, American officials and outside experts said. But the precedent could embolden the Russians and the Iranians into taking a greater part in a new and escalating form of warfare. "
U.S. Tries Candor to Assure China on Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON -- In the months before Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's arrival in Beijing on Monday, the Obama administration quietly held an extraordinary briefing for the Chinese military leadership on a subject officials have rarely discussed in public: the Pentagon's emerging doctrine for defending against cyberattacks against the United States -- and for using its cybertechnology against adversaries, including the Chinese. The idea was to allay Chinese concerns about plans to more than triple the number of American cyberwarriors to 6,000 by the end of 2016, a force that will include new teams the Pentagon plans to deploy to each military combatant command around the world. But the hope was to prompt the Chinese to give Washington a similar briefing about the many People's Liberation Army units that are believed to be behind the escalating attacks on American corporations and government networks. So far, the Chinese have not reciprocated -- a point Mr. Hagel plans to make in a speech at the P.L.A.'s National Defense University on Tuesday.  The effort, senior Pentagon officials say, is to head off what Mr. Hagel and his advisers fear is the growing possibility of a fast-escalating series of cyberattacks and counterattacks between the United States and China. This is a concern especially at a time of mounting tensions over China's expanding claims of control over what it argues are exclusive territories in the East and South China Seas, and over a new air defense zone. In interviews, American officials say their latest initiatives were inspired by Cold-War-era exchanges held with the Soviets so that each side understood the ''red lines'' for employing nuclear weapons against each other. ''Think of this in terms of the Cuban missile crisis,'' one senior Pentagon official said. While the United States ''suffers attacks every day,'' he said, ''the last thing we would want to do is misinterpret an attack and escalate to a real conflict.'' Mr. Hagel's concern is spurred by the fact that in the year since President Obama explicitly brought up the barrage of Chinese-origin attacks on the United States with his newly installed counterpart, President Xi Jinping, the pace of those attacks has increased. Most continue to be aimed at stealing technology and other intellectual property from Silicon Valley, military contractors and energy firms. Many are believed to be linked to cyberwarfare units of the People's Liberation Army acting on behalf of state-owned, or state-affiliated, Chinese companies. ''To the Chinese, this isn't first and foremost a military weapon, it's an economic weapon,'' said Laura Galante, a former Defense Intelligence Agency cyberspecialist. She now works for the Mandiant division of FireEye, one of the largest of the many cybersecurity firms seeking to neutralize attacks on corporations from China and other countries, as well as criminal groups and hackers. Administration officials acknowledge that Mr. Hagel, on his first trip to China as defense secretary, has a very difficult case to make, far more complicated than last year. The Pentagon plans to spend $26 billion on cybertechnology over the next five years -- much of it for defense of the military's networks, but billions for developing offensive weapons -- and that sum does not include budgets for the intelligence community's efforts in more covert operations. It is one of the few areas, along with drones and Special Operations forces, that are getting more investment at a time of overall Pentagon cutbacks. Moreover, disclosures about America's own focus on cyberweaponry -- including American-led attacks on Iran's nuclear infrastructure and National Security Agency documents revealed in the trove taken by Edward J. Snowden, the former agency contractor -- detail the degree to which the United States has engaged in what the intelligence world calls ''cyberexploitation'' of targets in China. The revelation by The New York Times and the German magazine Der Spiegel that the United States has pierced the networks of Huawei, China's giant networking and telecommunications company, prompted Mr. Xi to raise the issue with Mr. Obama at a meeting in The Hague two weeks ago. The attack on Huawei, called Operation Shotgiant, was intended to determine whether the company was a front for the army, but also focused on learning how to get inside Huawei's networks to conduct surveillance or cyberattacks against countries -- Iran, Cuba, Pakistan and beyond -- that buy the Chinese-made equipment. Other cyberattacks revealed in the documents focused on piercing China's major telecommunications companies and wireless networks, particularly those used by the Chinese leadership and its most sensitive military units. Mr. Obama told the Chinese president that the United States, unlike China, did not use its technological powers to steal corporate data and give it to its own companies; its spying, one of Mr. Obama's aides later told reporters, is solely for ''national security priorities.'' But to the Chinese, for whom national and economic security are one, that argument carries little weight. ''We clearly don't occupy the moral high ground that we once thought we did,'' said one senior administration official. For that reason, the disclosures changed the discussion between the top officials at the Pentagon and the State Department and their Chinese counterparts in quiet meetings intended to work out what one official called ''an understanding of rules of the road, norms of behavior,'' for China and the United States. The decision to conduct a briefing for the Chinese on American military doctrine for the use of cyberweapons was a controversial one, not least because the Obama administration has almost never done that for the American public, though elements of the doctrine can be pieced together from statements by senior officials and a dense ''Presidential Decision Directive'' on such activities signed by Mr. Obama in 2012. (The White House released declassified excerpts at the time; Mr. Snowden released the whole document.) Mr. Hagel alluded to the doctrine a week ago when he went to the retirement ceremony for Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the first military officer to jointly command the N.S.A. and the military's Cyber Command. General Alexander was succeeded last week by Adm. Michael S. Rogers, who as the head of the Navy's Fleet Cyber Command was a central player in developing a corps of experts who could conduct cyberwarfare alongside more traditional Navy forces. ''The United States does not seek to militarize cyberspace,'' Mr. Hagel said at the ceremony, held at the N.S.A.'s headquarters at Fort Meade, Md. He went on to describe a doctrine of ''minimal use'' of cyberweaponry against other states. The statement was meant to assure other nations -- not just China -- that the United States would not routinely use its growing arsenal against them. In Beijing, the defense secretary ''is going to stress to the Chinese that we in the military are going to be as transparent as possible,'' said Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, ''and we want the same openness and transparency and restraint from them.'' Experts here and in China point out that a lot was left out of Mr. Hagel's statement last week. The United States separates offensive operations of the kind that disabled roughly 1,000 centrifuges in Iran's nuclear program, America's best-known (and still unacknowledged) cyberattack against another state, from the far more common computer-enabled espionage of the kind carried out against the Chinese to gather information about a potential adversary. ''It's clear that cyberspace is already militarized, because we've seen countries using cyber for military purposes for 15 years,'' said James Lewis, an expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''The Chinese have had offensive capabilities for years as well,'' he said, along with ''more than a dozen countries that admit they are developing them.'' "
"With Spy Charges, U.S. Draws a Line That Few Others Recognize","WASHINGTON -- By indicting members of the People's Liberation Army's most famous cyberwarfare operation -- called Unit 61398 but known among hackers as the ''Comment Crew'' -- the Obama administration has turned to the criminal justice system to reinforce its argument that there is a major difference between spying for national security purposes, something the United States does daily, and the commercial, for-profit espionage carried out by China's military. The Chinese argue that the distinction is an American artifact, devised for commercial advantage. They believe that looking for business secrets is part of the fabric of national security, especially for a rising economic powerhouse. And while American officials are loath to admit it, Washington's view has relatively few advocates around the world. The French, for example, were notorious for conducting state-backed corporate espionage long before the Chinese mastered the form. And if they choose, Chinese leaders has ample opportunity to retaliate by making life even harder for American companies.  Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. repeated the we-don't-spy-for-corporate-America argument Monday morning as he unsealed an indictment that included allegations that Unit 61398 had stolen trade secrets for nuclear power plants that would save Chinese firms years of design work, as well as information from inside an American solar energy company that was pursuing a trade complaint against its Chinese competitors. ''The alleged hacking appears to have been conducted for no reason other than to advantage state-owned companies and other interests in China, at the expense of businesses here in the United States,'' Mr. Holder said. ''This is a tactic that the U.S. government categorically denounces. As President Obama has said on numerous occasions, we do not collect intelligence to provide a competitive advantage to U.S. companies, or U.S. commercial sectors.'' There is little doubt, based on the evidence published last year, that the Comment Crew's targets include companies that compete directly with state-owned Chinese enterprises that fund the People's Liberation Army and often line the pockets of its leaders. But they are hardly the only targets of Chinese espionage: The office of the secretary of defense, the firms building the new Joint Strike Fighter, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Aspen Institute and The New York Times have all been targets of Chinese hacking units, for different reasons. But the United States is limited in the complaints it can make because it has targeted similar institutions in China -- for equally murky reasons. So when Mr. Obama raised the issue with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, he focused only on commercial espionage, arguing it is far more pernicious to use the intelligence instruments of the state for a business advantage. The United States may do all it can to learn about China's nuclear arsenal, or Beijing's intentions in its territorial disputes with Japan, but it does not, he says, steal from China Telecom to help AT&T. Prosecutors focused on the most clear-cut commercial cases, perhaps because the United States believes the cases will bolster the president's central argument, that there is something sacred about intellectual property. ''This is not something they pulled out of their back pocket,'' said Kevin Mandia, whose company, the Mandiant division of FireEye, compiled the first public report about Unit 61398 last year. ''This was a logical escalation of the pressure.'' But it was also an effort to regain the high ground the United States lost last year after the revelations made by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor. The documents he revealed suggested that the clear line Mr. Obama talks about when discussing Chinese cyberpractices is often blurry. Even before Mr. Snowden walked out of the Hawaii facilities of the N.S.A. with a trove of documents, it was clear that the United States was not above economic espionage, as long as it was not for the direct benefit of specific companies. For example, the United States spies regularly for economic advantage when the goal is to support trade talks; when the Clinton administration was locked in a high-stakes negotiation in the 1990s to reach an accord with Japan, it bugged the Japanese negotiator's limousine. At the time, the chief beneficiaries would have been the Big Three auto companies and a smattering of parts suppliers. It is also widely believed to be using intelligence in support of trade negotiations underway with European and Asian trading partners. But in the view of a succession of Democratic and Republican administrations, that is fair game. Companies can also be targets. Documents released by Mr. Snowden showed that the American government pried deep into the servers of Huawei, one of China's most successful Internet and communications companies. The documents made clear that the N.S.A. was seeking to learn whether the company was a front for the People's Liberation Army and whether it was interested in spying on American firms. But there was a second purpose: to get inside Huawei's systems and use them to spy on countries that buy the company's equipment. Huawei officials said they failed to understand how that differed meaningfully from what the United States has accused the Chinese of doing. But such reasoning is rejected by the intelligence community. ''I welcome this indictment because it has our government rejecting the false equivalence between us and the Chinese,'' said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of both the N.S.A. and the Central Intelligence Agency. ''It's a risky course of action,'' he added, ''but prior to this we were in stasis.'' It is risky because the Chinese have already declared that they are shutting down, at least for now, the modest talks between the two countries on norms of behavior on the Internet. Those conversations were already fraught. Last month, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel went to Beijing to argue for a new channel of communication between the United States and China on cyberstrategy. American officials had already given the Chinese an overview of American cybersecurity, emphasizing that the N.S.A. did not take what it collects and hand it to Apple or Microsoft or Google. The hope was that it would prompt the Chinese to give Washington a similar briefing about the People's Liberation Army units that are believed to be behind the attacks on American corporations and government networks. So far, the Chinese have not reciprocated. Instead, they have denied that the P.L.A. conducts cyberoperations. When The Times published a n article early last year about Unit 61398, in which it detailed some of the group's operations, there were furious denials from Beijing. For a few weeks, the unit went quiet. Then it came back -- operating from different servers, but often against the same American industrial targets. "
Is NATO a Bulwark in Need of Reform or a Relic?,"The coming NATO summit in Wales in September has inspired a hotly contested debate about the organization's fitness for the 21st century - and even if should exist at all. Many observers are calling for a comprehensive reform, calling it inadequate and outdated, unable to deal with the challenges of today's world, especially Russia's military adventurism in Ukraine. But some commentators in the United States question the alliance's necessity and warn that the country should not involve itself in conflicts in Eastern Europe, a region that they see as irrelevant to the security of the United States.  The reformers include James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and NATO's top commander from 2009 to 2013, who outlined his prescriptions at Foreign Policy, as well as Anne Applebaum, who described a similar plan at The Washington Post. With Russia's aggression in Ukraine, one focus is on redefining NATO's relationship with Russia. Admiral Stavridis would like to see a ""more robust force posture"" in the region, including NATO boots on the ground, ""an aggressive exercise program,"" continuing the implementation of a missile defense system, maritime deployments in the region and support for the Ukrainian military. Ms. Applebaum suggests that President Barack Obama could create a lasting legacy in the last two years of his presidency by reforming the organization. He could ""rewrite"" the NATO treaty, or at least ""restructure it,"" so that it ""functions like a living organism,"" instead of a remnant of the Cold War. He has the power to do that, Ms. Applebaum writes. ""He has all of the cards - the United States contributes three-quarters of NATO's budget - as well as the ultimate argument: If the Western alliance, as currently constituted, no longer wants to defend itself, America can always leave."" NATO should carry out ""annual exercises"" like it did during the Cold War, writes Ms. Applebaum. ""It's time to rehearse our reaction to a Crimean-style Russian invasion of Latvia, led not by regular troops but by 'little green men' pretending to be local Russians."" In an article for The Boston Globe, Admiral Stavridis and Dave Weinstein, a former strategic planner at United States Cyber Command, wrote about the threat of cyberwarfare from Russia. ""Cyberspace has rapidly emerged as an attractive alternative for nations to pursue military objectives,"" he writes, calling for a clause in the NATO treaty that would seek to deter cyberattacks. Both Ms. Applebaum and Admiral Stavridis call on European nations to spend more on defense, ""at a minimum hitting their self-stated goal of 2 percent of G.D.P.,"" Admiral Stavridis writes, pointing out that only a ""handful"" of nations hit even that goal. ""Some Europeans don't want to pay for their defense? Maybe those who want to be covered by Article 5, the alliance's security guarantee, should now be obligated to pay,"" writes Ms. Applebaum. However, Admiral Stavridis notes that the alliance should seek zones of cooperation with Russia. John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, writes at The Los Angeles Times that Washington should revive fast-track plans for membership in the organization for Ukraine. ""The U.S. would eliminate the zone of ambiguity between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia that Putin is exploiting, even if Obama's flaccid leadership has tragically lost Crimea for good."" This kind of deterrence, Mr. Bolton writes, has been effective since NATO's creation and should now be used to prevent future Russian aggression. Other officials who served in past administrations emphasized another aspect of deterrence - the classic Cold War nuclear argument, which they say is as relevant as ever. ""The newer members joined NATO in large part to get under this nuclear umbrella,"" Brent Scowcroft, Stephen J. Hadley and Franklin Miller write at The Washington Post, and these countries are concerned about the possibility of the United States withdrawing its nuclear weapons. With an unpredictable Russia, they write, ""this is no time to destabilize the NATO alliance and traumatize our NATO allies by withdrawing our nuclear weapons from Europe."" But other observers argue for retrenchment from the alliance. Doug Bandow at theCato Institute writes that the push to expand NATO is ""strikingly misguided,"" because ""the end of the Cold War eliminated the reason for creating the alliance."" Daniel Larison offers a critique of Ms. Applebaum's argument at The American Conservative, underlining that ""no one in Europe or in Washington would take it seriously."" The United States can complain all it wants about its allies' subpar contributions to NATO, but ""the message always falls on deaf ears,"" Mr. Larison writes. He says that instead of taking an assertive stance of ""forcing the allies to do more to provide for their own security by reducing how much the U.S. does for them,"" the United States quickly reassures them ""that they won't have to do more,"" which is why the country continues to bear most of the costs. Russian officials naturally see the organization as an outdated, unnecessary threat. NATO is seeking ""a new reason to exist,"" said Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, earlier this month. Alexander Grushko, Russia's envoy to NATO, addedthat the supposed threat from Russia is an excuse to ""build up the eastern flank"" and increase military spending. NATO is trying to ""prove the alliance necessary."" To Mr. Bandow, NATO candidate states, and especially Ukraine, are irrelevant for United States security. ""While Ukraine's status is largely of theoretical interest to America, Russia views its connection to the former Soviet republic to be of critical security importance."" He writes that Europe should take care of its own security.  ""NATO is a military alliance, not a social club."" Mr. Larison also questions Ms. Applebaum's idea of a ""legacy"" proposal. ""Promoting foreign policy ideas with talk of how it will help a president's 'legacy' is a good way to encourage presidents to pursue unrealistic goals that expose them to a lot of unnecessary political risk.""                       "
Cyberattack on JPMorgan Raises Alarms at White House and on Wall Street,"WASHINGTON - President Obama and his top national security advisers began receiving periodic briefings on the huge cyberattack at JPMorgan Chase and nine other financial institutions this summer, part of a new effort to keep top national security officials as updated on major cyberattacks as they are on Russian incursions into Ukraine or Islamic State attacks. But in the JPMorgan case, according to officials familiar with the briefings, no one could tell the president what he most wanted to know: What was the motive of the attack? ""The question kept coming back, 'Is this plain old theft, or is Putin retaliating?' one senior official said, referring to the American-led sanctions on Russia. ""And the answer was: We don't know for sure.'' More than three months after the first attacks were found, the source is still unclear and there is no evidence that any money was taken from any institution. But questions are being asked across Wall Street as other targets emerge. At least three companies - Citigroup, E*Trade Financial and HSBC - found that one of the same web addresses used to penetrate JPMorgan had tried to get into their systems, people briefed on the matter say.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation, after being contacted by JPMorgan, took the I.P. addresses that the hackers were believed to have used to breach JPMorgan's computer system to other financial institutions to see whether the same intruders had tried to hack into their systems as well, these people said. The banks also share information among themselves. The three companies declined to comment. The identities of the other companies could not be learned on Wednesday. JPMorgan has said that the attackers obtained names and some email addresses, but they did not penetrate far enough to get account information, and that there is no evidence of any illicit movement of money across the 76 million affected households. The F.B.I. has begun a criminal inquiry into the attacks, and the Secret Service has been involved as well. But across Wall Street, the scale and breadth of the attacks - and the lack of clarity about the identity or motive of the hackers- shows not only the vulnerability of the most heavily fortified American financial institutions, but the difficulty, despite billions of dollars spent in detection technology, in finding the sources of attack. And because it is so difficult to trace an attack to its source, it is next to impossible to deter one. ""People don't pay a price for attacks,'' the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, said in an interview earlier this year. ""It's one of our biggest challenges.'' Other questions are being asked about what should be the obligation of financial institutions to report such attacks. A number of state attorneys general, led by the Illinois prosecutor Lisa Madigan and the Connecticut attorney general, George Jepsen, have opened investigations into the JPMorgan breach, according to the people briefed on the matter. The inquiries are looking at whether the bank, the nation's largest, alerted customers about the breaches in a timely matter. Any prolonged delay - a lag between when the bank learned that vast stores of information were pilfered and when they alerted customers - could put consumers at risk, the people said. Under federal and state law, JPMorgan did not have to alert customers about the breach because the bank determined that only contact information was breached. Prosecutors in Ms. Madigan's office are discussing whether to update a 2006 Illinois law that requires companies to alert consumers in a timely fashion if their financial information - including Social Security and account numbers - were taken. The debate underway now, the people said, is whether the law should be expanded to also include notification requirements when hackers take only nonfinancial information like email addresses. ""We communicated to customers repeatedly that we had been breached, and hadn't seen unusual fraud levels related to this - first in August, again in mid-September, and most recently last week,"" said Patricia Wexler, a JPMorgan spokeswoman. ""We were careful to get far enough along in our internal investigation to have the most complete information, and wanted to be sure we could confidently say no financial information had been compromise On Tuesday, the offices of Ms. Madigan and Mr. Jepsen held a call with officials at JPMorgan to discuss the attack, the people said. Since the breach at Target last year, prosecutors from both states have been holding monthly calls - part of a broader privacy task force. JPMorgan has repeatedly said that none of the information taken - names, phone numbers, addresses and emails - has led to any incidents of fraud. Furthermore, the bank points out that no money was stolen from customer accounts. But security consultants caution that email addresses may be enough information for hackers to engage in ""phishing"" expeditions to trick customers into providing them with that additional personal information. The breach is under investigation from Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, according to a person briefed on the matter. But actually finding the perpetrators of the attack is a much more daunting task. Thomas G.A. Brown, a senior managing director with FTI Consulting, knows first-hand the difficulty of tracking overseas criminals and bringing them to justice. Until recently, Mr. Brown was chief of the computer and intellectual property crime unit for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan. Mr. Brown oversaw the indictment of Aleksandr Kalinin, a Russian national charged with hacking into some of the computer systems of the Nasdaq stock market in 2011. Mr. Kalinin remains at large. Referring to the challenges of piecing together a portrait of the attackers, Mr. Brown said: ""It's not the equivalent of gunshots being fired, a body on the street, and witnesses who see a person with a gun running away."" The search to determine exactly what the hackers took, and why, gained even more urgency last week, according to several people briefed on JPMorgan's internal investigation. The breach, discovered this summer, was far more extensive than the bank originally realized. This summer, some investigating the breach put the number of compromised accounts at around one million, according to two people briefed on the bank's internal investigation. By last week, as the internal investigation continued, the people said, that number had multiplied exponentially. Bank executives relayed the new details - 76 million households compromised - to its board. Other disclosures have been more subtle. In a regulatory filing in August, as the bank grappled with the breach, JPMorgan said its board and audit committee ""are regularly apprised"" of significant cybersecurity events. That language did not appear in an earlier regulatory filing from 2013 or in an earlier quarterly report. The scale of the intrusion and the fact it went undetected for about three weeks has led some to question whether JPMorgan, which has offices around the world and more than 260,000 employees, is ""too big to secure."" JPMorgan and a number of financial institutions, including E*Trade and Citigroup, were breached before. Last June, the United States attorney in New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, charged eight people in a connection with an attack that resulted in the theft of $15 million. The lead defendant charged in the case is at large and believed to be living in Ukraine. At the time of the charges, Mr. said that ""cybercriminals penetrated some of our most trusted financial institutions as part of a global scheme that stole money and identities from people in the United States.""

The Man Behind the Hacking: Talking to Guccifer," Earlier this month, Andrew Higgins wrote a profile of Guccifer, the hacker famous for accessing the personal email accounts of many public figures and for revealing that former President George W. Bush had taken up painting. Mr. Higgins described what it was like to meet the hacker, Marcel-Lehel Lazar, in a Romanian prison.  For someone who had spent years covering his tracks to elude the F.B.I. and the Secret Service, Marcel-Lehel Lazar turned out to be remarkably easy to meet.  Mr. Lazar, who until his arrest early this year was known only as Guccifer (pronounced GUCCI-fer), set a single condition in agreeing to an interview at the high-security jail in Western Romania's Transylvania region, where he is serving a seven-year sentence for hacking. Before answering questions about how he managed to rampage undetected through the email accounts of the Bush family, Colin L. Powell and scores of celebrities and military and intelligence officials, Mr. Lazar insisted on reading aloud a lengthy handwritten manifesto. That, he said, ""will explain everything."" The only real stumbling block was a sudden last-minute demand by authorities at the Arad Penitentiary that I speak with Mr. Lazar in Romanian, not English, so that they could more easily understand what was being said. They relented after finding a prison official, a psychologist, who spoke excellent English.   Often unable to remember my own email password, I had long been interested in finding out how a hacker of Guccifer's notoriety got into the accounts of complete strangers, particularly presumably well-protected strangers like close relatives of two former presidents, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. I asked the Romanian authorities whether I could talk to Mr. Lazar soon after his arrest in January, but I was told then that he was too busy preparing for his trial. He was, I learned when we finally met in November, also busy meeting with American investigators who had traveled to Romania to meet the man who had outfoxed them for so long. They, too, wanted to find out how he burrowed into so many American computers. The answer, I discovered during a nearly three-hour interview, turned out to be disappointingly banal: Mr. Lazar simply guessed the answers to security questions. His appearance also hardly matched his legendary status as a relentless scourge of the rich and powerful. Dressed in a black leather jacket and a light blue polo shirt, he looked ordinary. And that was where his manifesto came in. Ordinary was the last thing Mr. Lazar wanted to be. As the prosecutor who led the case against him told me, Mr. Lazar wanted more than anything to stand out and be famous - unfortunate impulses for a hacker who needed stay hidden to stay out of jail. The English-speaking prison psychologist, who attended my meeting with the hacker, rolled his eyes as Mr. Lazar started reading his explanatory text in good but heavily accented English. It was a compendium of wild conspiracy theories involving so-called Illuminati, a secret cabal that he believes runs the world. Most of the conspiracies were old hat, like ones relating to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, by Al Qaeda. But others, such as an alleged plan to set off a nuclear bomb in Chicago and an unnamed city in Pennsylvania next year, were clearly his own work. The psychologist said he had heard them all before but nonetheless had no doubt about the state of Mr. Lazar's mental health. ""He is not really crazy at all,"" he said, describing the hacker as a clever man with a lively imagination and a keen desire to be part of something bigger than the small village where he lived until January with his wife and daughter. Mr. Lazar, jobless for years, voiced great pride in what he repeatedly referred to as ""my work,"" a massive archive of stolen emails now posted on cryptome.org. He also boasted that this was just part of an even bigger archive that he has stashed away in the cloud for safekeeping - and perhaps for use as a bargaining chip with the American authorities. The hidden archive, he claimed, included emails he had stolen from the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Mr. Lazar knows not a word of Arabic, so this struck me as far-fetched. Personable and eager to answer questions once he had finished reciting his manifesto, he bristled only when asked whether he had made money from his hacking. ""Not a single buck, not a cent,"" he shouted, clearly annoyed that what he viewed as a righteous mission to pierce the secrecy protecting the rich and powerful might be reduced to mere greed. He cast himself as an anti-secrecy warrior fighting on the same side as the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. Mr. Lazar said his wife knew nothing of what he was up to on the computer, only that he spent an inordinate amount of time online. She was therefore delighted, upon her return from work one day in early January, that he was no longer hunched over his keyboard. Fearing arrest, he had decided to destroy the computer, smashing it to pieces with an ax in his yard. He told his wife it had stopped working. ""Good,"" Mr. Lazar recalled his wife saying. He was arrested a few days later.                       "
Senate to Hold Hearing on Cyberattacks Against Finance,"The Senate Banking Committee plans to hold a hearing next week on ways to ""protect the financial sector"" from cyberattacks, but for now there are no plans to have anyone from the financial services industry testify.  The hearing set for Wednesday will feature testimony from top officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, the Treasury Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The banking committee is holding the hearing in the aftermath of this summer's big cyberattack at JPMorgan Chase that compromised some account information of 83 million households and small businesses. Law enforcement officials have said the same hackers that breached JPMorgan's systems also tried to gain access to the systems of at least a dozen other financial institutions. In October, the banking committee sent a letter to five regulators seeking information about how they were coordinating their work with law enforcement agencies in responding to attacks on the financial system. They were also asked whether legislative proposals were needed to foster a better working relationship. The letter specifically noted the attack on JPMorgan and the need to make sure that government agencies the private institutions work together to maintain the ""integrity of the financial system."" A person briefed on the matter said the hearing would focus on how the various government agencies were working together to deal with cyberattacks on banks and other financial institutions. It's not clear how much of the testimony will discuss the attack on JPMorgan or any other specific financial institution. Patricia Wexler, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said the bank had not been asked to provide the committee with any information in advance of the hearing. A spokeswoman for the Connecticut attorney general, George Jepsen, whose office is overseeing an investigation by several state attorneys generals into the JPMorgan breach, said the state office had not been contacted by the Senate committee. In the JPMorgan attack, the bank has said it found no evidence of any fraud or misuse of customer information. JPMorgan said the hackers got access only to customer email addresses, homes addresses and phone numbers but nothing of a more sensitive nature like Social Security numbers. Over the past several years, cyberattacks on financial institutions have become a matter of increasing concern for regulators who are worried about criminals getting access to sensitive customer financial information or looting accounts. To date, the most serious attacks have taken place in retail, with hackers attempting to get access to credit card account number by breaching the systems at companies like Target and Home Depot. "
"U.S. Weighs Response to Sony Cyberattack, With North Korea Confrontation Possible","WASHINGTON -- A White House official said on Thursday that the administration was considering a ''proportional response'' against those who hacked into Sony Pictures computers, a retaliation that could thrust the United States into a direct confrontation with North Korea.  Officials would not describe what such a response might entail, but they stressed that the episode had become a major concern at the upper levels of government, including President Obama, who lately has been discussing the issue with aides every day. ''This is something that's being treated as a serious national security matter,'' Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters. ''There is evidence to indicate that we have seen destructive activity with malicious intent that was initiated by a sophisticated actor.'' United States officials have privately concluded that North Korea was ''centrally involved'' in the hacking even as Sony canceled the release of a comedy that features the fictional assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and that apparently prompted the cyberattack. Mr. Earnest would not confirm the North Korean role at his daily briefing but he did not deny it either, saying that investigators would ultimately report on their findings. Mr. Earnest said the government did not tell Sony to pull the film, ''The Interview,'' and expressed support for the studio's right to make it, even if it would offend some viewers. ''The United States stands squarely on the side of artists and companies that want to express themselves,'' he said, ''and we believe that that kind of artistic expression is worthy of expression and is not something that should be subjected to intimidation just because you happen to disagree with the views.'' But he was vague about what kind of action the United States might take in response to the cyberattack and even hinted that it may be of a character that was hard to publicly detect. He added that the president and his team would take into consideration that its authors might be trying to stir a response to get attention, a calculation often imputed by Washington to North Korea's mercurial leadership. ''They would be mindful of the fact that we need a proportional response, and also mindful of the fact that sophisticated actors, when they carry out actions like this, are oftentimes -- not always, but often -- seeking to provoke a response from the United States of America,'' Mr. Earnest said. ''They may believe that a response from us in one fashion or another would be advantageous to them. So we want to be mindful of that.'' "
Sony Hacking Fallout Includes Unraveling of Relationships in Hollywood,"LOS ANGELES -- As Washington considers a response to an online attack on Sony Pictures, Hollywood is trying to repair relationships that were shattered by the assault. On Thursday, a day after United States officials identified North Korea as the hand behind the offensive against Sony's now-canceled comedy ""The Interview,"" the White House said it was considering ""a range of actions"" in response. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, called the hacking a ""national security issue."" Sony shelved ""The Interview,"" about the assassination of the North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un, after cancellations by theater owners in the face of a terrorist threat. The studio on Thursday was searching for ways to eventually disseminate the film, but, for the moment, it could find none. Satellite operators, cable providers, or digital portals that might be asked to pick up ""The Interview"" could be exposed to the same online harassment plaguing Sony. The attack has disrupted the web of executive, business and talent relationships that stitches together Sony's core moviemaking operation.  Prominent members of Hollywood's creative community fumed about what they saw as failure by Sony to make a stand for artistic freedom. Steve Carell called it ""a sad day for creative expression,"" while Zach Braff described Sony's move as ""a pretty horrible precedent to set."" The filmmaker Judd Apatow and the documentarian Michael Moore also took to social media to lament the demise of ""The Interview"" as caving to the hackers. The studio's relationship with Adam Sandler, the star of Sony comedies like ""Grown Ups"" and its coming summer tent pole ""Pixels,"" got singed when online news sites published unvarnished executive complaints about his ""mundane, formulaic"" films. The disclosure of racially tinged emails from Amy Pascal, the co-chairwoman of the studio, led her to meet in person on Thursday with black leaders including the Rev. Al Sharpton, who had condemned the exchange between her and the producer Scott Rudin as ""offensive, insulting"" when it first became public. Financiers are unsure whether to proceed with planned deals to back Sony films, as some talent agents -- worried about management stability at Sony and long-term chaos -- consider funneling scripts elsewhere. Even Sony's relations with news outlets have been dealt a lasting blow, with the studio upset about the willingness of some reporters to dig through stolen documents and media contacts given an unusually candid glimpse into how executives try to manipulate coverage. It is nearly impossible to calculate likely financial losses associated with ""The Interview"" until any option for displaying the movie has been closed off. For the moment, the studio is reluctant to consider the option of charging for it online, on the assumption that few consumers would share credit cards with a company under attack by hackers. Over the last week, Sony's attackers began threatening the company's partners in the entertainment industry, beyond just theaters and theater chains, according to security experts who have been consulting with the companies. Several Sony vendors mentioned in the stolen data trove have begun receiving threatening correspondence from the attackers. Security experts said that ""anxiety levels were high"" and many vendors complained on Thursday that Sony's decision to halt the release of ""The Interview"" might only embolden attackers. In a more human calculus, a significant loser in the hacking may be Seth Rogen, the writer-director-star who became the principal public face of ""The Interview."" There was a growing sentiment on the Sony lot that Mr. Rogen and his filmmaking colleagues had exposed employees and the audience to digital damage and physical threat by pushing his outrageous humor to the limit and backing the film to the last. The impression that Mr. Rogen overreached was enforced by the publication of an email in which he reprimanded Ms. Pascal for pressing for relatively minor changes in the assassination scene. ""This is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy,"" Mr. Rogen wrote. ""It's a very damning story."" Mr. Rogen on Thursday declined through a spokesman to comment. Among his future projects at Sony is ""Sausage Party,"" an R-rated animated film about a frankfurter's existential crisis. The strains between Mr. Rogen and Ms. Pascal unraveled only one thread in a Hollywood fabric that was thoroughly shredded by the hacking and ensuing threat. Much of the damage centered on the action, or lack thereof, among high industry executives who never stepped forward to assist Sony. Wednesday's decision to withdraw the film brought public silence from the Motion Picture Association of America and its chief executive, Christopher J. Dodd, who had remained quiet through a three-week media onslaught on Sony. People associated with Mr. Dodd, speaking privately, said he failed to mobilize competing studio chiefs in support of the studio, partly because they feared drawing attention to themselves and partly because they doubted that public statements or actions would be effective. That failure has drawn criticism from senior theater executives, who -- again privately, as they will need to work with Mr. Dodd and the studios -- blame the trade association and Sony for pushing onto them the onus for canceling the film, rather than Sony's taking responsibility for a decision that was sure to offend some freedom-minded filmmakers. Sony sees it differently, having received clear signals that the theater chains simply did not want the movie. Another set of broken or bruised relationships involves black stars and filmmakers, a group with whom Sony formerly had very sturdy ties. More than a few black moviemakers -- notably Kevin Hart, Will Packer, Ice Cube and Will Smith -- have flourished at Sony under Ms. Pascal and Clint Culpepper, who runs Sony's Screen Gems unit. But Ms. Pascal and Mr. Culpepper both got burned by the email dump, which included messages in which she traded racial jokes with the producer Scott Rudin about President Obama's supposed taste in black-themed movies, while Mr. Culpepper was discovered calling Mr. Hart ""a whore"" in reference to growing salary demands. Apologies, public and private, weren't enough. Mr. Sharpton took aim at Ms. Pascal, saying her comments reflected a ""troubling"" lack of diversity in Hollywood. Mr. Sharpton notably did not call for Ms. Pascal's ouster after their 90-minute meeting. He said Ms. Pascal had committed to further action aimed at improving diversity in Hollywood movies and television shows. Nicole Perlroth contributed reporting from San Francisco.

"Computing Offline, Without a Net","Q. Is it possible to use a computer and purposely have it not connected to the Internet so it is not subject to hacking or malware? A. Keeping your computer offline is certainly possible, but doing so would probably limit many of its functions. For instance, software updates, program authentications, email, web browsing, video streaming, online gaming and music downloads all require an Internet connection. Security programs, if you have any installed, also get their updates delivered over the Internet.  Yanking the Ethernet cable or turning off the computer's Wi-Fi receiver cuts it off from the world outside, but you can still use the machine as long as you have the appropriate software installed (or can buy it on disc) before you cut the cord. Among other things, you can use the computer as a high-tech typewriter with word-processing software and a printer directly cabled to it; files can be transferred to other computers via USB drives. You can also use the computer for games and to view multimedia stored on disc or the hard drive. Sharing Audio Through Bluetooth Q. Is there a way to use two Bluetooth headsets simultaneously, so that my wife and I can both watch a movie on our iPad at the same time? A. The wireless Bluetooth technology used by the iPad allows for the audio signal to stream only from one device to another. While you can normally use only one set of headphones at a time with the iPad, third-party accessories may offer a solution. For example, some users have reported success with add-ons like a Kokkia multistream Bluetooth transmitter (starting around $60 at the company's store), which promises to stream the audio from an iOS device to two different headsets. Depending on your iPad model, you might need additional adapters to fit a multistream Bluetooth transmitter to the tablet's connection port, so you may want to do more research before you buy. Although you lose the freedom of a wireless connection, using two sets of wired headphones and a Y-shaped splitter for the iPad's headphone jack is another way to share the sound. Some headphone splitters can be found online for around $5 or less.

A Start-Up With a Way to Filter Botnet Traffic Gets Funding,"Botnets, networks of infected zombie computers that operate at the whim of their controller, are arguably one of the nastiest scourges of the Internet. But security researchers believe they've found a way to filter bot traffic from the real thing for good.  Last October, the well-known security researcher Dan Kaminsky, Michael J. J. Tiffany, Ash Kalb and Tamer Hassan took their small security start-up, White Ops, out of stealth, publicly claiming they had developed technology that could differentiate between so-called ""bots"" and real people. Eight months later, they've secured the confidence of new investors at Paladin Capital Group and Grotech Ventures, who together invested $7 million in their antifraud start-up. If all goes according to plan, White Ops has a huge market opportunity. While hard losses are difficult to track down, as much as 29 percent of display advertising traffic worldwide is driven by zombie computers, according to an estimate from Solve Media, a security firm that estimates that botnets cost advertisers $10 billion last year. In some cases, operators set up websites, pay botnets to flood them with traffic, then trumpet their viewership to legitimate advertisers like Target, or Amazon, and begin collecting checks as zombies flood the ads with fraudulent clicks. In other cases, legitimate websites find they can significantly boost their advertising revenue by paying bots to help them boost their click quotas. ""We've seen entire ad campaigns that have been completely and utterly overrun by bots,"" Mr. Kaminksy said. ""You see a site, at the end of the month, that is 500,000 clicks short, and then 500,000 clicks magically appear."" White Ops' technology differentiates between a person using a web browser on their own computer, and a bot controller directing the web browser on a malware-infested computer from 3,000 miles away using Javascript and Flash, two tools that allow for the development and control of computer interfaces. ""Our discovery is that both Javascript and Flash will also tell you if there's a real user behind that inferface,"" Mr. Kaminsky said. White Ops sells customers one line of code that allows them to differentiate between bot traffic and the real thing. They compare it to Google's analytics service, and White Ops tells website operators how much of their traffic is coming from humans and how much of it is coming from bots. The start-up bases its charges on website volume: a site that typically generates one billion clicks a month will pay more than a site that generates 1,000 clicks. ""In the beginning, advertisers were saying, 'We're afraid to do something,' because fraud was generating so much revenue for the display ad industry,"" Mr. Kaminsky said. ""Now the fraud is large enough that they're saying, 'We're afraid not to do something.' "" On Tuesday, White Ops will also begin selling its expertise to businesses beyond advertisers, who have fallen victim to bots in ways other than ad fraud. Businesses, WhiteOps said, increasingly suffer from similar fraud, such as automated attacks on their websites, or criminals who use bots to charge purchases from stolen credit cards across thousands of sites.

F.B.I. Informant Is Tied to Cyberattacks Abroad,"WASHINGTON -- An informant working for the F.B.I. coordinated a 2012 campaign of hundreds of cyberattacks on foreign websites, including some operated by the governments of Iran, Syria, Brazil and Pakistan, according to documents and interviews with people involved in the attacks. Exploiting a vulnerability in a popular web hosting software, the informant directed at least one hacker to extract vast amounts of data -- from bank records to login information -- from the government servers of a number of countries and upload it to a server monitored by the F.B.I., according to court statements. The details of the 2012 episode have, until now, been kept largely a secret in closed sessions of a federal court in New York and heavily redacted documents. While the documents do not indicate whether the F.B.I. directly ordered the attacks, they suggest that the government may have used hackers to gather intelligence overseas even as investigators were trying to dismantle hacking groups like Anonymous and send computer activists away for lengthy prison terms.  The attacks were coordinated by Hector Xavier Monsegur, who used the Internet alias Sabu and became a prominent hacker within Anonymous for a string of attacks on high-profile targets, including PayPal and MasterCard. By early 2012, Mr. Monsegur of New York had been arrested by the F.B.I. and had already spent months working to help the bureau identify other members of Anonymous, according to previously disclosed court papers. One of them was Jeremy Hammond, then 27, who, like Mr. Monsegur, had joined a splinter hacking group from Anonymous called Antisec. The two men had worked together in December 2011 to sabotage the computer servers of Stratfor Global Intelligence, a private intelligence firm based in Austin, Tex. Shortly after the Stratfor incident, Mr. Monsegur, 30, began supplying Mr. Hammond with lists of foreign websites that might be vulnerable to sabotage, according to Mr. Hammond, in an interview, and chat logs between the two men. The New York Times petitioned the court last year to have those documents unredacted, and they were submitted to the court last week with some of the redactions removed. ''After Stratfor, it was pretty much out of control in terms of targets we had access to,'' Mr. Hammond said during an interview this month at a federal prison in Kentucky, where he is serving a 10-year sentence after pleading guilty to the Stratfor operation and other computer attacks inside the United States. He has not been charged with any crimes in connection with the hacks against foreign countries. Mr. Hammond would not disclose the specific foreign government websites that he said Mr. Monsegur had asked him to attack, one of the terms of a protective order imposed by the judge. The names of the targeted countries are also redacted from court documents. But according to an uncensored version of a court statement by Mr. Hammond, leaked online the day of his sentencing in November, the target list was extensive and included more than 2,000 Internet domains. The document said Mr. Monsegur had directed Mr. Hammond to hack government websites in Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkey and Brazil and other government sites, like those of the Polish Embassy in Britain and the Ministry of Electricity in Iraq. An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment, as did lawyers for Mr. Monsegur and Mr. Hammond. The hacking campaign appears to offer further evidence that the American government has exploited major flaws in Internet security -- so-called zero-day vulnerabilities like the recent Heartbleed bug -- for intelligence purposes. Recently, the Obama administration decided it would be more forthcoming in revealing the flaws to industry, rather than stockpiling them until the day they are useful for surveillance or cyberattacks. But it carved a broad exception for national security and law enforcement operations. Mr. Hammond, in the interview, said he and Mr. Monsegur had become aware of a vulnerability in a web-hosting software called Plesk that allowed backdoor access to thousands of websites. Another hacker alerted Mr. Hammond to the flaw, which allowed Mr. Hammond to gain access to computer servers without needing a user name or password. Over several weeks in early 2012, according to the chat logs, Mr. Monsegur gave Mr. Hammond new foreign sites to penetrate. During a Jan. 23 conversation, Mr. Monsegur told Mr. Hammond he was in search of ''new juicy targets,'' the chat logs show. Once the websites were penetrated, according to Mr. Hammond, emails and databases were extracted and uploaded to a computer server controlled by Mr. Monsegur. The sentencing statement also said that Mr. Monsegur directed other hackers to give him extensive amounts of data from Syrian government websites, including banks and ministries of the government of President Bashar al-Assad. ''The F.B.I. took advantage of hackers who wanted to help support the Syrian people against the Assad regime, who instead unwittingly provided the U.S. government access to Syrian systems,'' the statement said. The court documents also refer to Mr. Monsegur's giving targets to a Brazilian hacker. The hacker, who uses the alias Havittaja, has posted online some of his chats with Mr. Monsegur in which he was asked to attack Brazilian government websites. One expert said that the court documents in the Hammond case were striking because they offered the most evidence to date that the F.B.I. might have been using hackers to feed information to other American intelligence agencies. ''It's not only hypocritical but troubling if indeed the F.B.I. is loaning its sting operations out to other three-letter agencies,'' said Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University and author of a forthcoming book about Anonymous. During the prison interview, Mr. Hammond said that he did not have success hacking a large number of the Plesk websites that Mr. Monsegur had identified, and that his ability to create a so-called back door to a site depended on which operating system it ran on. He added that Mr. Monsegur never carried out the hacks himself, but repeatedly asked Mr. Hammond for specific details about the Plesk vulnerability. ''Sabu wasn't getting his hands dirty,'' he said. Federal investigators arrested Mr. Monsegur in mid-2011, and his cooperation with the F.B.I. against members of Anonymous appears to have begun soon after. In a closed hearing in August 2011, a federal prosecutor told a judge that Mr. Monsegur had been ''cooperating with the government proactively'' and had ''literally worked around the clock with federal agents'' to provide information about other hackers, whom he described as ''targets of national and international interests.'' ''During this time the defendant has been closely monitored by the government,'' said the prosecutor, James Pastore, according to a transcript of the hearing. ''We have installed software on a computer that tracks his online activity. There is also video surveillance in the defendant's residence.'' Mr. Monsegur's sentencing hearing has been repeatedly delayed, leading to speculation that he is still working as a government informant. His current location is unknown. Exactly what role the F.B.I. played behind the scenes during the 2012 attacks is unclear. Mr. Hammond said he had been in constant contact with Mr. Monsegur through encrypted Internet chats. The two men often communicated using Jabber, a messaging platform popular among hackers. Mr. Monsegur used the alias Leondavidson and Mr. Hammond used Yohoho, according to the court records. During a conversation on Feb. 15, 2012, Mr. Hammond said he hoped all the stolen information would be put ''to good use.'' ''Trust me,'' Mr. Monsegur said, according to the chat logs. ''Everything I do serves a purpose.'' Now, sitting in prison, Mr. Hammond wonders if F.B.I. agents might also have been on the other end of the communications. "
Delay Tests Video Game Developer,"MONTREAL -- Imagine living an all-consuming existence as a supremely intelligent yet vengeful, tormented computer hacker who is armed with the technology to control nearly anything and anyone. In a bustling former textile mill here, where the French video game studio Ubisoft has its North American headquarters, designers staring into large computer monitors have been trying to bring that vision to life through the new video game Watch Dogs. The stakes are as high as they come in this industry: The game, set for release on Tuesday, represents more than five years of development by hundreds of workers at an estimated cost of at least $150 million. Ubisoft, which also publishes the popular Assassin's Creed series, seeks to create a tent pole akin to summer blockbuster movies that spawn lucrative sequels. It was supposed to release Watch Dogs last November, when the Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One consoles were introduced, but the game was delayed for work on the software and storytelling.  The game's creative director, Jonathan Morin, was among those who reported the news to Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft's chief executive in Paris. ''He played the game and understood,'' Mr. Morin said recently. ''But he also had to tell investors that we needed more time.'' The company's stock price tumbled more than 26 percent. John Taylor, a longtime video game analyst for the Arcadia Investment Corporation who provided the budget estimate for Watch Dogs, suggested that the postponed release should not hurt sales. That's because hungry game console owners, he said, are ''starved for new content.'' (The stock price has since recovered.) Watch Dogs features a troubled antihero named Aiden Pearce, a Belfast immigrant bent on avenging the murder of his young niece when he coincidentally uncovers the Big Brother-like Blume Corporation. As a castigator of violence in the name of justice, Pearce takes the player on 50 missions through Chicago's autumn streets, back alleys and a decrepit housing project. A life-size poster of this conflicted protagonist looms on a conference room wall at Ubisoft. Pearce is clad in a trench coat, a baseball cap and a scarf that cover all but his menacing, judgmental eyes. While his obscured visage is meant to frighten, it also makes him seem somehow paranoid. There's reason for that: Watch Dogs allows the player to hack into cellphones, A.T.M.s, drawbridges, even helicopters. Through cameras in laptops and televisions, players can peer into someone's fictional files and bedroom, to wholly envelop the lives of others. The game's primary goals are to track down the killers of Aiden's niece and halt the potential evil of the all-seeing corporation. That much is apparent after several recent interviews with Ubisoft staff members and an exclusive two-hour peek at the game. Mr. Morin said the lost time and money caused by the delayed release would be worth it. ''If you do everything in the game,'' he said, ''you'll have spent over 100 hours in our world.'' Players will be asked to understand the motivation of those involved in technology, from a tattoo artist hacker to the sketchy Blume Corporation, which places security cameras on the street and collects everyone's information. Every individual on the street is hackable, and each has been created to have a distinctive personality that reacts to your presence. A multiplayer mode will let another player drop into your game at any time, sneak up on you and steal what you've worked so hard to hack. Danny Belanger, the game's lead designer, described the past few months as ''a tense time'' at Ubisoft. The designers had worked on ''hundreds of things'' to get the game ready, Mr. Belanger said, from fixing bugs to streamlining missions. Numerous games have involved digital revelry and detective work through the years, from Activision's Hacker in 1985 to Quadrilateral Cowboy, a coming independent game. But beyond the looming technology and nonplayable characters with artificial intelligence in Watch Dogs, Ubisoft sought to create an expansive, realistic world for that action. Chicago was considered a compelling setting because of its big, drivable roads -- essential to a modern day open-world game -- and its history. Players will hear music by Chicagoans, including the Smashing Pumpkins, the nasally punk rockers the Vindictives and the blues legend Elmore James. They will also discover landmarks like the gruesome locations of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and the laboratory of the serial killer H. H. Holmes. The observant gamer will see the autumn wind blow desiccated maple leaves around the streets as the Willis Tower gleams in the distance. Then, as the weather turns, and driving rain soaks Pearce's trench coat, the player will find that many cameras must be linked in a certain order to hack a system that manages transportation, utilities and the like. Some puzzles were put on the clock, to add a kind of panic-ridden excitement -- and difficulty. And later, the player must use a big gun to deal with armed guards and steal a car to get around. That treads into territory dominated by Rockstar Games and its Grand Theft Auto franchise. While what's on screen in Watch Dogs is full of strategizing, storytelling and blood-drenched action, Mr. Morin likened playing to being enthralled by a painting. ''I sometimes feel more interactivity in a static painting, interpreting it the way I want based on my own life,'' he said. ''When you finish the game, you're a bit like that guy in the gallery. Your life experience merges with your experience in the game.'' Mr. Morin said he would like those players ''to have one of those after-cinema beer discussions.'' But he doesn't want them to talk about technology's supremacy over society as much as the effect Watch Dogs had on their ethical and moral codes. ''A great game should remind people that they are human beings,'' he said, ''not just players.'' "
Taking a Naked Selfie? Your Phone Should Step In to Protect You,"What should smartphone makers do about nude selfies? Should they encourage us all to point our phones away from our unclothed bodies - or should they instead decide that naked selfies are inevitable, and add features to their products that reduce the chance that these photos could get hacked? Don't scoff. In the wake of the release of several female celebrities' nude images, it's time that the tech industry begin taking the naked-photo security problem seriously. People carry smartphones with them wherever they go. People are also frequently found without clothing. Sure, some may counsel against the commingling these two states of nature, and sure, some people comply. But preaching abstinence isn't working.  Instead, we should try harm reduction: Phone makers should build their products with the expectation that lots of us will take indelicate photos of ourselves and our loved ones. When we do so, our phones should step in with options for protecting such photos, and should apply extra scrutiny when the people who are snapping them are underage. There's a strong case for doing so. Surveys suggest that by the time they finish college, a third of young people have snapped and sent naked photos of themselves to others. There are no surveys of older folks, but I'd imagine that the 25-plus set isn't immune to the charms of the naked selfie, either. See one Anthony Weiner. There's a good security case to be made for protecting the naked selfie. Unless you're guarding government secrets, nude selfies are the most private, secret documents many people posses; if phone makers take care to protect these, they'll be improving their security generally. In some ways, naked selfies are more valuable than money - if your bank or credit card gets hacked, insurance will most likely  make you whole, but if your private photo gets out, you're hosed. There are serious legal ramifications to their distribution, too. People who've received and traded sexts from underage teenagers have been charged with possession of child pornography. Finally, nude selfies are often created for trading with a trusted individual, but those bonds of trust can be fickle (see ""revenge porn""). So the naked selfie presents a complex security question: Can we create a secure way to send, and later ""unsend,"" secret images? In a column a few weeks ago, I argued that our smartphones aren't as smart as they could be. The nude selfie offers a case in point. It's possible to imagine lots of ways for our phones to better protect pictures of our bodies. Here are some:  Our phones should detect nudity.  When you point your phone at your naked form and snap a shot, it could give you a warning: ""It looks like you've taken a sensitive photo. Would you like to encrypt it and require an extra password to view it?"" or ""It looks like you've taken a private photo. Would you like to exclude it from cloud backups?"" or ""Wow-wee! Are you sure you want to keep that picture?"" This is technically plausible. In recent years, computers have become quite good at recognizing specific features in images, including faces and cats. Recognizing the nude form is a comparatively easy task. Unlike in face recognition, the phone wouldn't have tell the difference between one form and another, but instead would simply have to detect the presence of certain physical features. By simply measuring color ranges found in images, some algorithms claim to be able to detect nudity with an accuracy of better than 90 percent. Is it creepy that your phone is scanning your images for your private parts? Sure, somewhat. Smartphone makers could make nude-detection an option rather than the default. But would you rather have your phone look at your picture than everyone online?  Add parental protection.  The nudity-detection algorithm could be tied with the phone's parental guidance system, allowing parents to prevent their children's phones from taking any nude photos. If a teenager tries to take a risqué photo on a phone that's been protected by her folks, the device might say, ""I can't let you save this photo without running it by your parents. Would you like me to text Mom and Dad for permission?""  Add a security trail.  One theory for the towering popularity of Snapchat, the picture-message app, is that it abeds sexting. The app is used to send disappearing messages; a recipient sees your image for a few seconds, and then it's gone. That sounds like a great way to send racy photos, except for one problem: Snapchat's security features are easy to get around. But what if we had a more secure Snapchat-like picture system, one that was built by phone makers that could tap into some of the security features built into our devices' operating systems? For instance, imagine photos that take advantage of Apple's Touch ID fingerprint scanner. I'd send you an image that is viewable only on your phone and only while you have your finger on the Touch ID scanner. You wouldn't be able to save or copy the image, just view it. And you wouldn't be able to view it forever. Once I revoke your rights, the picture would no longer work for you. This protection plan is a version of digital rights management, the kind of copy restriction system that Hollywood uses to protect online movies. Those systems are far from perfect, and the features I outline here, too, won't be impenetrable. An enterprising hacker may well be able to get around one or any of these security measures through a variety of techniques. But these features would make hackers' jobs tougher, and they may protect large numbers of photos that would otherwise leak. What's more, the nude-detection, nude-protection system that I'm outlining would get phone manufacturers in the game of protecting our most secret documents. Naked selfies aren't going away. But if phone companies began thinking more creatively about security, we might not have to be so worried about them.                       "
Dial and Redial: Phone Hackers Stealing Billions,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Bob Foreman's architecture firm ran up a $166,000 phone bill in a single weekend last March. But neither Mr. Foreman nor anyone else at his seven-person company was in the office at the time. ''I thought: 'This is crazy. It must be a mistake,' '' Mr. Foreman said. It wasn't. Hackers had broken into the phone network of the company, Foreman Seeley Fountain Architecture, and routed $166,000 worth of calls from the firm to premium-rate telephone numbers in Gambia, Somalia and the Maldives. It would have taken 34 years for the firm to run up those charges legitimately, based on its typical phone bill, according to a complaint it filed with the Federal Communications Commission. The firm, in Norcross, Ga., was the victim of an age-old fraud that has found new life now that most corporate phone lines run over the Internet.  The swindle, which on the web is easier to pull off and more profitable, affects mostly small businesses and cost victims $4.73 billion globally last year. That is up nearly $1 billion from 2011, according to the Communications Fraud Control Association, an industry group financed by carriers and law-enforcement agencies to tackle communications fraud. Major carriers have sophisticated fraud systems in place to catch hackers before they run up false six-figure charges, and they can afford to credit customers for millions of fraudulent charges every year. But small businesses often use local carriers, which lack such antifraud systems. And some of those carriers are leaving customers to foot the bill. The law is not much help, because no regulations require carriers to reimburse customers for fraud the way credit card companies must. Lawmakers have taken the issue up from time to time, but little progress has been made. Last year, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, pushed the Federal Communications Commission to adopt new regulations after dozens of small businesses around Albany were hit with the swindle. But the agency has not taken any action, and the cause appears to have petered out. Representatives for the agency and the senator's office did not return requests for comment. The scheme works this way, telecommunications fraud experts say: Hackers sign up to lease premium-rate phone numbers, often used for sexual-chat or psychic lines, from one of dozens of web-based services that charge dialers over $1 a minute and give the lessee a cut. In the United States, premium-rate numbers are easily identified by 1-900 prefixes, and callers are informed they will be charged higher rates. But elsewhere, like in Latvia and Estonia, they can be trickier to spot. The payout to the lessees can be as high as 24 cents for every minute spent on the phone. Hackers then break into a business's phone system and make calls through it to their premium number, typically over a weekend, when nobody is there to notice. With high-speed computers, they can make hundreds of calls simultaneously, forwarding as many as 220 minutes' worth of phone calls a minute to the pay line. The hacker gets a cut of the charges, typically delivered through a Western Union, MoneyGram or wire transfer. In part because the plan is so profitable, premium rate number resellers are multiplying rapidly. There were 17 in 2009; last year there were 85, according to Yates Fraud Consulting, which is based in Britain. In 2012, hackers hijacked the phone lines at 26 small businesses around Albany and ran up phone bills as high as $200,000 per business over the course of a few days. Those businesses that contracted with major carriers received credit that covered much of the fraud, though some ended up paying a few thousand dollars. Those who had signed up with a local carrier, Tech Valley Communications, were not so lucky. Tech Valley sued three of its clients to pay huge bills, according to court filings. Best Cleaners, a dry cleaning chain that operates in three states, was one victim. At that business, hackers placed more than 75,000 minutes of premium calls, totaling $147,000. At American Energy Care, a small consulting firm in Albany, the bill reached $200,353. A billboard advertising business in Cohoes, N.Y., was charged $18,000. All settled their cases with Tech Valley. None would discuss the case because of the terms of the settlement, but Best Cleaners said the cost was enough to force it to cancel a planned expansion. Industry groups are trying to tackle the problem but say it is hard to keep up with. Roberta Aronoff, the executive director of the Communications Fraud Control Association, said she routinely loads fake ''hot numbers'' into a fraud management system, sharing them with carriers so they can be blocked. Catching the criminals is difficult because the crime can cross as many as three jurisdictions. In 2011, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and police in the Philippines arrested four men who used the scheme to make $2 million in fraudulent calls; revenue was directed to a Saudi Arabian militant group that United States officials believe financed the 2008 Mumbai terrorist bombings. Foreman Seeley Fountain, the architecture firm, is disputing its $166,000 bill with its carrier, TW Telecom. The bill now includes $17,000 in late charges and termination fees. In addition to asking the F.C.C., the firm has asked the local police, officials at the Georgia Public Service Commission, the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice for help. The F.C.C. and Justice Department declined to comment for this article, and the Georgia agency did not return requests for comment. The local police said there had been no progress in finding the hackers. Joshua Campbell, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said the bureau was working with the industry to solve the problems but declined to discuss the specific case. Bob Meldrum, vice president for corporate communications at TW Telecom, said Foreman Seeley Fountain should have better protected its equipment from hackers. ''We had to pay for those calls,'' he said. ''Someone had to pay for those calls.'' Mr. Foreman said his firm didn't even realize this was a potential risk. Not many do. ''It's relentless,'' said Jim Dalton, founder of TransNexus, which sells Internet calling management software. ''If you put a computer on the Internet, it immediately starts getting probed for a weak point.'' To avoid the same fate, Mr. Dalton and other telecom experts advise people to turn off call forwarding and set up strong passwords for their voice mail systems and for placing international calls. He also said businesses needed to treat their phones as Internet-connected machines, since criminals already were doing that. ''People don't realize their phone is a six-figure liability waiting to happen,'' Mr. Dalton added. "
Who Made That? (Captcha),"Before the presidential election in 1996, a computer company called Digital Equipment Corporation set up a website for opinion polls. There was one problem, though: Partisan hackers could use bots to fill the site with useless spam. So D.E.C. put a pixelated image of the U.S. flag at a random spot on the screen that users had to click before they registered their votes. The flag didn't work too well -- simple programs could be written to defeat it -- but the basic idea would soon be copied and expanded. In September of that year, Moni Naor, a computer scientist at Israel's Weizmann Institute, decided that what was needed was something like a Turing test -- in which a human tries to figure out if he's talking to a computer -- but in reverse. A computer would have to figure out if it was talking to a human, using a test that would be easy for people to pass but impossible for machines. What sort of test might work? Naor's suggestions didn't seem so practical: A user might be shown a portrait, he said, and asked to name its subject's sex. Or he might be presented with an image of several people and told to find the one who wasn't wearing any clothes.  A team of scientists at D.E.C., led by Andrei Broder, soon devised a better solution. They put a string of characters on the screen, masked with gridded lines or other noise, and then asked the user to type the characters in a space below. ''Broder's system was pretty breakable by anyone who knew a little bit about machine vision,'' says John Langford, a Microsoft researcher, referring to the field of study that brought us digitized books. ''But it was enough to deter people.'' A few years later, a cryptographer at Carnegie Mellon, Manuel Blum, perfected the idea. With the help of several graduate students, including Langford and Luis von Ahn, Blum set up the first effective system for screening out spam bots: strings of letters and numbers that were distorted using simple software, random numbers and a standard set of rules. ''The program was completely public,'' Blum says. ''Except for those random numbers, everyone would know exactly how the program worked.'' What about the name Captcha? That was Blum's idea. ''I remember trying to come up with a 'gotcha'-like acronym.'' The best he could manage was: Completely Automated Public Turing test for telling Computers and Humans Apart. Another researcher working on the same topic wanted to call the system a Reverse Turing test. But when Yahoo started using the Carnegie Mellon system, the company described it as a Captcha, and the name stuck. CAPTCHA OF THE MIND Thomas Hannagan is a cognitive scientist at the French National Center for Scientific Research and Aix-Marseille University. Why is a cognitive scientist studying Captcha? These images tell us something about visual word recognition. We've been working on how humans recognize words for more than 100 years, but we still can't fix that system when it's broken. You showed distorted words to subjects for fractions of a second. What did that tell you? A very rapid mechanism abstracts information from the letters. It's not dependent on what color it was or the shape of the letters. Do you have more Captcha experiments in mind? In our lab, people have been working with baboons. They have almost the same visual system as ours, but without any language. If a baboon could process a Captcha, it would tell us that this ability comes, not from language, but from the visual system. You don't really think a baboon could solve a Captcha? That's my next experiment! "
"Thought Safe, Websites Find the Door Ajar","Updated, 10:24 p.m. | A flaw has been discovered in one of the Internet's key security methods, potentially forcing a wide swath of websites to make changes to protect the security of consumers. The problem was first discovered by a team of Finnish security experts and researchers at Google last week and disclosed on Monday. By Tuesday afternoon, a number of large websites, including Yahoo, Facebook, Google and Amazon Web Services, said they were fixing the problem or had already fixed it. Researchers were still looking at the impact on consumers but warned it could be significant. Users' most sensitive information -- passwords, stored files, bank details, even Social Security numbers -- could be vulnerable because of the flaw.  The most immediate advice from security experts to consumers was to wait or at least be cautious before changing passwords. Changing a password on a site that hasn't been fixed could simply hand the new password over to hackers. Experts recommended that, before making any changes, users check a site for an announcement that it has dealt with the issue. ''This is a good reminder that there are many risks online and it's important to keep a watchful eye around what you're doing, just as you would in the physical world,'' said Zulfikar Ramzan, the chief technology officer of Elastica, a security company. The extent of the vulnerability was unclear. Up to two-thirds of websites rely on the affected technology, called OpenSSL. But some organizations appeared to have had advance notice of the issue and had already fixed the problem by Tuesday afternoon. Many others were still working on restoring security. Because attackers can use the bug to steal information unnoticed, it is unclear how widely the bug has been exploited -- although it has existed for about two years. On Github, a website where developers gather to share code, some were posting ways to use the bug to dump information from servers. The Finnish security researchers, working for Codenomicon, a security company in Saratoga, Calif., and security researchers at Google found the bug in a portion of the OpenSSL protocol -- which encrypts sessions between consumer devices and websites -- called the ''heartbeat'' because it pings messages back and forth. The researchers called the bug ''Heartbleed.'' ''It's a serious bug in that it doesn't leave any trace,'' said David Chartier, chief executive at Codenomicon. ''Bad guys can access the memory on a machine and take encryption keys, usernames, passwords, valuable intellectual property, and there's no trace they've been there.'' Organizations were advised to download immediately the newest version of the OpenSSL protocol, which includes a fix, and quickly swap out their encryption keys. It also meant organizations needed to change their corporate passwords, log out users and advise them to change their own passwords. Then companies began taking inventory of what they may have lost. But because the flaw would allow attackers to surreptitiously steal the keys that protect communication, user passwords and anything stored in the memory of a vulnerable web server, it was virtually impossible to assess whether damage had been done. Security researchers say they found evidence that suggests attackers were aware of the bug. Researchers monitoring various ''honey pots'' -- stashes of fake data on the web aimed at luring hackers so researchers can learn more about their tools and techniques -- found evidence that attackers had used the Heartbleed bug to access the fake data. Actual victims may be out of luck. ''Unless an attacker blackmails you, or publishes your information online, or steals a trade secret and uses it, you won't know if you've been compromised,'' Mr. Chartier said. ''That's what makes it so vicious.'' Mr. Chartier advised users to consider their passwords compromised and urged companies to deal with the issue quickly. ''Companies need to get new encryption keys and users need to get new passwords,'' he said. Security researchers say it is most important for people to change passwords to sensitive accounts like their online banking, email, file storage and e-commerce accounts, after first making sure that the website involved has addressed the security gap. By Tuesday afternoon, many organizations were heeding the warning. Companies across the web, including Yahoo, Amazon and PayPal, began notifying users of the bug and what was being done to mitigate it. Tumblr, the social network owned by Yahoo, said it had issued fixes and warned users to immediately swap out their passwords. ''This still means that the little lock icon (HTTPS) we all trusted to keep our passwords, personal emails and credit cards safe was actually making all that private information accessible to anyone who knew about the exploit,'' the security team at Tumblr, which is part of Yahoo, wrote on its site. ''This might be a good day to call in sick and take some time to change your passwords everywhere -- especially your high-security services like email, file storage and banking, which may have been compromised by this bug.'' Steve Lohr and Vindu Goel contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
When Identity Theft Hits Home," When I first heard about the extensive Target hack in December, I sighed in mild irritation. Sure, the breach's size and scope was shocking, but these things have become so common I just assumed I'd receive a new card in the mail and that would be the end of it.  It wouldn't be the first time. I'll sometimes mysteriously get a new card in the mail with a note saying it was replaced because of an unnamed security issue. Once, in Barcelona, I discovered my primary card had been frozen because of a security breach at a retailer - that was panic-inducing. Still, the biggest aggravation was logging into all my auto-pay sites like Amazon to update the card number (and memorizing the new one, which I like to do).   I expected a repeat after Target was hacked.  But it was a lot worse. I did get a new credit card in the mail - a replacement for the card I'd used at Target. I also received a letter from Sears, letting me know I'd been rejected for a new store card because of, among other things, ""too many requests for credit."" Then, in the same batch of mail, I opened a letter from Best Buy, which said I'd been turned down for its top-tier store card, but approved for a lower-level version. That is when I started to panic.  I called the fraud department at Best Buy and employees there assured me they had already marked the account as fraudulent. I immediately filed for a security alert with the three big credit bureaus, and I also filed an online police report. (This can sometimes be helpful if you're trying to convince a retailer that fraud is afoot.) Over the next week, while I was out of town, I also received a store card from Kohl's, one from Frye's electronics and the one from Best Buy.  More worryingly, I also got a bill from a Macy's store card account in my name, for $1,114.39. Apparently I bought $1,223 worth of ""fine watches"" at a Macy's in Glendale, Ariz., but I received a discount of $109 for opening the account. Sounds like a pretty nice watch (or three).  Now, I'm not certain this sudden outbreak of identity theft is directly tied to the breach at Target, but the timing is suspect. I signed up for the credit and identity theft protection service that Target is offering, and after a few hops through low-level support, I was assigned a case number and a fraud resolution agent who will apparently call all these creditors on my behalf and conference me in.   The service promises to close the fraudulent accounts and get the credit requests and the accounts off my record.  I hope that is true. But even if the mess is easily cleared up, this is almost certainly not the last time such a thing will happen, especially now that my credit-worthy identity is up for sale out in the world. Make no mistake: yours probably is, too.  In December, the security researcher Brian Krebs identified a Ukrainian man who may be helping sell credit and debit card numbers for up to $100 each - all the more reason to simply cancel any debit card that was implicated in a security breach instead of waiting and hoping for the best. Card numbers are bundled in bunches and sold for pennies to criminals who simply go down the line, trying numbers until they work.  Those are just the card numbers; plenty more than that is for sale. A GigaOm post in August quoted security researchers who said thieves could spend $4 to $5 for a complete ID package that included a credit card number, its expiration date, your social security number, and your mother's maiden name. That is almost everything you need to walk into a Macy's and open up a store card and have a fun afternoon in the fine watches department.  Financial institutions have become better at identifying fraud and stopping major damage before it occurs, but large-scale security breaches are becoming more common all the time. Target's hackers roamed around the databases for a month before they were detected, stealing personal information, card numbers and even encrypted PIN data. The current tally of affected customers is up to 110 million users.  And just since Target's very bad month, Neiman Marcus has confirmed that its records were also breached, possibly by the same malware, and it has lost at least 1.1 million records (that apparently went undetected from July to December). The arts and crafts chain Michaels was also hit. Yahoo was compromised. Bright Horizons childcare suffered an intrusion, and White Lodging, which manages some 168 Starwood, Marriott, and Hilton hotels in 21 states, is also investigating what is almost certain to be a large-scale hoovering of personal data.  One can assume those are just a few of the breaches happening at any given time. Target is paying for full-scale credit monitoring for 110 million people, Citibank is issuing new debit cards to to all customers, and millions of people like me are wasting valuable time on the phone trying to sort out messes.  I, for one, hope this is a tipping point in retail security. In the meantime, if you'll excuse me, I've got some mopping up to do.   "
"Sony Emails, Free Speech - and Trying a Little 'F2F'","Somewhere in academia, an enterprising law professor is putting together a lecture on the hacked Sony emails, considering the legal and free-speech issues they raise. This post will be considerably less lofty, but let's take a look at some of the questions, and the strong opinions that have emerged in the past few weeks since the so-called Guardians of Peace, thought to be linked to the North Korean government, made its massive cyberattack on the entertainment conglomerate. First, are the email revelations fair game for journalists? Aaron Sorkin, among others, says no. In an Op-Ed piece in last week's Times, he wrote that news organizations that took the bait were ""morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable."" And a number of Times readers who wrote to me agree.  Laura Brooks of Austin, Texas put it this way: ""Just writing to express dismay that the NYT published some quotes and other material from the hacked Sony emails. This is not only an appalling invasion of privacy it's also incredibly dishonorable and pointless. It serves no serious journalistic purpose whatsoever, as far as I can see, other than spreading malicious gossip."" And Armel Patanian made a sharp distinction between this material and, for example, the information from WikiLeaks or the National Security Agency: ""It should be understood that this isn't a Snowden/Assange issue. Getting info out of the government is different because, arguably, we are the government. It is, in a sense, our info. The Sony hack is different. We are not Sony. Sony is Sony."" Practicing journalists see it differently. Dean Baquet, executive editor of The Times, has said that while this is no Pentagon Papers, some of the material may be valid for Times stories.  A televised report of a Times policy - that it will only use the Sony material if it's been written about elsewhere - caused Dan Gillmor of the University of Arizona to tweet: Somewhat incoherent @nytimes policy on Sony leaks almost invites others to do stories first so the NYT can follow: http://t.co/3uNvGfxmOl - Dan Gillmor (@dangillmor)17 Dec 14 But it turns out that there's more nuance to it than that. Philip B. Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, described editors' thinking as follows: The Sony situation poses difficult questions. We don't condone hacking into private computer systems. We also don't like depriving our readers of information they care about. Editors and reporters at The Times have been following the situation closely and discussing the journalistic issues. Any decisions about whether or how to use any of the information will take into account both the significance of the news and the questions of how the information emerged and who has access to it. In other words, he told me, editors are weighing a range of factors, including newsworthiness.  For example, a recent story about industry groups trying to build cases against Google used some information in the emails, but obtained it, the story said, indirectly - through an ""industry executive."" David McCraw, The Times's newsroom lawyer, told me that he hasn't made, or been asked to make, a legal call on using the emails.  In response to my question about whether he knew of a definitive legal analysis on the press issues raised here, he said in an email, that he hadn't seen one. That may reflect the fact that the case involves the intersection of some complicated legal issues: the broad First Amendment protection of publication, the relative lack of First Amendment protection for news gathering, some open questions from the Supreme Court's Bartnicki decision (which is the one that has most often been cited), various state and federal statutes that protect various kinds of private information, the technological steps actually involved in this download and how those steps may change the legal analysis, etc. Separately, did Sony ""let the terrorists win"" when it pulled ""The Interview"" out of theaters last week? David Carr in The Times and longtime free-speech advocate Ken Paulson in USA Today see the acquiescence as a mistake, with Mr. Paulson making a sharp comparison to the way that booksellers admirably banded together to defend the author Salman Rushdie years ago when his book, ""The Satanic Verses,"" was under fire and his life threatened. Felix Salmon offered a different point on Twitter: Sony had every right to do this. Freedom of speech is a right, not an obligation. - Felix Salmon (@felixsalmon)17 Dec 14 My take: A tiny fraction of this material is newsworthy and deserves the light of day. I would resist making a rule that says, ""We'll never use any of it because we don't like the source."" It's the job of journalists to figure out what's important, and clearly, The Times will have a different standard than, say, the Daily Mail. (""British actor Idris Elba could become the next James Bond, according to leaked Sony emails"" was the start of one recent story there.) I don't accept Mr. Sorkin's judgment that news organizations are corrupt when they use anything from these emails. (And I don't think his West Wing president, Jed Bartlet, would agree with him, either.) How ethical is it to use this hacked material under any circumstances?  There's a strange middle ground here.  True, it's not information vital to citizens about government actions, like some of WikiLeaks. But it's also not chitchat from personal accounts between friends.   It is communication among powerful industry figures, sent on corporate email accounts.  Writing in Slate, Justin Peters argued against Mr. Sorkin: ""The Sony leaks shed light on an industry that affects millions of people worldwide."" For me, the sordid nature of the source requires meeting a higher standard for newsworthiness. Responsible news organizations ought to be very selective and publish only what's clearly in the public interest. (That's undoubtedly going to be an infinitesimal percentage of the whole.) In short, they must use a crazy little thing called news judgment.  Stories about Angelina Jolie being called a ""spoiled brat"" don't clear the bar; two top American entertainment executives making racially tinged jokes, from their corporate email accounts, about the first black president's taste in films? Free speech cuts both ways. They have the right to say it, and maybe the public ought to know they did. Mr. Sorkin's much-discussed swipe at female actors' talent as opposed to their male counterparts? Well, it does speak to ""everyday sexism,"" as the celebrated hashtag has it, but it's not the National Security Agency's misdeeds either.  So, probably not. What if the emails were to reveal serious corporate malfeasance? Justifiable, I think. As for Sony's pulling the film out of theaters, the company made a calculated business decision - and had to consider public safety issues - but it's nevertheless disappointing from a free-speech standpoint. And, as Mr. Carr wrote, acceding to these sorts of threats is a slippery slope. And a final (tangential) thought: For years, I've been paranoid about what I write in an email. Now I've become almost monosyllabic.  This incident certainly makes the case for face-to-face communication - not always possible, but often preferable. No wonder there are so many Internet acronyms for doing just that: F2F (face to face), IRL (in real life), and my favorite, LDL (let's discuss live.) What a concept. "
"Rise in Sales for Neiman, Despite Loss","Neiman Marcus reported a rise in second-quarter sales on Friday, during what was a difficult season for retailers. The company also reported substantial expenses from the sale of the company in the fall.  Neiman's revenue was $1.43 billion during its second quarter, which ended Feb. 1, an increase from the same period last year, when revenue was $1.36 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year were up 2.6 percent, while online sales were up 15.1 percent. Nonetheless, the company posted a loss of $67.95 million. Last year during the second quarter, the company reported profits of $40.4 million. In the fall, the company was sold by one group of private equity investors, led by Warburg Pincus and TPG, to another group of investors, led by Ares Management and a Canadian pension plan. Neiman incurred millions of dollars in costs because of the acquisition, including accelerated vesting of stock options and professional fees. The most recent quarter, which included a heavily promoted holiday season followed by an exceptionally stormy and cold January, has squeezed profits for many retailers. But Neiman had an additional challenge: a cyberattack that breached customer data. The company has said that criminals were able to collect payment card data from its stores between July 16 and Oct. 30, 2013. About 350,000 cards were exposed during that time, and approximately 9,200 cards have since been used fraudulently. (Previously, the company said that 1.1 million cards may have been exposed, but it has since learned that the malicious software did not operate in every store, nor on every day during that period.) Neiman said it incurred $4.1 million in costs from the cyberattack during the quarter, including the cost of credit monitoring for its customers and legal fees. Executives said on Friday that those costs could rise but they could not say how high. Excluding acquisition costs and certain other expenses, Neiman's adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $41.6 million, down from $56.4 million last year. "
Malicious Ebola-Themed Emails Are on the Rise,"The Ebola epidemic has migrated online, where cybercriminals are using the virus to infect more people with malware. Last week, the United States Computer Readiness Team, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, issued an advisory warning users about spam campaigns that used the Ebola virus to bait users into clicking on malicious web links or attachments. This week, Trustwave, a private security and compliance consulting company, discovered several Ebola-themed threats.  One email purporting to be from the World Health Organization included a bogus file that claimed to include Ebola safety tips. Once downloaded, the file dropped a program onto the victim's machine that evaded antivirus defenses. The program can do everything from grab shots off the victim's webcam, record sounds from their computer's microphone, take control of their desktop remotely, modify and upload files and steal passwords. Another Ebola-themed email claims to be from the Mexican government and includes a fake advisory about the status of Ebola in Mexico. The email entices the victim to load the content, which downloads malware onto their machine. Trustwave's security researchers say the bulk of Ebola emails are run-of-the-mill spam that contain links to ads, gaming forums, or pharmaceutical websites. The emails, which contain subject lines like ""You won't believe what Obamacare & Ebola have in common"" and ""First GMO foods, now Ebola. What Obama doesn't want you to know"" are not as malicious as those purporting to be from the World Health Organization or Mexican government, but a nuisance nevertheless.  Cybercriminals have long exploited newsy events to send out malicious email and spam. The United States Computer Readiness Team advises users to be wary of unsolicited links or attachments, turn off features that automatically download email attachments and keep their antivirus settings up to date. ""Unsurprisingly, cybercriminals have continued to piggyback on newsworthy and major events, disasters and outbreaks to lure potential victims and spread their malware,"" Trustwave spokeswoman Abby Ross wrote in an email. ""We are echoing their recommendation of never following unsolicited web links or attachments in email messages, particularly Ebola-themed ones.""                       "
"For Guccifer, Hacking Was Easy. Prison Is Hard.","ARAD, Romania -- He reveled in tormenting members of the Bush family, Colin L. Powell and a host of other prominent Americans, and also in outfoxing the F.B.I. and the Secret Service, foiling their efforts to discover even his nationality, never mind his identity. Early this year, however, the elusive online outlaw known as Guccifer lost his cocky composure and began to panic. He smashed his hard drive and cellphone with an ax. That spasm of precautionary destruction, at his home in Romania's rural Transylvania region, did not help him much -- especially as he left pieces of what would later become evidence scattered in the mud.  Two weeks later, on Jan. 22, a global hunt for the celebrated and mysterious hacker who first revealed self-portraits painted by George W. Bush and plundered a trove of personal emails from politicians, military officers and celebrities finally ended in an early morning raid of his home. ''I was expecting them, but the shock was still very big for me,'' the hacker, now serving a seven-year sentence, said. He spoke in an interview, his first, at the Arad Penitentiary here. ''It is hard to be a hacker, but even harder to erase your tracks.'' In many ways, however, his two-year rampage through the email accounts of rich and powerful Americans showed how easy it can be to go rogue on the Internet and, even when armed with only rudimentary skills, to stay one step ahead of the law, at least for a while. The hacker who signed off as Guccifer (pronounced GUCCI-fer) -- a nom de guerre coined, he said, to combine ''the style of Gucci and the light of Lucifer'' -- turned out to be Marcel-Lehel Lazar, a jobless 43-year-old former taxi driver. He had no expertise in computers, no fancy equipment, only a clunky NEC desktop and a Samsung cellphone, and no special skills beyond what he had picked up on the web. Viorel Badea, the Romanian prosecutor who directed the case, expressed dismay that Mr. Lazar had gotten so far with so little. ''He was not really a hacker but just a smart guy who was very patient and persistent,'' Mr. Badea said. Instead of burrowing into his victims' email accounts using computer worms and other hacking tools, the prosecutor said, Mr. Lazar trawled the web for information about his targets and then simply guessed the right answers to security questions. ''He is just a poor Romanian guy who wanted to be famous,'' said the prosecutor, who leads a cybercrime team in Romania's organized crime unit. It took six months of trial and error for Mr. Lazar to guess the right answers and gain access to the emails of Corina Cretu, a 47-year-old Romanian politician who sent pictures of herself in a bikini and a flirtatious message to Mr. Powell, the former secretary of state. Mr. Powell, who has denied having an affair with Ms. Cretu, had urged her to delete all their messages after he discovered that his own email account had been hacked. Mr. Lazar, who is half-Hungarian, acknowledged that he relied mostly on educated guesswork. He said he had no training in computers, though he did work, briefly, in a computer factory. ''I got fired after two weeks,'' he said. To cover his tracks, he launched most of his raids through a proxy server in Russia. He figured that would hide any fingerprints leading back to Romania, where he already had a police record. That followed a 2011 conviction for hacking into the email accounts of Romanian starlets and other celebrities under the name Micul Fum, or Little Smoke. Mr. Lazar was so confident of his ability to elude detection that, late last year, he started boasting of his exploits to The Smoking Gun, an American website that on Jan. 6 posted a defiant email message in broken English from the still unidentified Guccifer: ''NO I am not concerned, i think i switch the proxies go to play some backgammon on yahoo watch tv, play with my family and daughter.'' A day later, however, Mr. Lazar got a shock when George Maior, the head of Romania's domestic intelligence agency, announced that the authorities would soon catch America's most wanted hacker, a vow that suggested they knew he was in Romania. Mr. Lazar, in his prison interview, said he was also badly shaken by Mr. Maior's description of him as ''Little Guccifer,'' which to him indicated that investigators had linked Guccifer with Little Smoke, the pseudonym he used before his 2011 arrest. Thrown into a panic, he decided it was time to destroy evidence of his hacking and took an ax to his computer and cellphone in his yard in the village of Sambateni, about 11 miles east of Arad, the Transylvanian city where he is now in prison. ''I knew they were coming for me,'' he recalled. ''My sixth sense told me I was surrounded. I was losing control of the situation.'' In reality, the authorities still had little idea who Guccifer was. Mr. Maior, in an interview in Bucharest, the Romanian capital, said he was not aware that Guccifer was the same person as Little Smoke, and had merely called him ''little'' to ''minimize his aura of un-catchability.'' The authorities, Mr. Maior said, did not even know at the time that Guccifer was Romanian. But they had suspected he might be since September, when Guccifer hijacked a personal email account used by Mr. Maior, the security chief, and then used it to send Romanian-language messages to Mr. Maior's official email account at the Romanian Intelligence Service. Mr. Maior promptly ordered an investigation. ''It was clear he had broken into my email,'' Mr. Maior said. ''He wanted to prove something. I took it seriously.'' Aided by American investigators, who had been hunting in vain for Guccifer for months, the Romanians quickly homed in on Mr. Lazar, who had left a clumsy trail of clues. ''He made many mistakes,'' Mr. Badea, the prosecutor, said. Mr. Lazar said he could have covered his tracks better if he had had more money -- for a more powerful computer, for instance. ''Of course, I could have stolen money from them,'' he said, distancing himself from the legions of his countrymen who have made Romania, the second-poorest country in the 28-member European Union, a global leader in Internet fraud. ''I didn't. Not a single dollar.'' An American indictment filed against Mr. Lazar in Virginia in June accused him of trying to extort ''money and property by means of materially false and fraudulent representations, pretenses and promises'' to his American victims, but Romanian investigators say they found no evidence of extortion. Romanian officials say the United States has not asked Romania to extradite Mr. Lazar but has sent investigators to question him to learn how he managed to prey on so many powerful Americans. The United States Justice Department declined to comment. Before agreeing to answer questions from The New York Times in prison, where he shares a cell with four others, including two convicted murderers, he read out a lengthy handwritten statement that he said explained the purpose of his hacking. A potpourri of conspiracy theories about the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the 1997 death of Princess Diana and alleged plans for a nuclear attack in Chicago in 2015, it said: ''This world is run by a group of conspirators called the Council of Illuminati, very rich people, noble families, bankers and industrialists from the 19th and 20th century.'' Mr. Badea, the Romanian prosecutor, scoffed at Mr. Lazar's fixation on so-called Illuminati as a ruse intended to give a political gloss to a peeping-tom hacking addiction. The hacking exploits that led to his 2011 conviction involved ''no Illuminati, just famous and beautiful girls,'' the prosecutor said. Mr. Lazar denied any interest in celebrities, asserting that he had only stumbled on most of the people he hacked as Guccifer, a long list that included the actress Mariel Hemingway, the ''Sex and the City'' author Candace Bushnell, the editor Tina Brown, the comedian Steve Martin, the author Kitty Kelley and many others. With no access to a computer in jail, he now pours out his phobias and conspiracy theories in notebooks filled with his small, neat handwriting. ''O.K., I broke the law, but seven years in a maximum-security prison? I am not a murderer or a thief,'' he said. ''What I did was right, of course.'' "
Sally Beauty Investigating Possible Credit Card Theft,"In what may be the latest cyberattack on an American retailer, Sally Beauty Holdings said Wednesday that it had been investigating a security breach that others say may have resulted in hundreds of thousands of stolen customer credit cards. Sally Beauty Holdings, which had $3.6 billion in revenue last year, sells beauty products to consumers as well as to professionals at places like salons. Sally Beauty Supply, one of its main business units, has 3,300 stores in several countries and operates 2,600 retail stores in the United States. Karen Fugate, a spokeswoman for the company, based in Denton, Tex., said that on Feb. 25, its intrusion detection technology, called TripWire, had identified an intrusion into its systems. In response, Ms. Fugate said, Sally Beauty shut down all incoming communications to the retailer's systems and hired a forensics team from Verizon, which has been investigating recent breaches at Target and other companies.  Verizon is now investigating the breach, but Ms. Fugate said company officials and forensics efforts have yet to tie fraudulent activity on customers' credit cards to the breach. ""We have yet to find any evidence that customers' credit card data has been compromised,"" Ms. Fugate said Wednesday. The Secret Service, which has been conducting an inquiry into recent breaches at Target, Neiman Marcus and others, said it was not investigating a breach at Sally Beauty. The intrusion at Sally Beauty was first reported Wednesday by Brian Krebs, the independent security blogger. Mr. Krebs noted this week that a fresh batch of 282,000 stolen credit and debit cards had gone on sale in an underground crime store. Mr. Krebs said that representatives from affected banks had purchased several stolen credit cards from popular sites where they are sold and discovered that 15 of them were used recently at Sally Beauty. If the breach is confirmed, Sally Beauty will be the fourth major retailer - after Target, Neiman Marcus and Michaels - to confirm that its systems were compromised recently. A report last week from Bloomberg identified Sears as another company that had been breached, but the company and law enforcement officials have denied reports. The tally of customers affected by recent breaches at Neiman Marcus, Target, Michaels and others now exceeds one-third of the American population. In those cases, criminals installed so-called malware on retailers' systems, which fed customers' payment details back to their computer servers. The breaches are believed to have been perpetrated by the same group of criminals in Eastern Europe, and to be part of a broader cyberattack directed at as many as six other retailers, according to two people investigating the breaches who were not authorized to speak publicly. The entry point for each breach differed, according to one law enforcement official. At Target, the entry point is believed to be a Pennsylvania company that provided heating, air conditioning and refrigeration services to Target. Criminals were able to use the company's login credentials to gain access to Target's systems, and eventually to its point-of-sale systems. According to two people briefed on the company's internal investigation, criminals were able to do so because Target's network was ""flat"" - or was not designed in such a way that certain systems required higher levels of authentication. On Wednesday, as Sally Beauty confirmed its compromise and looked into reports of the breach, Target said its chief information officer, Beth Jacob, had resigned.  "
Facebook Generation Rekindles Expectation of Privacy Online,"Mark Zuckerberg said in 2010 that privacy was no longer a ""social norm."" But four years later, the pendulum might be ready to swing the other way. The second generation of digital citizens - teenagers and millennials, who have spent most, if not all, of their lives online - appear to be more likely to embrace the tools of privacy and protect their personal information. Disappearing-message apps like Snapchat and Cyber Dust have been embraced by young people who aren't eager to leave too much of a digital footprint. Video apps like Vine and Instagram let you create an edited version of your world instead of uploading all your personal details.  Even Facebook, despite years of resistance, recently changed its default for new posts from ""public"" to ""friends"" and introduced tools that let you easily untag yourself in other people's photos and change old posts from public to friends-only. ""Previously there had been a sort of undue trust in the magic of cloud services,"" said Justin Brookman, director of the Consumer Privacy Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology. ""People are starting to reconsider that."" ""For some people, the results will be that we don't have any privacy and we should get over that,"" he said. ""But I don't think people want that. We've seen the younger generation search out tools that let them communicate in more private ways."" These tools aren't foolproof, but they speak to an interest in sharing less freely and being more judicious. Devices like the Blackphone also offer expanded tools for protecting your privacy, like encryption of data and more secure app management, that could trickle into mainstream products. And regulatory pressure in the United States and Europe may be forcing companies to think twice about what they do with personal information. ""You're seeing more pressure on companies to be more explicit about what they're doing with your data,"" Mr. Brookman said. ""But a lot of companies would just as soon fly under the radar. Requiring real transparency and real choice would help a lot in these matters."" There may be only so much we can do to protect ourselves against hackers bent on stealing our information, of course, as some celebrities appeared to discover last week. You can create stronger passwords and enable things like multifactor authentication, which adds steps to logging into an online account. Sure, a person wearing Google Glass could be surreptitiously recording your conversations or actions in public. But many losses of online privacy are self-inflicted. That's one reason the phrase ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" has a tortured history on the web. Its origins are in a United States Supreme Court ruling that helped refine the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which protects citizens against unreasonable search and seizure. A 1967 ruling by the court created the concept of the expectation of privacy, but further cases determined that the expectation might not exist for information that you knowingly expose to a third party. That cuts a pretty broad path, it turns out, since it applies to almost any information you give to someone else. And while it used to be assumed that you had a reasonable expectation of privacy in places like your home, privacy on the Internet or anything connected to it has proved difficult to defend. It doesn't help if you willingly share information with other people - and companies - on social media. Your phone may also be tracking your precise location and compiling a complete record of your whereabouts. Although the Supreme Court ruled this year that police can't search a phone without a warrant, the federal government has argued that it doesn't need a warrant to obtain that history from cellular providers, because you can't reasonably expect that information to be private. The ads you click on and your search history paint a picture of what you buy, what interests you and what ails you. Even your email and personal messages may be fair game. Google said in a 2013 court filing that users had no reasonable expectation that their email communications are confidential. That's a windup to say that for young people - and maybe even some of the older ones - there is plenty of data pointing to a need to think twice about their online behavior. Last year around this time, the Pew Research Center reported that 86 percent of Internet users had taken some kind of steps to avoid being identified or tracked online, even though almost 60 percent of them thought that true online anonymity was impossible. They might be right about anonymity, but others might still argue that keeping at least some privacy is worth a shot.                       "
Banning Bitcoin,"LONDON -- The Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group said on Wednesday that it would not allow the sale of Bitcoins on its website. Alibaba becomes the latest in a growing chorus of governments and businesses to raise questions about Bitcoin, which has seen its value rise dramatically as more people embrace virtual currency.  ''In the interest of consumer protection, Taobao Marketplace has banned the listing or sale of Bitcoins over the platform,'' said Florence Shih, an Alibaba spokeswoman. Bitcoin wasn't an accepted form of payment on the website; the vast majority of transactions are processed through Taobao's Alipay system. But some merchants still offered to accept Bitcoin as payments for their products or sold the virtual currency. The ban goes in effect on Jan. 14. The announcement comes as Alibaba is considering an initial public offering as early as this year. Wall Street is anticipating that the Chinese company could be valued at more than $150 billion. Alibaba's decision also follows a move by China last month to ban the nation's banks from accepting Bitcoins as a currency over concerns about potential money laundering and its potential threat to financial stability. In a notice in December, the People's Bank of China and other agencies said that Bitcoin was ''not a currency in the real meaning of the word'' but rather was a ''virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency.'' The notice went on, ''Nor can, or should, it be circulated or used in the marketplace as a currency.'' Bitcoin was created in 2009 and has a limited supply. As a result, the price of those units has increased as investors have bet on a continued growing demand for the virtual currency. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Bitcoin Figure Is Accused of Conspiring to Launder Drug Money,"One of the most prominent players in the Bitcoin universe, Charles Shrem, was arrested by federal authorities on Sunday and accused of helping smooth the way for drug transactions on the now-defunct online bazaar Silk Road. Mr. Shrem was a co-founder and chief executive of a popular website, BitInstant, where Bitcoins could be bought using dollars. At the age of 24, Mr. Shrem was a regular speaker on the Bitcoin convention circuit, and was also on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that educates the public on digital money. The criminal charges unsealed on Monday by the United States attorney's office in Manhattan claim that Mr. Shrem used his company to knowingly convert money into virtual currency for people interested in buying narcotics on the Silk Road site. He was also accused of personally buying drugs on the site. According to the complaint, the scheme was operated in cooperation with another man, Robert Faiella, known as BTCKing, who was arrested on Monday in Florida.  The case is already causing discomfort in Bitcoin circles, where the line between legal and illegal enterprises has long been somewhat blurry, hindering public acceptance of digital money. The price of Bitcoin dropped after the announcement of the arrests on Monday, and was down over 7 percent in the evening to around $810. Even as the popularity of virtual currencies has exploded -- the price of a single Bitcoin is up over 5,000 percent in the last year -- government officials have not yet come up with clear regulation governing the use of virtual currencies under the law. That fact has made it easier for theft and fraud to occur even on legitimate websites. BitInstant appeared to be firmly in the camp of legitimate virtual currency businesses earlier this year. The company won the backing of Winklevoss Capital Management, which is run by the Winklevoss twins, who were early players in Facebook. After the arrests, the Winklevoss brothers put out a statement saying that they ''are obviously deeply concerned about his arrest,'' and ''support any and all governmental efforts to ensure that money-laundering requirements are enforced.'' The brothers also said that they ''look forward to clearer regulation being implemented on the purchase and sale of Bitcoins.'' The issue is likely to come up on Tuesday at the beginning of a two-day hearing on how regulators should deal with Bitcoin, organized by the New York State superintendent of financial services, Benjamin M. Lawsky. The Winklevoss brothers are both scheduled to testify. When the Silk Road website was shut down last year, many Bitcoin fans cheered, arguing that the action was important in stamping out the illegal activity that had thrived in the early days of Bitcoin. Since then, the price of Bitcoin has risen and many mainstream investors have expressed interest in the currency's possibilities. But Mr. Shrem's arrest may again raise questions about the distance between the legal problems in Bitcoin's past and its legitimate financial opportunities. The complaint unsealed on Monday suggested that Mr. Shrem and his business partners were themselves grappling with what was and was not allowed. When a co-founder of BitInstant asked Mr. Shrem why he was working with someone with such clear affiliation with Silk Road, Mr. Shrem wrote in an email in 2012 that, ''he has not broken a law and Silk Road itself is not illegal,'' according to the complaint. Mr. Shrem added, ''We make good profit from him.'' The United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, said in a statement on Monday, ''We will aggressively pursue those who would co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.'' Mr. Shrem and Mr. Faiella were both charged with conspiring to launder money, and Mr. Shrem was also charged with ''willfully failing to file any suspicious activity report'' about Mr. Faiella's work. BitInstant stopped operating last summer for reasons that remain unclear. Customers later filed suit against the company, claiming that the company misrepresented its services, and sought class-action status. But the site was viewed as a pioneer in the industry, and Mr. Shrem recently said that he planned to restart it. Mr. Shrem has also been an outspoken champion of the virtual currency. On the day he was arrested, he was scheduled to be a featured speaker at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami. He was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport. On Monday, Mr. Shrem was still listed as a member of the Bitcoin Foundation's board. ''We are surprised and shocked by the news today,'' a spokeswoman for the foundation, Jinyoung Englund, said. ''As a foundation, we take these allegations seriously and do not condone illegal activity.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
A Swipe at Traditional Banking at a Forum on Bitcoin's Future,"A hearing Tuesday on the regulatory future of Bitcoin instead turned into a forum on the shortcomings of the traditional banking industry. The hearing, called by New York State's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, gave five Bitcoin advocates the chance to discuss what they view as the advantages of Bitcoin over current systems of moving money around the world. ''Solutions don't really come from the current industry,'' said Cameron Winklevoss, who, with his twin brother, Tyler, has invested in Bitcoin companies. The two were early players in Facebook.  Even Mr. Lawsky got in some digs when he complained that it takes three days for his bank to transfer money to pay a credit card bill at the same bank. When Mr. Lawsky asked about efforts by banks to create their own Bitcoin alternatives, Fred Wilson, a leading venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures, doubted that anyone would build software around a currency created by the conventional banking system. ''No one is going to build on top of JPMorgan Chase's Bitcoin,'' he said. JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, last week publicly played down the potential of virtual currencies like Bitcoin, which have become so hot over the last year. Bitcoin aficionados argue that digital money could provide a way to dispense with the transaction fees and penalties charged by banks. The hearing underscored just how ambitious Bitcoin advocates are in their desire to create a new payment system. For his part, Mr. Lawsky showed openness to regulations that would encourage the new technology. ''We need to think internally about how we can be a more modern, digital regulator,'' he said. Mr. Lawsky has proposed the creation of a BitLicense for virtual currency firms, but the concept barely came up on Tuesday. Regulators have so far been reluctant to come up with specific rules for virtual currencies or even to specify who should be supervising them. Mr. Lawsky indicated on Tuesday that he hoped to make New York the first state to provide regulatory clarity. The panel Tuesday morning was the first of five in a two-day hearing, and testimony Wednesday may provide a more critical look at Bitcoin. But even Tuesday morning's panel was not entirely friendly. The panelists suggested they were suspicious of any regulations that would force virtual currency start-ups to follow the same money-laundering laws imposed on traditional banks. ''If that's the condition of a company starting, than maybe we don't do it in the United States,'' said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, a firm that invests in Bitcoin companies. But Mr. Lawsky and his colleagues said that the industry was going to need to find a way to operate under the same laws as other financial firms. ''If the choice for regulators is to permit money-laundering on the one hand, or to permit innovation on the other, we are always going to choose squelching the money-laundering first,'' he said. Hanging over the hearing was the criminal complaint unsealed on Monday against a leading Bitcoin entrepreneur, Charles Shrem, and a business partner, who were accused of helping people buy drugs online using virtual currencies. During the hearing, the Bitcoin Foundation, where Mr. Shrem was vice chairman, put out a statement indicating that Mr. Shrem had resigned on Tuesday. Mr. Lawsky said the arrests showed the potential that virtual currencies have to smooth the way for illegal activity. But the people testifying said that Mr. Shrem's arrest showed that current laws are enough to stop wrongdoing in the Bitcoin universe, particularly because all transactions are recorded on a public ledger. In the end, the panelists did much more than defend Bitcoin -- they spoke about it as an almost messianic force for good in the world. ''It's about freedom, ultimately, and whether you want to live in a society that embraces innovation and free speech and freedom or not,'' Mr. Wilson said. A minute later, Tyler Winklevoss echoed that: ''Back to what Fred said: Bitcoin is freedom. It's very American.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Legal Problems Barely Subdue a Bitcoin Evangelist's Fervor,"A few weeks before his arrest at Kennedy Airport, Charles Shrem was standing behind the Manhattan bar he invested in with some of his Bitcoin fortune, buzzing about his big plans for the virtual currency and himself. With the frenetic pace of a sports announcer, Mr. Shrem, the co-founder of a popular website where Bitcoins could be bought using dollars, jumped between his idea for a Bitcoin debit card; his recent conversations with the owners of a private jet company who wanted to take payment in Bitcoin; his goal of unifying the country's money transfer laws; and his travel plans to just about every corner of the world, including the trip to Amsterdam he was returning from when he was arrested last week. ''Bitcoin really allows you to have such a global life -- it allows you to be able to move anywhere within days if you want to,'' the scruffily bearded Mr. Shrem said, standing in front of the sign announcing that the bar, EVR, would accept Bitcoin. These days, though, Mr. Shrem's exploits in Bitcoin have him restricted to his parents' home in Brooklyn, where he awaits trial on federal charges that he smoothed the way for drug transactions online. Mr. Shrem was also accused of buying marijuana himself. He has pleaded not guilty.  The 24-year-old Mr. Shrem, who went through millions of dollars' worth of Bitcoin over the years, is not the first person in the virtual currency world to end up in handcuffs, but he is the most central player to face charges. His recent reversal of fortune -- and the meteoric ascent that led up to it -- makes him a living symbol of the peaks and valleys that have so far defined the Bitcoin experience, as the value of all the outstanding coins has shot above $10 billion. The virtual currency -- digital money that can be traded between online wallets using virtual keys -- has given rise to world-changing ambitions, new-money fortunes and global jet-setting. But all the high living has often seemed just a hairbreadth away from a police raid or government crackdown. In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Shrem said that, particularly during the early days of Bitcoin, it often was not clear what was right and wrong. ''You had so many bad things going on, and so little good, that you had to dive down into it to bring it up,'' he said. For his own part, he acknowledged, ''back then I wasn't as educated on what was legal and what was not legal.'' The uncertainty stems, in no small part, from the lack of clarity about what laws apply to Bitcoin transactions -- and the relative lack of interest from law enforcement. But in addition to that uncertainty, Bitcoin's troubles have arisen from its tendency to attract maverick characters who want to test the established order. Before his arrest, Mr. Shrem talked about his difficulties with traditional banks. ''I don't actually have a bank account,'' he said with an impish grin that he has flashed during many speaking engagements. ''No real bank would bank me.'' Jerry Brito, a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said that Mr. Shrem was ''quite a compelling story -- a sort of rags-to-riches story, made possible through Bitcoin.'' But, Mr. Brito said, many of the early entrepreneurs may not have had the proper tools for the world they were entering. ''These people were not ready for what they found themselves in the middle of,'' Mr. Brito said. Since Mr. Shrem's arrest, some of the top figures in the Bitcoin world have distanced themselves from his activities. The Bitcoin Foundation, where Mr. Shrem was vice chairman, said in a statement after he resigned that it was ''worth noting that the indictment itself is not against Bitcoin or the community at large.'' But a few have come to his support. Roger Ver, an early investor in Mr. Shrem's company, said that Mr. Shrem was a ''trustworthy person, who would never commit a crime in which there is a victim.'' Nearly everyone who knows Mr. Shrem agrees that he was a charismatic salesman for Bitcoin from almost the first moment he encountered the digital money. Mr. Shrem has said that he began dabbling in Bitcoin during his final year at Brooklyn College in 2011. He had grown up in Brooklyn, graduated from Yeshiva of Flatbush, a private Jewish school, and founded a start-up during his first years in college. But Bitcoin quickly became his passion. ''I became obsessed,'' he told the website MeetInnovators last year. He quickly realized how hard it was to exchange dollars into Bitcoin, and so he helped found his company, BitInstant, with another early adopter he met online. To raise money for BitInstant, Mr. Shrem turned on all his salesman charms, even with his mother. ''I said, 'Mom, I love this idea and I put all my money into it, and we're growing so quickly,' '' he said during an interview last year with the Russian-owned television station RT. ''She wrote me a check that day.'' He used similar powers of persuasion with Mr. Ver and the Winklevoss brothers, of Facebook fame, who helped lead a $1.5 million fund-raising round. The brothers have said since Mr. Shrem's arrest that, ''We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials.'' Mr. Shrem's charisma quickly took him beyond the bounds of his company. He was a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation board. He became a regular speaker at Bitcoin events. And he made an investment, in Bitcoin, in EVR, the bar founded by a few friends, which became a regular site for Bitcoin parties. He lived with the other owners in a five-bedroom apartment above the bar and hung out with his girlfriend, who sometimes worked as a bartender downstairs. A profile of Mr. Shrem last year on the website Vocativ said that in the middle of all this, Mr. Shrem never stopped having fun. According to the article, Mr. Shrem said, ''I won't hire you unless I drink with you or smoke weed with you.'' Mr. Shrem said this week that the comment was taken out of context and was only a joke. But he has never been shy about how widely he ranged in the Bitcoin world. During the recent interview at EVR, he recounted a conversation with a former financial regulator: ''She was like, 'Charlie, you and some of your friends have become such super experts in finance, law and the Patriot Act and all these things.' '' ''And I'm like, 'It's Bitcoin,' '' he said. In the end, it was his basic business that got him in trouble. The indictment on money-laundering charges, filed on Jan. 27, contends that he helped exchange dollars into Bitcoin for people who wanted to buy drugs on the online bazaar Silk Road despite knowing their intent and being warned by his business partner. The charges were surprising given that Mr. Shrem often appeared at Bitcoin events talking about how to trade Bitcoin legally. At a Bitcoin conference last year, he boasted that BitInstant was ''going to be the shining city on the hill.'' ''We're going to be the company that succeeded in the United States,'' he said. ''Worked with governments. Worked with banks. Did compliance.'' At the same time, Mr. Shrem acknowledged that he tested the limits of how much information the government required him to collect from his customers. ''You trust us, we trust you,'' is how he described his company's philosophy at the conference last year. ''A lot of regulators frowned on that with me. But we said, 'It's going to work,' and it has worked so far.'' A few months after that event, BitInstant's bank shut down the company's account suddenly. The company went offline soon after that and faced a lawsuit from customers who said the company had misrepresented its services, and sought class-action status. But that had not put a crimp in his big plans. Last month, his goal was to reopen BitInstant in the first quarter of this year after more fund-raising. After the arrest, he is not supposed to deal in Bitcoin, but his big ambitions for the currency, and himself, have not faded. ''Given the opportunity, I will get back on the speaking circuit and be an evangelizer for Bitcoin,'' he said on Thursday. ''At the same time, the more high-profile you are, the more careful you have to be. It's scary.'' "
Some Errors in Software at Exchange for Bitcoins,"What was once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, appeared near collapse on Monday, the latest symbol of the woes facing early players in the world of virtual currencies. Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo, has had a rough ride lately. A few days after cutting off withdrawals for customers, Mt. Gox said on Monday that its problems were a result of a more fundamental flaw in the computer program that underlies Bitcoin. That news touched off a sell-off in virtual currency markets Monday morning, briefly leading to a swoon of more than 20 percent in the price of Bitcoin, to $535. The price recovered somewhat after developers and researchers in the Bitcoin community said the problems were less an indication of flaws in the currency than of bad decisions at Mt. Gox.  ''This just confirms what everyone in the Bitcoin community has known for a while: Don't use Mt. Gox,'' said Sarah Meiklejohn, a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego who studies virtual currencies. Mt. Gox is not the only early leader in the virtual currency world to stumble as Bitcoin has grown more popular. Charles Shrem, a founder of one of the most popular early Bitcoin websites, BitInstant, was arrested in late January and accused of helping people make drug purchases with Bitcoins. Edward W. Felten, a professor at Princeton University who has studied Bitcoin, said, ''We're seeing a shakeout where the companies that are weaker in terms of management and technical execution are being weeded out.'' At the same time, Bitcoin developers did acknowledge that weaknesses remained in the currency's underlying protocol and that more work was needed to ready the currency for widespread use. ''This is a good reminder that Bitcoin is still young and experimental,'' the lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation, Gavin Andresen, said in a statement on Monday. Bitcoin has drawn many fans because it runs according to computer code, and is thus theoretically immune to human error. Some critics, though, have long said that computer code can be susceptible to flaws or manipulation. The problems at Mt. Gox came after what had already been a bad week for Bitcoin, which many believe holds the promise of becoming a faster, cheaper way of moving money around the world. The Russian government announced last Thursday that it would treat virtual currency transactions as illegal. The Prosecutor General's Office in Russia said that ''citizens and legal entities risk being drawn -- even unintentionally -- into illegal activity, including laundering of money obtained through crime, as well as financing terrorism.'' Russia had been one of the places where Bitcoin was growing the fastest. In the United States, officials have generally been cautiously supportive. But on the same day as the Russian announcement, police charged two men in Florida with using Bitcoins to launder money. The recent big movements in the price of Bitcoin seem to be driven largely by the turmoil at Mt. Gox. Last week, a growing number of customers were complaining about their inability to withdraw money from their Mt. Gox accounts. Then on Friday, the company officially stopped any further withdrawals. On Monday, the currency plummeted, trading at about $650 by evening, down from about $850 at the beginning of last week. Founded initially as a place to trade a type of card used in role-playing games, Mt. Gox became a Bitcoin exchange in 2010 and quickly rose to become the most popular place to acquire the virtual currency for government-issued currency. But the company has suffered several setbacks. In 2011, a hacking attack helped precipitate the first crash in the price of Bitcoin. In the years that followed, Mt. Gox had trouble processing customer transactions at times, slowing trade. And last May, United States authorities seized the company's American bank accounts, saying it had not properly registered as a ''money transmitter.'' Since then, Mt. Gox has filed the necessary paperwork and tried to recoup its early success, but many customers have been suspicious. Those using the exchange have complained that it has not been easy to move money in or out. The exchange's market share for dollar transactions has fallen to about 20 percent from more than 80 percent early last year, according to the Genesis Block, a research firm. Still, Mt. Gox's contentions about the Bitcoin code were taken seriously on Monday because they raised basic questions about the soundness of the currency. From the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, one of the most important and vaunted features of its protocol was its ability to prevent the same coins from being moved to two different places at the same time. In its announcement on Monday, Mt. Gox said that a bug in the Bitcoin software made it possible for someone to use the Bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it appear that a Bitcoin transfer had not taken place when, in fact, it had. The company said: ''We have discussed this solution with the Bitcoin core developers and will allow Bitcoin withdrawals again once it has been approved and standardized.'' Other exchanges did not report similar problems, and Mr. Felten of Princeton said that the issue described by Mt. Gox had been known for years and dealt with by other companies through some simple coding changes. ''It does say something about the rough edges of the Bitcoin technology,'' Mr. Felten said. At the same time, he added, ''It's an issue that is likely to be fixed in the longer run, and that can be programmed around.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Liquid-Cooled Computers, to Trim the Power Bill","TOKYO -- Dropping a home computer into a vat of liquid would wreck it. Yet some operators of supercomputers are submerging their machines in liquids, without causing any apparent damage, to keep them from overheating. Advocates say so-called immersion or submersion cooling could solve one of the biggest challenges of the digital economy: reducing the air-conditioning bills and environmental strains of the power-hungry servers and supercomputers that crunch ever-rising mountains of data. A prototype supercomputer at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, which is submerged in a tank of mineral oil, was named in November in an industry ranking, the Green500, as the most energy-efficient machine of its kind. The computer, called Tsubame KFC, is 50 percent more powerful than an older supercomputer at the institute but uses the same amount of energy.  ''The university administration said, 'You're not going to get any more power,'â[#x20ac][0/00]'' said Satoshi Matsuoka, the project leader. ''But we still wanted more performance.'' Japan is driven to reduce electricity consumption since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. The country idled other nuclear facilities across the country, cutting electricity generating capacity sharply. The use of oil or other liquids, rather than air-conditioning, to cool supercomputers and powerful servers is not limited to Japan. The technology used by the Tokyo institute was developed by a company in Austin, Tex., called Green Revolution Cooling. Elsewhere, engineers are experimenting with different liquids to accomplish a similar task. Iceotope, a start-up based in Sheffield, England, submerges computers in liquid fluoroplastic, rather than oil. The company, whose clients include universities in Britain and Poland, in January raised 6 million pounds, or about $10 million, from venture capital investors backed by Schneider Electric, one of the biggest providers of data center cooling technology. In Hong Kong, a company called Allied Control, which designs cooling systems, used submersion technology for a recently opened data center. The facility is operated by Asicminer, a company that works with the virtual currency Bitcoin, solving the algorithms that create the currency. Unlike water, neither mineral oil nor the liquid fluoroplastics used by Iceotope and Allied Control conduct electricity. Therefore, experts say, there is no risk of short-circuiting the equipment or damaging it in other ways. Peter Hopton, chief executive of Iceotope, said data centers that use air-conditioning could cut their energy bills and infrastructure costs in half by using submersive cooling. Not only do facilities that are cooled this way use less electricity, they also eliminate or reduce the need for costly air-conditioning and filtering equipment. ''We're not talking about small numbers here,'' he said. ''We're talking about millions in savings, every year.'' Some supercomputers consume tens of millions of dollars worth of energy annually, while the biggest corporate data centers have electricity bills of hundreds of millions of dollars, much of that going for air-conditioning. Water is already used widely as a coolant in data centers and supercomputers, but usually it is piped through the facilities or the machines. Piping water through a supercomputer or a data center is one thing. Submerging the devices in liquid is another. Cray, the American supercomputer maker, used submersion cooling for one of its machines in the 1980s, earning it the nickname Bubbles. But the method was not widely used, in part because of concern about the high cost and the ozone-depleting effects of the coolants of that era. Iceotope and the Hong Kong system use new kinds of fluids, including one from 3M called Novec 1230. 3M says it is not ozone-depleting and has been exempted from the list of volatile organic compounds issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Hopton said Novec, which he described as ''liquid Teflon,'' provided more cooling power than mineral oil, the fluid used by Green Revolution. Christiaan Best, chief executive of Green Revolution, countered that mineral oil was almost as effective and considerably less expensive. Mineral oil costs less than $10 a gallon, while Novec 1230, which is more commonly used in sophisticated fire extinguishing equipment, costs about $70 a gallon, he said. To test the viability of the new system, the Tokyo institute erected a small building, little more than a shed, to house Tsubame KFC just outside a much larger lab that contains an existing supercomputer. Putting it next to a big heat-producing supercomputer gives the academics a chance to determine whether Tsubame KFC can function even when the oil warms up to summertime temperatures of 95 degrees Fahrenheit. They think it might be possible because modern semiconductors can operate at higher temperatures than their forerunners, Professor Matsuoka said. Only a few modifications were necessary to enable Tsubame KFC to be submerged, he said. Moving parts like hard drives and fans had to be removed, for example. Green Revolution's mineral oil cooling method has already been used at several data centers, including facilities operated by the United States Department of Defense. Intel conducted a one-year study of the system and found that its servers had suffered no adverse effects, and power consumption was cut sharply. Japanese computer experts consider energy efficiency an area in which their country's supercomputer industry, long a source of national pride, can claim a technological lead. Other countries, like China, have rivaled or surpassed it in sheer computing power. At SC13, a conference in Denver where Tsubame KFC was named the greenest supercomputer, a Chinese supercomputer topped a separate list that measured only raw computing power. But that computer uses more than twice as much energy as Tsubame KFC to do the same number of calculations -- 4.5 gigaflops per watt for the Tsubame KFC, compared with 1.9 gigaflops per watt. (A gigaflop is one billion calculations per second.) ''Twenty or 30 years ago, when I started in this business, it was a race between muscle cars,'' said Steve Conway, an analyst at IDC, a research firm. ''Everyone wanted to build the biggest, fastest supercomputer. Now, it's not muscle cars anymore. It's a family sedan.'' So far, submersive cooling has been used more widely for supercomputers than for data centers. Mr. Best said that so far, academic institutions that operate supercomputers had been more willing to experiment with the technology than the corporations that run data centers. ''You can imagine, if we walk in and say, 'Why don't you take your data center and put it in oil,' you have to have something pretty solid to point to,'' Mr. Best said. "
Winklevoss Brothers Offer an Index to Track Price of Bitcoin,"Updated, 11:03 p.m. | Stock traders have the Standard & Poor's 500. Bitcoin bettors will have the Winkdex. The new financial index takes its name from the Winklevoss brothers, famous for their legal battle with the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg. The Winkdex was released publicly on Wednesday and provides a regularly updated figure for the price of Bitcoin, the virtual currency that has risen in popularity over the last year.  Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss announced the creation of the Winkdex in a regulatory filing they made on Wednesday to the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund they first applied to create last summer. The new filing shows that the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is moving closer to regulatory approval despite skepticism in some investor circles. The brothers are now hoping to start the fund later this year, making it the first Bitcoin E.T.F. ''We've been very encouraged with how responsive and deferential the S.E.C. has been to the application,'' Cameron Winklevoss said. The brothers and their company, Math-Based Asset Services, are being represented by lawyers at Katten Muchin Rosenman who have helped shepherd some of the most popular E.T.F.'s through the regulatory process. The Winkelvoss Bitcoin Trust is set to be traded on public stock exchanges. The fund will work with other financial firms to buy and sell Bitcoin each day to remain in line with the number of outstanding shares of the E.T.F. The so-called net asset value of the fund will be adjusted at the close of trading each day, based on the value of the Winkdex. The brothers first filed for the trust last July, soon after publicly disclosing their own sizable Bitcoin holdings. The brothers have also invested in several virtual currency start-ups. Their investments recently came under scrutiny after the founder of a company in which they invested, BitInstant, was arrested and charged with money laundering. The brothers said they were passive investors in the company. The E.T.F. aims to provide an easy way for investors to bet on the future price movement of Bitcoin, which has gone through several volatile swings. Investors, though, will pay for the work that the Winklevosses' company will do to maintain and secure the Bitcoin held by the E.T.F. The size of the management fee has not yet been specified. There is already one investment fund, the Bitcoin Investment Trust, that allows Americans to bet on movements in Bitcoin's price. That fund has $50.4 million under management, but it is available only to wealthier, accredited investors, and is not publicly traded. The Winkdex will compete with a growing number of companies providing data on the virtual currency industry. The most popular index for the price of a Bitcoin is operated by CoinDesk, a news and information website. CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index is compiled using prices from two virtual currency exchanges. Until last week it also used the price from a third, Mt. Gox, but that was removed from the index after the exchange suspended customer withdrawals. The Winkdex will use data from seven exchanges and weight the prices based on the volume of trading on each exchange. Early Wednesday afternoon, the Winkdex stood at $627, up 0.7 percent from a day earlier. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Apparent Theft Rattles the Bitcoin World,"The most prominent Bitcoin exchange appeared to be on the verge of collapse late Monday, raising questions about the future of a volatile marketplace. On Monday night, a number of leading Bitcoin companies jointly announced that Mt. Gox, the largest exchange for most of Bitcoin's existence, was planning to file for bankruptcy after months of technological problems and what appeared to have been a major theft. A document circulating widely in the Bitcoin world said the company had lost 744,000 Bitcoins in a theft that had gone unnoticed for years. That would be about 6 percent of the 12.4 million Bitcoins in circulation. While Mt. Gox did not respond to numerous requests for comments, and the companies issuing the statement scrambled to determine the exact situation at Mt. Gox, which is based in Japan, the news helped push the price of a single Bitcoin below $500 for the first time since November, when it began a spike that took it above $1,200.  But at the same time that the news about Mt. Gox was emerging, a New York firm announced plans to create an exchange that could draw the world's largest banks into the virtual currency market for the first time. The new exchange is being put together by SecondMarket, which rose to fame a few years ago after creating a platform for buying and selling shares of companies like Twitter and Facebook before they went public. Without the trouble at Mt. Gox, the SecondMarket plans would have been seen as a major boon for virtual currencies, providing a potential entry point into the Bitcoin market for large banks, which have so far avoided virtual currencies as their price has skyrocketed. Barry Silbert, SecondMarket's chief executive, said that he had already talked with several banks and financial companies about joining the new exchange, along with financial regulators, and that he hoped to have it in operation this summer. But plans for any new venture will be tested by the collapse of Mt. Gox, which could shake the faith of early Bitcoin adopters. Ryan Galt, a blogger who writes frequently about Bitcoin and was one of the first to circulate the news about Mt. Gox, wrote on Monday: ''I do believe that this is one of the existential threats to Bitcoin that many have feared and have personally sold all of my Bitcoin holdings.'' On Monday, Mt. Gox took down all of its previous posts on Twitter, one day after its chief executive, Mark Karpeles, resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for virtual currencies. A statement from the chief executives of Bitcoin companies like Coinbase, Circle, Blockchain.info and Payward, said that the ''tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was the result of one company's abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of Bitcoin and the digital currency industry.'' The events are in keeping with the stark ups and downs of Bitcoin's short existence. Released in 2009 by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin program runs on the computers of anyone who joins in, and it is set to release only 21 million coins in regular increments. The coins can be moved between digital wallets using secret passwords. While Bitcoin fans have said the technology could provide a revolutionary new way of moving money around the world, skeptics have viewed it variously as a Ponzi scheme or an investment susceptible to fraud and theft. Many leading names in the Bitcoin community were still trying to determine the scope and potential consequences of the troubles at Mt. Gox. A document detailing the purported theft, labeled ''Crisis Strategy Draft,'' appeared to come from Mt. Gox. While officials at the Bitcoin Foundation could not verify the origins of the document, they were preparing for the closure of Mt. Gox. Patrick Murck, the foundation's general counsel, said that ''this incident just demonstrates the need for initiatives by responsible individuals and responsible members of the Bitcoin community like what's being described'' in SecondMarket's initiative. Mt. Gox's difficulties this week are only the latest in a long line of problems at the Tokyo-based exchange. Created in 2010, Mt. Gox quickly became the most popular place to buy and sell Bitcoins. But the firm has suffered several intrusions and technological mishaps, which have led to steep declines in the currency's price. A few weeks ago the company stopped allowing its customers to withdraw Bitcoins after it said it had discovered a flaw in some of the basic Bitcoin computer code. While other exchanges were briefly hit by problems, they came back online. Mt. Gox never opened up again, prompting speculation about its future. Until now, the major Bitcoin exchanges have all allowed anyone from the public to buy and sell virtual currency. SecondMarket's plan is to create a platform more like the New York Stock Exchange, where only large institutions can join and trade. Mr. Silbert says he will only open the exchange once they have several regulated financial institutions signed on as members. His hope, he says, is to give them partial ownership so that they have an incentive to trade there. For much of Bitcoin's life, banks have viewed the virtual currency with either derision or dismissiveness. Recently, though, a number of banks have released research reports that have been less negative. A December report from Bank of America said that virtual currencies could become an important new part of the payment system, allowing money to move more cheaply than it does with credit cards and money transmitters like Western Union. The statement from the Bitcoin companies on Monday night, which was not signed by Mr. Silbert, said that ''in order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of Mt. Gox, responsible Bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of Bitcoin and the security of all customer funds.'' "
Trading Site Failure Stirs Ire and Hope for Bitcoin,"The apparent collapse of Bitcoin's best-known and once-dominant trading platform has provoked outrage among its users, but it has also stirred hopes that the way may now be clear for more established players to transform and rein in a largely unregulated market. Hours after it stopped trading without warning Monday night, the secretive Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said that it would ""close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users."" The action and brief statement left users wondering where their money went, amid accusations that as much as 6 percent of the Bitcoins in circulation were now missing - worth more than $300 million at current exchange rates. Outside the offices of Mt. Gox in central Tokyo, disgruntled Bitcoin traders and their supporters held up signs that read ""Where Are My Bitcoins?"" ""I'm filled with disbelief,"" said Kolin Burges, a trader from London who flew to Japan this month after the exchange stopped paying out funds. ""I was prepared for the worst, but it's hard to believe they might have lost their coins.""  Yet the unanswered questions about Mt Gox did not shake the faith of many in Bitcoin. With one of its earliest online marketplaces seemingly gone, the world of virtual currency may now be forced to become a more mature part of the financial system. ""I think it's a significant event, but I think there's a decent chance that it is part of what we would call this sort of shaking out of the industry as it matures and slowly becomes a little more regulated,"" said Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York state's top financial regulator. Mr. Lawsky is not the only regulator trying to determine the next steps. Three commissioners from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were at a meeting recently where Bitcoin was on the agenda, and the agency's lawyers are also examining the regulators' options, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Financial regulators around the world have weighed in over the last few months on how to oversee Bitcoin, with some countries, like Russia, banning it altogether, and others, like Germany, generally favoring the new technology. The interest in Bitcoin is that its underlying technology holds the promise of allowing users to move money around the world without using an intermediary, thus lowering the cost of financial transactions. Troubles at Mt. Gox have rattled the Bitcoin world before. A year ago, the exchange suspended operations for several hours, and Bitcoin trading nearly ground to a halt. But since then some prominent venture capitalists have invested millions in new Bitcoin companies that are intended to provide more sophisticated platforms for virtual currency transactions. Many of those investors went public on Tuesday to declare their continued confidence in the technology. Cameron Winklevoss, an early Bitcoin proponent who, along with his brother, Tyler, owns about $64.1 million worth of the virtual currency, said that Mt Gox's closure ""underscores just how far the Bitcoin ecosystem has come."" ""Several exchanges have seamlessly picked up the slack and the market price has shown remarkable resilience,"" Mr. Winklevoss said in an email. ""Mt. Gox is in the past, and the brightest minds in the room are hard at work building a responsible and secure future."" Such optimism was reflected in the oft-volatile price of Bitcoin, which rose on Tuesday after plummeting overnight. Tuesday evening, the price of a Bitcoin stood around $525, not far from where it was when the Mt. Gox news emerged Monday night. ""There's a little bit of a sense of relief that the whole thing didn't crumble,"" said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, who has written research notes on Bitcoins. ""Over the next few weeks and months, we're going to see new exchanges either gain prominence or emerge."" Many users of Mt. Gox had long ago given up on the company after numerous incidents in which it was forced to temporarily shut down. At one point last year, Mt. Gox handled 80 percent of all Bitcoin transactions. But the exchange's market share began to significantly decline last year, when newer exchanges like Bitstamp in Slovenia, and BTC-e in Bulgaria, took its place, according to data from the Genesis Block, a virtual currency research firm. A number of other early Bitcoin companies have also struggled recently. A few weeks before the problems at Mt. Gox, the founder of the popular early exchange BitInstant, Charles Shrem, was arrested and accused of helping to facilitate drug transactions on the now-defunct online marketplace Silk Road. ""There's definitely been a clear transition happening,"" said Greg Schvey, the Genesis Block's head of research. Among the new, more experienced companies entering the space is SecondMarket, which runs an exchange for the buying and selling shares of private companies. On Monday, as Mt. Gox was preparing to go offline, SecondMarket announced its plans to start a new, regulated Bitcoin exchange for major banks. Until now, virtually all Bitcoin exchanges have allowed anyone to sign up and trade, which has made them harder to police. Companies dedicated to being more regulator-friendly for consumers and merchants, like BitPay, Coinbase and Circle, have also grown in number and size. BitPay, for example, is currently working with 24,000 merchants to take payments in Bitcoin, up from 10,000 last September and 1,000 in 2012, according to a spokeswoman. Last year, BitPay processed $110 million to $120 million in transactions. Some early Bitcoin adopters have been uncomfortable with the involvement of banks and regulators in a virtual currency whose early appeal was its apparent freedom from any central bank or government. But many of the new Bitcoin companies have said that virtual currencies will have to face more regulation if they want to be widely used. ""I think it's important always to know what the rules of the game are,"" said Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. In Japan, financial regulators have so far declined to step in to help Mt. Gox customers, saying the virtual coins are a traded product, not a currency, and therefore remain outside of their purview. Tibanne, the company that operates Mt. Gox out of Tokyo, according to the local registry office, has told other Bitcoin companies that it is planning to file for bankruptcy, according to John O'Brien, a spokesman for a coalition of Bitcoin companies that has been responding to the problems. A bankruptcy administrator could distribute Mt. Gox's assets - any remaining Bitcoins plus any nonvirtual cash - to its creditors, a process that could take a year or more. But the company could also be acquired, given the value of its customer list and name recognition. Even those who fear they have lost money they held with Mt. Gox remained enthusiastic on Tuesday about the potential of virtual currencies. ""My thoughts and my heart also go out to all of those others in the community who lost a lot more than me today,"" said Rick Falkvinge, the 42-year-old founder of the Pirate political party based in Sweden. Despite losing what he said was $80,000 in Mt. Gox, Mr. Falkvinge said that he remained ""absolutely bullish on Bitcoin.""  Hiroko Tabuchi and Ben Protess  contributed reporting.   "
"Now, Nations Mull the Ways to Regulate Bitcoin","Authorities around the world are grappling with how to regulate virtual currency in the wake of the implosion of Mt. Gox, a prominent trading platform for Bitcoin. In Tokyo, where Mt. Gox is based, Japan's top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said on Wednesday that agencies including the Financial Services Agency, the Finance Ministry and the police were collecting information on the Bitcoin trade in Japan, with an eye toward regulatory action. ''Once we assess the situation, we will respond as necessary,'' Mr. Suga told a news conference. ''At the moment, we are still in the information-gathering stage.''  Japan's new interest in Bitcoin came as authorities elsewhere were taking steps. In the weeks before the collapse of Mt. Gox, federal prosecutors in Manhattan sent a grand jury subpoena to the company, according to people briefed on the matter. The prosecutors, who had already criminally charged the founder of a popular website where Bitcoins could be bought, have formed a broader partnership with the Internal Revenue Service and other federal agencies to crack down on companies using Bitcoin exchanges to filter tainted money and support drug trafficking. New York State's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, has also signaled an interest in regulating the virtual currency. And the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is examining its potential authority over Bitcoin exchanges that have a United States presence, a person briefed on the matter said, as is the F.B.I. in New York. Mt. Gox -- its name is derived from Magic the Gathering Online Exchange, showing its origins as a gaming platform -- was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges. It stopped trading on Monday after having halted user withdrawals earlier. An unverified document that circulated on the Internet Monday night pegged Mt. Gox's losses at 744,000 Bitcoins, or 6 percent of the 12.4 million Bitcoins currently in circulation. Yet the shutdown has not curbed enthusiasm for the virtual currency. The price of Bitcoin rose about 8 percent on Wednesday, to $577, according to the virtual-currency monitoring site CoinDesk. Shortly before going offline, Bitcoins were trading on Mt. Gox at just over 20 percent of what they were selling for elsewhere. ''There were a lot of people who were trying to buy Bitcoin at what appeared to be discounted prices,'' said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. ''A lot of the demand was going to Mt. Gox, and once Mt. Gox completely shut down, that level came back into all the other exchanges.'' Another large Bitcoin exchange, BTC-e in Bulgaria, posted a notice on Tuesday saying that it would have to move to a new platform ''in order to cope with an increased number of client requests.'' ''It seems like it should be panic, but the reality on the ground is it's really not,'' said Fred Ehrsam, co-founder and president of Coinbase, which facilitates Bitcoin transactions. In a statement on Mt. Gox's website on Wednesday, its chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said he was still in Japan and ''working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues.'' He also said that Mt. Gox employees had been instructed not to give out any information and asked users to refrain from asking the staff questions. Like their counterparts elsewhere, Japanese authorities are heading into unfamiliar territory in regulating a virtual currency. A relatively easy regulatory change would be to bring Bitcoin under the purview of Japan's Payment Services Act, which oversees electronic money, shopping points and escrow transactions. That could enforce new limits on Bitcoin transactions, including their size. While Bitcoin has faced relatively little scrutiny in Japan, it has invited comparisons to an infamous scandal involving Enten, an electronic currency used by a Tokyo company to defraud investors of billions of yen in the mid-2000s. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous programmer or collective of programmers known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Attracted to the promise of lower transaction costs and a currency that could circumvent the traditional banking system, Bitcoin initially attracted a loyal following of technology aficionados, entrepreneurs and those with libertarian or anti-establishment leanings. Since then, more established players have come on board, including Marc Andreessen, who has invested in Coinbase, the brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who own about $64.1 million in Bitcoin, and Fred Wilson, a partner in the investment firm Union Square Ventures. All of those investors have voiced their support of Bitcoin in recent days. ''I will happily retweet all retractions and apologies from people who wrongly forecasted death of Bitcoin as result of Mt. Gox collapse,'' Mr. Andreessen posted on Twitter on Wednesday. Ben Protess and Zhiyi Yang contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Erosion of Faith Was Death Knell for Mt. Gox,"As the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was careening toward collapse in early February, its owner, Mark Karpeles, found that even some of his fellow virtual currency advocates were losing faith. Members of the Bitcoin Foundation's board, an important promoter of virtual currencies, were losing confidence because the exchange had been associated with another foundation member who was arrested in January on money-laundering charges. The young currency in recent months had been increasingly backed by prominent investors, but the taint of any criminal activity was starting to take over the headlines. Some wanted Mr. Karpeles, chief executive of Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based site that once had been the favored place to buy Bitcoins, to either resign from the foundation or be removed from its board, said people briefed on the matter. It was that steady erosion of faith in the Bitcoin community that ultimately served as the death knell for Mt. Gox, which had been enduring a series of problems, including having accounts frozen by authorities in the United States last year. Without the public backing of Bitcoin believers, Mt. Gox lacked the ability to get the financing it needed, those with knowledge of the discussions say.  On Friday, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection, five days after Mr. Karpeles resigned from the foundation and just days after its website suddenly went dark. The exchange said that most likely it had lost 750,000 of its customers' Bitcoin holdings and more than 100,000 of its own coins, or more than $450 million worth. At a news conference in Tokyo, Mr. Karpeles, dressed in a suit instead of his usual T-shirt, bowed in contrition and apologized in Japanese. ''There were weaknesses in the system,'' he said. ''I'm truly sorry to have caused inconvenience.'' It is not clear how much lasting damage the collapse of Mt. Gox will do to the push by venture capitalists and wealthy investors to turn Bitcoin and other digital currencies into a viable alternative to traditional currencies like the United States dollar and the euro. Digital currency advocates say other exchanges were quickly supplanting Mt. Gox as the place for people to convert traditional currencies into Bitcoin, and the impact will be short-lived. But American prosecutors are stepping up their inquiries. Prosecutors in the United States have issued subpoenas to several other related companies, including Mt. Gox and the Internet Credit Union, a credit union based in New Brunswick, N.J., and one in Japan, said several other people briefed on the matter. Prosecutors hope to better understand how money is transferred in the digital realm and converted from dollars to Bitcoin. The people briefed on the matter said they would not be surprised if authorities subpoena other companies and institutions involved in money transfers. Many of Mt. Gox's woes came shortly after Charlie Shrem, another pioneer in the world of virtual currencies, was arrested by American authorities in New York on money-laundering charges on Jan. 26. He has also since resigned. Mr. Shrem's arrest set off alarm bells at the foundation not only because he was a board member, but because the criminal complaint against him said his co-conspirator had used a ''third-party Bitcoin exchange service based in Japan'' to park his money. The clear reference to Mt. Gox unnerved the Bitcoin Foundation's other members, even though prosecutors did not claim any wrongdoing by either Mt. Gox or Mr. Karpeles. For the foundation, which is dedicated to promoting the legitimate uses of Bitcoin and combating its popular image as a plaything for the rich or as a vehicle for online drug dealers to launder money, it potentially was too much of a public relations hit for both Mr. Shrem and Mr. Karpeles to remain on the board. The case against Mr. Shrem, the 24-year-old chief executive of BitInstant, another Bitcoin exchange business, appears to grow out of the investigation into the now-defunct Silk Road, a virtual one-stop market for illegal drugs. His co-defendant, Robert Faiella, used Mr. Shrem's company to sell Bitcoin to Silk Road customers, some of whom used the electronic money to buy illegal drugs. Authorities said Mr. Shrem's company funneled more than a million dollars in Bitcoin to an account Mr. Faiella had at Mt. Gox to further the scheme, according to the complaint and people briefed on the matter. The office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, has been particularly active in cracking down on the illegal use of digital currencies, which exist in an unregulated marketplace. Last year his office indicted the operators of Liberty Reserve, a firm that used its own digital currency to facilitate money laundering for online criminals, and the operators of the Silk Road. James Margolin, a spokesman for Mr. Bharara, declined to comment on the prosecutor's Bitcoin crackdown. Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Mr. Shrem, said his client intended to plead not guilty to the charges. Mr. Shrem, who lives in New York and is also a part owner of Manhattan bar that allows patrons to pay in Bitcoin, remains one of the more vocal proponents of digital currencies even after his arrest. In conversations conducted on the phone and over email he defended Mr. Karpeles, whom he called a friend, and said any suggestion that Mr. Karpeles did anything wrong is ''preposterous.'' He said it was unfortunate that the foundation's other board members began to single out Mr. Karpeles. ''Mark had relayed to me that he's kind of frustrated with the Bitcoin community,'' said Mr. Shrem. ''He's frustrated with this whole thing.'' Over the last few weeks, Mr. Karpeles had been seeking additional financing. Last Saturday, Mr. Karpeles and a few of his close associates met to discuss a strategy to keep Mt. Gox operating. They put together a proposal and approached a small number of potential white knights, including Barry Silbert, chief executive of SecondMarket, and the Winklevoss twins, a person briefed on the discussions said. But before those talks could progress, the proposal was leaked on the Internet and rumors of Mt. Gox's troubles scuttled any potential rescue. ''They were trying to come up with a solution,'' said Roger Ver, a 35-year-old technology entrepreneur who was present at one of the meetings. Mr. Ver has been working closely with the company and said he had up to 24,000 coins in the exchange when it went offline. Mt. Gox then began warning other major Bitcoin exchanges that it was in trouble, and that its trading would soon stop temporarily, the person said. Once Mt. Gox went dark, it never opened for business again. Bitcoin prices had briefly tumbled after the site went dark, but have since recovered. On Friday Bitcoin was trading at $539, according to the website Coindesk. Still, Bitcoin investors are left to figure out what, if any, recourse they have against their losses at Mt. Gox. At least one class-action lawsuit has already been filed. ''I don't think people are going to get their money back,'' Mr. Ver said. Mr. Karpeles, known in the close-knit Bitcoin sector as reclusive, purchased Mt. Gox from its founder, Jed McCaleb, in 2011. Within two years, Mr. Karpeles helped transform it into an exchange that at one point handled 80 percent of all Bitcoin transactions. But Mt. Gox's recent problems may have been taking a toll on Mr. Karpeles, who never seemed quite suited for the spotlight. It was Gonzague Gay-Bouchery, described as Mr. Karpeles' right-hand man, who would represent him in meetings with the Bitcoin Foundation, according to people familiar with the meetings. Even before problems surfaced at Mt. Gox, Mr. Karpeles rarely socialized with colleagues and worked constantly both at home and at work, according to one business associate who did not want to be identified for fear of compromising his relationship with Mr. Karpeles. Tang Shunping, who runs an import-export business in Tokyo, said that he was trying to retrieve about 100 coins from Mt. Gox. Mr. Tang may have been among the last people to buy Bitcoin from Mt. Gox before it shut down, placing an order for 300,000 yen's worth of coins on Tuesday morning, according to his online bank statement. Less than an hour later, the site went blank. ''I trusted Mt. Gox because it's the biggest name out there, and because it's based in Tokyo,'' said Mr. Tang. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
In Search of a Stable Electronic Currency,"ROBERT J. SHILLER is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale. Bitcoin, an experiment with a radically new kind of electronic money, has exhibited many of the characteristics of a speculative bubble. That was clear long before the collapse of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox last week. Bitcoin's future is very much in doubt. Yet whatever becomes of it, something good can arise from its innovations -- even if the results are very different from its current form or its numerous competitors. What I have in mind isn't another wave of price speculation. Instead, I believe that electronic forms of money could give us better pricing, contracting and risk management. The Bitcoin phenomenon seems to fit the basic definition of a speculative bubble -- that is, a special kind of fad, a mania for holding an asset in expectation of its appreciation. Further, a bubble is publicized and amplified by news of price increases, often justified by some kind of inspiring ''new era'' story that attracts more attention as the price rises. In this case, the narrative was that a computer whiz invented a new kind of money in the form of electronic currency units, as part of a decentralized computer-driven system for a world economy that extends beyond the reach of any single government.  The central problem with Bitcoin in its present form, though, is that it doesn't really solve any sensible economic problem. Nor should it substitute for banks and the governmental institutions that regulate them. They are reasonably effective institutions, despite their flaws, and should not just be scrapped and replaced by a novel electronic system. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin success story has been tied intrinsically with instability, with excitement and envy for those who have become rich through investing in it -- rich for a while at least, because the value of the electronic currency has fluctuated wildly. The instability of Bitcoin's value in dollars is a measure of failure, not success. It means that any commerce using Bitcoin or its competitors would be buffeted by enormous inflation and deflation. But if we go back to the electronic-money drawing board, we may conclude that Bitcoin has been focused on the wrong classical functions of money, as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Bitcoin offers a way of ''mining'' electronic coins that can replace our dollar bills and bank accounts. Yet there is no fundamental need for this. Money, as we've known it for decades, works quite well in these respects. It would be much better to focus on another classical function: money as a unit of account -- that is, as a basic standard of economic measurement. Scientists spend a lot of time thinking about ways to improve systems of measurement. Business people should, too. This has already begun to happen. History shows that this unit-of-account function of money has been separated from the other two, and to good purpose. For example, since 1967 in Chile, an inflation-indexed unit of account called the unidad de fomento (U.F.), meaning unit of development, has been widely used. Financial exchanges are made in pesos, according to a U.F.-peso rate posted on the website valoruf.cl. One multiplies the U.F. price by the exchange rate to arrive at the amount owed today in pesos. In this way, it is natural and easy to set inflation-indexed prices, and Chile is much more effectively inflation-indexed than other countries are. Consider rents. Increases may seem unfair to tenants, yet they may be needed to offset inflation. In Chile, a landlord can easily set the monthly rent for the tenant in U.F.s and then never have to change it, reducing the potential for errors, delays and misunderstandings. The name ''U.F.'' reframes people's thinking so that keeping real economic values stable is natural and easy. With electronic software in the background, we can improve on the Chilean idea and make it more useful. First, we should use more evocative words and avoid jargon. I'd suggest calling the unit of account a ''basket.'' A basket is a simple description for something rather complicated. In its basic form, it is the equivalent of one day's common consumption items, like the local marketbasket of typical purchases that already underlies the Consumer Price Index. The value from one base year would be chosen so that, with inflation, the price of a basket in local currency terms would rise. A second improvement could be achieved by a credit card company or an entity like PayPal or Square Cash: Set up the electronic machinery to allow people to easily send conventional money, denominated in baskets, to anyone in the world. You would just check off a box indicating whether your payment was in dollars or pesos or euros -- or baskets. If you check ''baskets,'' the computer would calculate the amount of local currency the recipient would need to buy that basket at that time, and it would transmit it, too. A third improvement would be to move beyond just one new unit of account to a whole system of them, so that we could have baskets for different purposes. There should be senior baskets representing items consumed by older people in one day in a given country, as well as subsistence baskets representing the consumption of the poor. There should also be a day-wage unit of account representing a day's work by an average unskilled wage earner. And there could be a ''trills'' unit -- a concept that Mark Kamstra of York University and I have been advocating -- that represents one trillionth of a country's most recently estimated annual G.D.P. There should also be a unit that grows or retreats with per-capita daily consumption. This could be used for pension and Social Security payments as a form of intergenerational risk-sharing: The idea is that payments to older people would rise and fall with overall consumption. With many kinds of baskets, it will be easier to set prices and make contracts that are sensible for the long term. These are ideas about simplification of complex economic calculations. But they are borrowed from behavioral economics, which has taught us that our actions are profoundly affected by framing -- by the words we use and the approaches we take. And they are also ideas from cognitive linguistics, which implies that improved language, with new meanings for words like basket or day-wage, will change our thinking. I have been arguing for almost 20 years that we should not only copy the Chileans but also carry their ideas further into such improvements. All the recent interest in new electronic money could mean that now is the time to reconsider the foundation of our standards of value. Bitcoin has been a bubble. But the legacy of the Bitcoin experience should be that we move toward a system of stable economic units of measurement -- a system empowered by sophisticated mechanisms of electronic payment. "
"Online Black Market, Shut Down in Fall, Had a Digital Outpost in Pennsylvania","A staff member in the electrical engineering department of a liberal arts college in eastern Pennsylvania played a small role in the investigation that resulted in the shutdown last fall of Silk Road, the online marketplace where drugs and weapons could be bought with Bitcoin. The employee, Christopher Nadovich, director of laboratories in at the electrical and computer engineering department at Lafayette College, owned a company that provided Silk Road with a backup server for its website, according to a previously undisclosed court filing in the two-year investigation.  On Sept. 9, three weeks before the United States authorities shut down Silk Road and arrested Ross William Ulbricht, the man they say founded the site, an F.B.I. agent served a search warrant on Mr. Nadovich's company, JTAN.com. The warrant sought to preserve records of any transactions involving Silk Road's customers and any private communications between sellers and buyers of drugs on the website. The search warrant on JTAN and the company's involvement in the Silk Road case had remained a secret until a few weeks ago. On Feb. 18, federal prosecutors asked a United States magistrate in federal court in Philadelphia to unseal the matter so authorities could begin providing Mr. Ulbricht's lawyer with information to begin planning a legal defense. Silk Road's website ran on an encrypted Internet network called Tor, which allowed it to remain hidden from general viewing. The website, which authorities have called an eBay for illegal drugs, ran off a server in a foreign country and a backup server provided by JTAN. The search warrant illustrates the appeal a company like JTAN has for any online business that desires anonymity and uses a digital currency like Bitcoin to preserve the privacy of its customers' activities. In the search warrant, the federal authorities said that JTAN specialized in allowing ''customers to lease servers through its service with complete anonymity.'' The filing also said that JTAN never asked customers to verify their identities and permitted them ''to pay anonymously through the use of Bitcoins.'' Mr. Nadovich is not named in the warrant, but other public records identify him as the owner of JTAN, which lists an address in Easton, Pa., where Lafayette College is based. In the warrant, the company is listed as having an address in Sellersville, Pa., about 33 miles from Easton. Mr. Nadovich has not been charged with any wrongdoing. In an emailed response, he said, ''I'm afraid that I don't feel inclined to comment about Silk Road or any business decisions made by JTAN.'' Just days after the F.B.I. served the search warrant on JTAN, Mr. Nadovich began taking steps to close parts of his business. In a Sept. 14 online notice to JTAN customers that still appears on the company's website, Mr. Nadovich said he was terminating the firm's ''dedicated server'' business. Mr. Nadovich gave no explanation but said ''the business situation we find ourselves in does not allow continuing this service.'' On Oct. 30, he posted another notice, telling JTAN customers the company was struggling financially and could file for bankruptcy protection in 2014. Mr. Nadovich said on Tuesday that JTAN was still in business. James Margolin, a spokesman for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose office is prosecuting Mr. Ulbricht, declined to comment. The name of the F.B.I. agent who signed the search warrant application was redacted by authorities to protect his identity. The search warrant reveals that JTAN potentially provided the authorities with a wealth of information about Silk Road and Mr. Ulbricht. The authorities said that Silk Road's primary server would purge information every 60 days or so, but data on the backup server at JTAN was not regularly deleted or destroyed. ''I believe that this backup data will reflect the details of numerous narcotics transactions conducted through the Silk Road website and the use of Bitcoins to launder the proceeds from these transactions,'' the unidentified F.B.I. agent said in the search warrant application. Federal prosecutors contend that in a little more than two years, Mr. Ulbricht, who is 29, built Silk Road into the go-to place in the dark corners of the Internet for buying drugs like cocaine, ecstasy and heroin and stolen credit card numbers. Authorities contend the website handled $1.2 billion in transactions, all in Bitcoin. Mr. Ulbricht pleaded not guilty on Feb. 7 to money-laundering and drug-trafficking charges in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Federal prosecutors said they obtained roughly 10 terabytes of data from the servers they seized in addition to the laptop Mr. Ulbricht had with him when he was arrested by authorities on Oct. 1 at a public library in San Francisco. The government's crackdown on Silk Road and the arrest of Mr. Ulbricht began a series of embarrassing episodes for Bitcoin and digital currency enthusiasts, who see it as an alternative to traditional currencies because it is not backed by any government and not subject to political control. Bitcoin proponents suffered another black eye last week when Mt. Gox, once the biggest exchange for converting dollars and other currencies into Bitcoin, filed for bankruptcy in Japan. The company collapsed after its owner, Mark Karpeles, said it had lost more than $450 million worth of Bitcoins, possibly as the result of an attack by computer hackers. But days later, it's still not clear what happened to the roughly 750,000 of its customers' Bitcoins. In late January, another Bitcoin proponent, Charlie Shrem, was arrested by federal authorities and charged with helping a Florida man sell Bitcoin to people looking to buy drugs on Silk Road. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"For Bitcoin, Secure Future Might Need Oversight","Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo Nearly half a billion dollars has gone missing, and nobody knows how. Some say there was outright theft. Others suspect fraud. Many blame lax controls, poor oversight and, above all, a reckless, globe-spanning, Wild West culture -- a culture that everyone agrees is ripe for wholesale reform. I'm not talking about Bitcoin. I'm talking about Citigroup, which disclosed last week that its Mexican banking unit lost $400 million in a contracting swindle involving a shaky oil services company. To backers of Bitcoin, the Citigroup revelation was a convenient rhetorical weapon: Look, the digital currency's boosters say, if one of the world's largest and most tightly regulated financial institutions can also lose a boatload of money, why is everyone getting so bent out of shape about the $470 million collapse of Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange? In the last few years the conventional financial system has lurched from one new fraud to another -- from Bernie Madoff to MF Global to the hacking at Target -- and yet nobody suggests abandoning dollars as a means of trade. Why aren't we just as forgiving in our approach to Bitcoin?  It's a tidy argument. But the comparison between Citigroup's loss and the fall of Mt. Gox highlights just how unusual and untamable digital currency can be. When scandal engulfs traditional financial institutions like Citigroup, there are investigations and calls for greater oversight -- human oversight. Bitcoin, though, was born of mistrust of humans and their institutions. It rests on the belief that financial safety emerges from the integrity of the technology, a computer code that controls a payment system, rather than the trustworthiness of the humans who participate in it. To save their nascent currency, Bitcoin's backers may be forced to alter their philosophy and embrace the same messy humans -- auditors, insurers and even regulators -- that the currency's most ardent supporters have long abhorred. This raises two difficult questions: Can human oversight integrate into Bitcoin's free-for-all ethos quickly enough to render Bitcoin safe? And, can Bitcoin be made safer without tamping down on the very openness that proponents say makes Bitcoin such a cheap, efficient and innovative financial platform? At the moment, the answers are still very much up in the air. Some in the more mainstream part of the Bitcoin world -- firms that have sought venture capital and are trying to appeal to ordinary investors and large businesses -- say they're up to the challenge. They are working to set up stringent technical and financial audits of trading sites, and to create insurance mechanisms so that holders of Bitcoin won't be wiped out by catastrophic losses like the one at Mt. Gox. There are even efforts to pursue government oversight. ''We are reaching out to regulators, because we do want Bitcoin to be a regulated industry,'' said Brian Armstrong, the co-founder and chief executive of Coinbase, a site that allows people to purchase, store and trade with Bitcoin and that has received investments from some of Silicon Valley's leading venture firms. He said he had met with state and federal regulators to discuss Bitcoin. ''Even if everybody in Bitcoin doesn't believe in regulation, we think it's one way to help Bitcoin grow up and have more transactions flow over the network.'' The most straightforward way of improving the safety of Bitcoin is also the most obvious: running independent audits of sites. Mt. Gox, which acted as a Bitcoin exchange site as well as a ''wallet'' that stored people's coins, never once offered a public accounting showing it possessed all the funds it claimed to be storing, nor showing the technical methods it was using to safeguard those funds. The site's opacity will make investigating its loss more difficult. Theories about how Mt. Gox really lost all that money, and who has it now, have consumed Bitcoin discussion sites for much of the last week. Mt. Gox has said it was hacked over a period of years, apparently through a well-known but minor flaw in Bitcoin known as ''transaction malleability.'' The flaw allows hackers to alter a Bitcoin payment while it's in progress, potentially confusing a trading site into issuing a double payment. But in the absence of an audit trail, many in the Bitcoin world have trouble believing the hacking claim. On the other hand, every other leading theory for how Mt. Gox might have lost a half-billion dollars -- whether government theft or cryptographic error -- has been debunked, too. It's possible that we'll never really know what happened to that half-billion dollars. It has simply vanished. Mr. Armstrong said that to prevent something similar from ever happening at Coinbase, the firm plans to hire independent auditors to conduct a public investigation of both its Bitcoin and dollar holdings. The site also recently published a ''security audit'' of its technical processes, which showed it did live up to its claim of storing most of its Bitcoin holdings in ''cold storage,'' meaning on machines that are not connected to the Internet. Then there are more far-reaching efforts to secure Bitcoin. Elliptic, a British Bitcoin storage site, offers optional insurance on your holdings. For a fee of about 2 percent of your coins per year, the site promises to repay you if theft or negligence results in the loss of your funds. Another firm, Inscrypto, is working on what it calls a ''decentralized version of the F.D.I.C.,'' a system similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which protects your checking account. The system, which is still a work in progress, is far more complex than traditional deposit insurance, using derivative trades to protect against price swings or other dangers of Bitcoin. At the moment, it's unclear how much it will cost, or even if it will work. The company, like several others in the Bitcoin world, declined to be quoted on the topic. To some supporters of Bitcoin, the rise of these consumer protection ideas is itself proof of the digital currency's superiority over old-fashioned currency. One of Bitcoin's most cherished technical tenets is openness, the idea that anyone, anywhere, can set up a trading node on the payment network. Openness lowers barriers to entry; it allows sites with newer, safer, more innovative financial ideas to easily peddle their wares, while rickety concerns like Mt. Gox die under their own incompetence. It sets up a Darwinian race toward a safer Bitcoin. In the short run, this dynamic causes terrible consequences for users, but eventually, Bitcoin's supporters say, the worst problems will get ironed out. One frequent analogy in the Bitcoin world is to the early days of the Internet and web. Just a decade and a half ago, the web was a rough-and-tumble network ruled by pornography and illegal file-trading, a place where fraud flourished and danger lurked around every corner. Today the web is still all that, but it is also, in its more respectable corners, the place where you post pictures of your children, where you shop for Christmas presents, where you hold secure conversations with your doctor and where companies make billions of dollars every year without worry of being defrauded. ''The history of Bitcoin is going to be largely the same,'' Mr. Armstrong said. It starts with a ''fundamental breakthrough that lowered the cost of payments, but there will be a lot of details to get right, and like on the early Internet, it will take time for the fundamental infrastructure to get established.'' Once that happens, Mr. Armstrong says he believes that digital currencies will be unstoppable. Unless, of course, the thought of a half-billion dollars disappearing without a trace makes people queasy enough to stay away from Bitcoin for good. "
Bitcoin's Mysterious Creator Is Said to Be Found,"Updated, 9:42 p.m. | Even as it has grown into a new type of digital money worth billions of dollars, Bitcoin has always retained an air of mystery. Central to its cachet has been the mythic status of the system's creator. Its developer went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, but that is all that Bitcoin's adopters seemed to know -- or wanted to know. After all, Bitcoin was a project dedicated in part to making it easier to avoid the all-seeing gaze of the government and corporate America. But the inventor of the virtual currency may not be quite the international man of mystery that some aficionados imagined him to be. Could he in fact be a model-train fanatic living with his mother in a modest house in Southern California? That, at least, was what Newsweek, with a newly revived print version, reported on Thursday. But the man the magazine claimed to be behind the Bitcoin curtain has a similar name -- Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto -- which raised questions about why he had not been discovered sooner. Many digital currency aficionados said they doubted the veracity of the report.  The Mr. Nakamoto identified in the article denied involvement in Bitcoin on Thursday after a car chase involving a crowd of reporters. He told The Associated Press that he had not heard of the virtual currency until his son told him about being contacted by a reporter three weeks ago. On Thursday evening, an online Bitcoin forum account long believed to belong to the real Satoshi Nakamoto posted a one-sentence denial that he was the man identified in California. It was the account's first activity in more than three years. If the identification is wrong, it would not be the first time that a reporter had incorrectly determined the identity of Bitcoin's creator. Yet even if the report proves correct, virtual currency proponents at Bitcoin conferences in Texas and Barbados said that identifying Mr. Nakamoto would be a violation of the privacy the currency was intended to protect. Whatever the conclusion, the furor on Thursday laid bare just how far Bitcoin had moved beyond its humble origins five years ago -- and just how much it still relied on the mystique of those beginnings. ''In reality, a lot of people didn't want to know,'' said Arianna Simpson, a Bitcoin entrepreneur. ''Not knowing and thinking that maybe it had been a community project, again, I think was very well tied to the essence of Bitcoin. To have it exposed in this way I don't think does anybody a particular service.'' For Mr. Nakamoto, Newsweek's outing was clearly an unwelcome event. On Thursday, a team of journalists was camped outside his house in Temple City, Calif. When a reporter knocked on his front door, an older woman answered, but Mr. Nakamoto quickly came to shut the door, shouting, ''No, no, no,'' as he did. If Mr. Nakamoto, 64, is Bitcoin's creator, he is thought to own hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of the digital money. Because Bitcoin are generally stored on computer hard drives, many Bitcoin users say that Mr. Nakamoto has been made into a target for criminals who might look to steal his coins. The magazine's report comes at a turning point for the Bitcoin industry. Last week, the virtual currency world was rattled by the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the dominant exchange for buying and selling Bitcoin. The company filed for bankruptcy in Japan last Friday, claiming to have lost about 750,000 customer coins, or nearly $500 million. The bankruptcy sent users scrambling to figure out where their money had gone, and it prompted renewed calls from lawmakers and others to increase government oversight of an industry that has no official regulator. The Newsweek article did not do any immediate damage to the currency itself. The price of a Bitcoin dipped a bit early on Thursday, but it recovered most of the losses, trading at around $650 by evening. Still, Bitcoin watchers said that the creator's supposed anonymity had played a vital role in the growth of a virtual currency that has become a potent symbol for privacy advocates and critics of government power. ''Having this level of mystery allowed people to project their optimism and their hopes onto the currency,'' said Richard Peterson, the chief executive of MarketPsych, a research company that has studied virtual currencies. ''If it's true and people start to believe it, it undermines that mystique.'' What is known for sure about the creator of Bitcoin is that the person or group of people going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto posted a paper on an obscure mailing list in the fall of 2008 describing a new type of digital money. Bitcoin, as the creator called it, would be run according to a set of rules that would be downloaded on all the computers that joined in. One of the rules determined that only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created, through a process known as mining. In the months after the system went live, Satoshi Nakamoto emailed with his fellow collaborators but never gave any private details, and he refused to talk on the phone or meet in person. The only information came from a programming website, where a profile described him as a 38-year-old man in Japan. Mike Hearn, who became involved with Bitcoin a few months after it was created, said that initially, Bitcoin was too small and insignificant for the identity of its creator to be a concern. But as it grew, Mr. Hearn went back and looked at his emails with Satoshi Nakamoto and found that they had been sent through an encryption service that obscured their origin. Previous investigations by journalists have suggested that Satoshi Nakamoto might have been, variously, a young British banker, a Finnish programmer and an American law professor. But in each case, the people under suspicion have denied being Bitcoin's creator. In the absence of any hard evidence, many Bitcoin users have built Satoshi Nakamoto into a sort of hero, imagining him as a selfless genius who created a system that would allow for greater economic freedom. The Mr. Nakamoto in Southern California confirms at least a part of that story. He is a physicist who graduated from California State Polytechnic University. A neighbor, Andrew Kent, said Mr. Nakamoto was ''quiet and easygoing'' and ''clearly smart.'' But given the sophistication of the original Bitcoin idea, some experts have doubted it could be the creation of one person, even a genius. At a conference on cryptography in Barbados on Thursday, many attendees discussed the evidence, or lack of evidence, linking Mr. Nakamoto with Bitcoin. ''My personal opinion, I don't think this is the right person,'' said Stefano Zanero, assistant professor at the computer engineering department of Politecnico di Milano in Italy. ''It just doesn't add up, and quite honestly, I think that there were a lot of assumptions.'' Social networks, meanwhile, compared the polished writing of Bitcoin's creator with online writings apparently posted by Mr. Nakamoto, some of which were written in imperfect English. ''I think it is very clear the writings are not made by the same person,'' Roger Ver, a Bitcoin enthusiast and investor, said in an email. ''I hope the real Satoshi is never found.'' The real Satoshi Nakamoto could prove his or her identity fairly easily by making changes to an original Bitcoin account or by providing the security code that was attached to emails shared with a small group of Bitcoin's earliest programmers. Proving someone is not Satoshi Nakamoto, however, is tougher. In Texas, at a Bitcoin conference that began on Wednesday, Brian Page, the director of communication for a company called Bitshares, said that initially, he was shocked by the apparent unmasking, but then he reflected. ''I have no idea if it's the guy or not, but it doesn't matter,'' he said. ''He created something historic but it doesn't matter if he is found. Bitcoin is launched and it's not under his control or anyone's control.'' Quentin Hardy and Jenna Wortham contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Newsweek Returns to Print and Sets Off a Bitcoin Storm,"After being out of print for 14 months, Newsweek wanted its return to the newsstands to land with a splash. So it put out an issue with a darkened cover featuring a theatrical silver mask, and made an explosive claim: It had uncovered the mysterious founder of the digital currency Bitcoin. Within hours of publication, however, the story seemed to swell from a splash to a runaway tsunami of attention, much of it negative. The man Newsweek identified as Bitcoin's founder, Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a reclusive train collector from California, gave a two-hour interview to The Associated Press saying that the story was wrong.  Reporters and commentators quickly questioned whether the writer, Leah McGrath Goodman, had produced the definitive proof her magazine had promised, noting that the central quote from Mr. Nakamoto appeared to fall short of a clear confirmation. Amateur sleuths on the Internet tried to challenge the evidence in the face of a heavy dose of hostility aimed at the author directly. Newsweek's editor in chief, Jim Impoco, on Friday offered a vigorous defense of the article. ''We are absolutely standing by this,'' he said in a phone interview. He added that the idea that the story hung on the brief confirmation from Mr. Nakamoto was wrong. ''It was an exhaustive investigation,'' he said. ''We brought in help from M.I.T. All leads led to him.'' Ms. Goodman on Friday seemed surprised at the ferocity of the attacks against her. On ''CBS This Morning,'' she insisted again that Mr. Nakamoto had definitely confirmed to her that he was a founder. Referring to a bizarre scene on Thursday, when reporters who were camped outside Mr. Nakamoto's house formed a caravan to follow him down the highway to the A.P. interview, she told CBS: ''Seeing him flee the scene and now deny it, I have to say it is mystifying to me.'' The article describes a brief conversation outside Mr. Nakamoto's house witnessed by two deputies from the sheriff's office, in which Ms. Goodman asked him about Bitcoin. ''I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,'' she quotes him as saying. ''It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.'' Mr. Nakamoto told The A.P. that he had misunderstood what she was asking him. In an emailed statement to The New York Times, Ms. Goodman wrote in part: ''My conversation with Mr. Nakamoto followed two months of team-based research that connected the dots to him -- and only him -- in multiple ways. I can definitively say that in our conversation, he made clear he understood we were talking about Bitcoin.'' Adam L. Penenberg, a journalism professor at New York University and editor of the digital newsletter PandoDaily, was among the skeptical commentators, tweeting: ''High risk, high reward, disastrous if you're wrong. Putting it on the cover with such flimsy proof was a poor editorial decision.'' In featuring the Bitcoin story, Newsweek was engaging a particularly passionate audience. Bitcoin, a virtual currency that is meant to allow smooth financial transactions across borders without government involvement, has a zealous group of devoted technologists, speculators and libertarian ideologues. It has also recently made headlines in several areas -- for its big-name investors like the Winklevoss twins, and, most recently, the spectacular bankruptcy filing of a trading exchange, Mt. Gox, with more than $450 million worth of coins reported to have gone missing. And as Bitcoin has gone from a fringe digital experiment to a mainstream digital experiment, the search for its secretive creator, or creators, has become something of a holy grail. There are few leads to go on -- other than the name, ''Satoshi Nakamoto,'' similar to Mr. Nakamoto's own name, and some writings online, including a white paper from 2008. Still, publications like The New Yorker, Fast Company and Vice have spent significant reporting time trying to reveal the Bitcoin inventor's identity. The New Yorker's piece was typical, concluding: ''The currency is both real and elusive -- just like its founder.'' In her article and in later interviews, Ms. Goodman (who goes by the Twitter handle @truth-eater) said she had delved into databases and even worked with a team of forensic investigators to track down Mr. Nakamoto's identity. She said she got his email address from a company where he bought his model trains. The disclosure of the lengths she went to investigate Mr. Nakamoto seemed only to enrage Bitcoin fans. Many on the web, and in particular on the social news site Reddit, expressed sympathy for the toll this has taken on Mr. Nakamoto, whether he is the creator of Bitcoin or not, and were outraged that Newsweek saw fit to invade his privacy. ''I hope the media realizes just how low they've gone this time, and though I don't take any satisfaction in saying this, I hope the public backlash on them is breathtakingly vicious,'' wrote a commentator with the handle ferretinjapan. On Friday, Newsweek issued a plea for restraint, saying in a statement that it ''encourages all to be respectful of the privacy and rights of the individuals involved.'' In the statement, the magazine also said, ''It is natural and expected for a major news revelation such as this to spark debate and controversy'' and said it was ''committed to furthering that spirit of open discourse.'' Ms. Goodman, in a phone interview, suggested that people would have to draw their own conclusions from the material she presented. ''Everyone wants a smoking gun,'' she said. Later she added, ''If people are like 'I want more, that is not enough,' I don't know what to say. I want more as well.'' "
Virtual Exchange Plans Are Sought in New York,"Updated, 8:48 p.m. | At a time when some government agencies are backing away from virtual currency, New York's top financial regulator is taking a big step forward. On Tuesday, Benjamin M. Lawsky, superintendent of financial services, officially asked for proposals to create regulated virtual currency exchanges. The same day, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulator, issued a stern warning to investors about the risks of Bitcoin. ''The companies that are now being asked to come apply in this order are going to largely be the companies that say, 'We have the desire, wherewithal and the resources to do this the right way,' '' Mr. Lawsky said in an interview. ''We are creating a situation where we'll hopefully be driving consumer confidence in the firms that want to come here now and set up their exchanges with all the appropriate protections in place.''  Mr. Lawsky's office, the Department of Financial Services, said it was working on a ''BitLicense'' for companies operating in New York, but it has not yet unveiled the regulatory framework that would ultimately guide any proposals. In a statement, the office said it intended to do so ''no later than the end of the second quarter of 2014.'' But until other states and countries put their own guidelines in place, registration in New York can go only so far since companies operate across state lines and international boundaries. ''If we do it right, it could be a nice model for other states,'' Mr. Lawsky said. Government agencies have been struggling with just how to regulate Bitcoin, the computer-driven virtual currency that has no backing from a central bank. Buyers and sellers of Bitcoins have largely operated on the fringes of the financial system, which has appealed to a core group of anti-establishment enthusiasts. It has also made the value of Bitcoin fluctuate wildly, and it provides few options when things go south. The collapse of Mt. Gox, one of the industry's largest online exchanges, sent many users scrambling to figure out if there was any way to recover the nearly $500 million the company said it had lost. In its warning, the regulatory body known as Finra said that ''speculative trading in Bitcoins carries significant risk,'' and it warned that ''as with so many other 'hot' or new trends, fraudsters may see the latest digital currency trend as a chance to steal your money through old-fashioned fraud.'' Bitcoin supporters are quick to point out, however, that Mt. Gox was one of the earliest Bitcoin companies, and that it had been losing ground to newer businesses that often came with strong backing from established venture capital firms. That shift has led Bitcoin to a crossroads, as some government authorities prepare for virtual currency to reach a broader audience. Mr. Lawsky has made his openness to Bitcoin clear. He said on Tuesday that his office would be looking for sufficient cybersecurity protections and capital reserves and would conduct background checks on any potential management teams. ''I think it's a very big deal,'' said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. ''I think this is the type of regulatory treatment Bitcoin was hoping for.'' The lack of regulation has contributed to Bitcoin's wild price fluctuations. In less than five years, the value of a Bitcoin has gone from just a few dollars to more than $1,000. Bitcoin is now trading around $631, according to the virtual currency website CoinDesk. Bitcoin supporters are preparing for governments to take more active roles in the virtual currency. The Bitcoin Foundation, an industry advocacy group, announced on Tuesday that it had added two full-time staff members, bringing its work force to eight. Jim Harper, a director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, the libertarian research group, will join the foundation as global policy counsel. Amy Weiss, who previously served as a White House deputy press secretary under Bill Clinton, will be serving as an outside consultant to the foundation. Both, like all of the foundation's staff, will be paid in Bitcoins. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
China Puts a Stop to Plans for Virtual Credit Cards,"HONG KONG -- China's central bank has ordered the Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent to halt plans to issue virtual credit cards in partnership with a large Chinese bank, citing concern over safety risks.  The People's Bank of China wants to assess the risks that customers using the untested service may face and to ask the companies to provide more details about their plans, Feng Xinya, a central bank official, told the state-run People's Daily on Friday. Ms. Feng declined to say how long the assessment would take. This month, the two companies separately announced plans to team up with China Citic Bank International to create the virtual cards for online transactions and for offline retailers that accept payments by scanning a QR code -- an image similar to a bar code -- with their smartphones. Alibaba, China's biggest e-commerce company, and Tencent, which operates the country's biggest chat service, have been expanding into financial services. They are among 10 companies selected to participate in a pilot program that allows the establishment of five private banks, as part of a program of financial overhauls pledged by the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping. Alipay from Alibaba was to begin issuing as many as one million virtual credit cards this month. Alibaba said it would approve the creditworthiness of prospective cardholders based on their online shopping histories. Online retail sales in China are forecast to reach $395 billion by 2015, according to a report by McKinsey & Company. Alibaba and Tencent confirmed on Friday that they had been notified by the central bank, but declined to comment further. The central bank did not respond to queries about the action, reported by the Guangzhou-based 21st Century Business Herald. Shares of Tencent Holdings closed 4.1 percent lower in Hong Kong. Citic Bank fell 6.9 percent in Hong Kong before it requested a halt in trading ''pending the release of a clarification announcement.'' Citic shares traded in Shanghai fell 8.3 percent. Alibaba, whose major shareholders include SoftBank and Yahoo, is privately held and is expected to list shares this year. The central bank's move highlights China's caution in nontraditional payment methods as it tries to maintain a tight grip on the country's financial institutions. In December, the Chinese authorities barred banks and third-party payment processors from providing services related to Bitcoin, a digital currency that soared in value late last year; its usage has been growing worldwide as governments consider regulation. In 2007, China's central bank cracked down on Q Coin, a digital currency issued by Tencent that was initially used for purchases of virtual items, like avatars to be used on social media profiles. "
Putative Bitcoin Founder Categorically Denies It,"Around 10 days after being identified by Newsweek magazine as the mysterious creator of the digital currency Bitcoin, Dorian Nakamoto, a 64-year-old semi-employed engineer, has hired a lawyer and issued a statement unconditionally denying that he had any involvement in Bitcoin. ''I am writing this statement to clear my name,'' Mr. Nakamoto said in the statement released early Monday morning by his lawyer, Ethan D. Kirschner of Los Angeles. ''I did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin.''  Mr. Nakamoto said in the statement that he first heard the term Bitcoin last month from his son after Newsweek contacted the son about the article. He also noted that he had recently fallen on hard times, working as a polltaker and substitute teacher. And in a disclosure clearly meant to challenge his identification as a technological revolutionary, Mr. Nakamoto said he discontinued his Internet service in 2013 because he could not afford it. The statement increased the pressure on Newsweek, which had just returned to print under new owners with the Bitcoin article on its cover. It also appeared to lay the groundwork for possible litigation against Newsweek, legal experts said. Mr. Nakamoto included assertions that his prospects for gainful employment have been harmed by the article and that the ''false report has been the source of a great deal of confusion and stress for myself, my 93-year-old mother, my siblings and their families.'' Newsweek has vigorously defended its reporting and the accuracy of its identification of Mr. Nakamoto, which the article's author, Leah McGrath Goodman, has said was based on months of reporting. On Monday, Newsweek said that it had not received any statement or letter from either Mr. Nakamoto or his lawyer. ''If and when we do,'' the magazine said, ''we will respond as necessary.'' Once a division of The Washington Post Company, Newsweek has struggled in recent years and been passed among several owners. In 2010, The Post sold it to the businessman Sidney Harman, who later teamed up with Barry Diller. They subsequently sold it to IBT Media, a small digital publishing company, who installed as editor in chief Jim Impoco, a former Sunday business editor at The New York Times. IBT's owners trumpeted Newsweek's return to print as reflecting a renewed interest in the storied brand. The Bitcoin article created a splash, but now the magazine finds itself facing pointed questions. Bill Grueskin, dean of academic affairs at the Columbia Journalism School, noted how unusual it was for ''the very person at the heart of story to directly challenge the story.'' ''I don't understand Newsweek's response,'' Mr. Grueskin said. ''It feels like something done by lawyers rather than editors.'' In reporting on Bitcoin, Newsweek has tapped into a phenomenon: a passionate online community of believers in a digital currency that operates independently of governments and banks. Fueled by speculators and a few businesses that use the currency to conduct businesses, the price of a Bitcoin has shot up in value, making the entire system worth billions of dollars. The mystery of who created the system has fascinated other publications and technologists since Bitcoin was created in 2008 by a still unknown individual, or group, known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Newsweek said it had found its man, identifying him as Mr. Nakamoto of Temple City, Calif., whose full name is Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. But from the moment the article was published, skeptics tried to poke holes in the reporting, while others objected to Ms. Goodman's aggressive approach with Mr. Nakamoto, which led him to call the police when she appeared at his front door. It was that encounter that Ms. Goodman has pointed to as evidence buttressing Newsweek's claim that Mr. Nakamoto invented Bitcoin. ''I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,'' he said, according to the article. ''It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.'' Yet in the statement issued by his lawyer, Mr. Nakamoto said that despite some programming skills, he lacked the expertise that would seem crucial to creating Bitcoin. ''I have no knowledge of nor have I ever worked on cryptography, peer-to-peer systems or alternative currencies,'' he said. If Mr. Nakamoto sued Newsweek asserting that he did not invent Bitcoin, legal experts say that his most likely claim would be that he was depicted in a ''false light.'' Even though what Newsweek said about Mr. Nakamoto would generally be viewed as complimentary -- a genius programmer who created a potentially revolutionary virtual currency -- he would still have grounds to bring a lawsuit. ''People get offended when certain kinds of false things are said about them,'' said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, ''even if they are too positive.'' He cited the example of the baseball great Warren Spahn who sued in the 1960s over being incorrectly described as having earned a bronze star in World War II. The rationale for a claim of being portrayed in a ''false light,'' Mr. Volokh said, was simply that ''I don't want people to think things about me that aren't true.'' Mr. Nakamoto painted a bleak picture of his recent life in his statement, saying he is in frail health. ''I have not been able to find steady work as an engineer or programmer for 10 years,'' he said. ''I am trying to recover from prostate surgery in October 2012 and a stroke I suffered in October of 2013.'' He ended his statement saying: ''This will be our last public statement on this matter. I ask that you now respect our privacy.'' "
Investors Buy Stakes in Bitcoin Firm,"Several prominent investment firms are joining forces to buy stakes in one of the biggest Bitcoin operations in the world. The publicly traded New York private equity and hedge fund firm Fortress Investment Group and two other investors are buying a stake in Pantera Bitcoin Partners, a San Francisco-based hedge fund operator that buys and sells virtual currencies. The creation of the partnership represents a significant step in the push to move Bitcoin into the financial mainstream at a time when several well-publicized claims of theft have pointed to potential weaknesses in the digital currency economy.  Pantera Capital, the parent of Pantera Bitcoin, was founded in 2003 by Dan Morehead, a veteran of the hedge fund giant Tiger Management. For most of its existence, Pantera was a macro hedge fund. But since 2011, Mr. Morehead has grown increasingly fascinated with Bitcoin, he said in an interview on Tuesday. In recent months, he said, the firm's staff of 16 has shifted its attention to work full time on investments in the virtual currency world. ''We're very excited about the promise of Bitcoin and how it can transform the way we move money,'' Mr. Morehead said. ''The promise and possibilities here are very broad.'' When Pantera made its first regulatory filing in December, its Bitcoin fund was worth $147 million. That is significantly larger than the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a $55 million fund run by the New York firm SecondMarket that holds virtual currencies on behalf of investors. The big venture capital firms Benchmark Capital and Ribbit Capital are taking stakes in Pantera Bitcoin Partners, along with Fortress. All are committing to buy and sell Bitcoin and other virtual currencies through Pantera. Michael E. Novogratz, an executive at Fortress, had previously talked about his interest in Bitcoin, but until now it has been unclear how the firm was approaching digital money as an investment. Moving forward, Fortress said that it would make all of its Bitcoin purchases through Pantera.''This partnership brings together leading companies with a range of relevant expertise, well positioned to lead and capitalize on a potentially transformative evolution,'' Mr. Novogratz said. In the years after the Bitcoin program was released by an anonymous founder known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, most of the dominant players were small start-ups with few links to the traditional financial world. Part of the allure of Bitcoin was that it allowed users to move and store money outside the banking system. Recently, however, a number of pioneers, like the Japanese exchange Mt. Gox, have run into trouble, shaking confidence in the entire Bitcoin network. At the same time, investors and financial firms with more established credentials have been expressing their growing interest in Bitcoin. Last week, Goldman Sachs became the latest Wall Street firm to issue a research report on Bitcoin's potential to shake up different parts of the financial system. Much of the research has been focused on Bitcoin not just as a form of digital money, but also as a new payment system, buttressed by the computers linked into the Bitcoin network. The system is run according to a prewritten set of rules, which determines how the coins are created and moved between digital wallets. Mr. Morehead's management firm is giving up some of its ownership in Pantera Bitcoin Partners, which manages the Bitcoin fund. But all of the companies involved in Pantera Bitcoin Partners will continue to make their own investments in virtual currency start-up companies. Earlier this week, all four firms teamed up to make a $20 million investment in Xapo, a start-up that offers to secure the information needed to unlock Bitcoins in guarded vaults so that they cannot be reached by hackers. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Placing Their Bets on Bitcoin,"HONG KONG -- By day, David Shin is an investment banker at a major financial firm. By night and in pretty much every other free minute, he is an entrepreneur looking to break into Hong Kong's growing Bitcoin scene. Even as concerns swirl about the long-term viability of the virtual currency, Mr. Shin is raising money, courting clients and hiring staff to build a sort of stock exchange for Bitcoin-oriented companies. Mr. Shin, 38, plans to start his venture, CryptoMex, at the end of April. ''I believe Bitcoin will bring about a brave new world of money,'' he said. ''The Internet started out as a revolutionary protocol, became more easy to use over time, and saw an explosive growth rate. The same is happening with Bitcoin.'' Mr. Shin joins a growing field of technology experts, financial players and crypto-geeks who are betting that an unfavorable regulatory environment in mainland China has put this special administrative region -- with its more laissez-faire attitude -- on the edge of something big.  Bitcoin, digital money backed by no government and ''mined'' by computers performing complex algorithms, have been largely unregulated, creating a virtual Wild West of programmers and speculators. But as Bitcoin tries to gain greater mainstream acceptance, authorities around the world have begun eyeing it more cautiously, as they might a currency. The spectacular collapse of Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange, has only fanned regulators' concerns. Regulatory moves in China have been among the more aggressive to date. In December, the Chinese authorities curtailed the use of Bitcoin by banks and payment processors, which helped halve the value of the virtual currency in two weeks. While the government said the general public was free to trade Bitcoin online, the broad fear is that China may eventually impose a sweeping ban on its use offline, as it did in 2009 to Q Coin, a virtual currency issued by Tencent. But Hong Kong has so far remained relatively passive on the regulatory front. The former British colony has retained a separate political and economic system since it returned to Chinese rule, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's de facto central bank, says it is not directly regulating Bitcoin, at least for now. Entrepreneurs in Hong Kong are essentially playing regulatory arbitrage. Although firm data is scarce, China is widely seen as the world's second-largest market for Bitcoin, after the United States, and the restrictions have cooled its nascent Bitcoin scene. By virtue of proximity, businesses in Hong Kong are hoping to capture some of the demand. ''Like water, Bitcoin may take the path of least resistance and find its way into Hong Kong,'' said Michael Chau, a business professor at the University of Hong Kong. ''Because of the city's proximity to China -- and because it has become part of the country since 1997 -- Hong Kong has the potential to absorb part of China's Bitcoin market.'' The Chinese customer base of Laser Yuan, the founder of the Hong Kong-based exchange BitCashOut, doubled after the December notice. Three weeks ago, ANX, Hong Kong's largest Bitcoin exchange, opened what it said was the world's first brick-and-mortar store for the virtual currency, where customers can buy Bitcoin over the counter. It also set up a Bitcoin vending machine last week. Robocoin, a maker of Bitcoin automated teller machines, will set up its first A.T.M. in Hong Kong this spring, and plans 100 more around the world, none in China, said the company's chief executive, Jordan Kelley. ''We have hundreds and hundreds of Chinese businessmen and entrepreneurs contact us with the purpose of becoming Robocoin operators,'' Mr. Kelley said, adding that if China gave him the green light, the company would ''have 200 A.T.M.s in China before the end of the year, if not more.'' Mr. Shin said he first saw the promise of Bitcoin last year, when the coins were worth $25 apiece, compared with about $620 now. After raising $2.5 million, he and his business partners built IceDrill, an operation in Montreal where racks of speedy computers race to generate Bitcoin. But he is now selling part of his stake in the Canadian mine and focusing on his start-up in Hong Kong, which he said could be ''the capital of Bitcoin in Asia.'' Mr. Shin recently hired Jake Smith, a well-connected Bitcoin enthusiast who worked for Li Xiaolai -- a Chinese investor who reportedly holds 100,000 coins -- to get Chinese to buy into the companies listed on his platform. ''When the government comes out and puts constraints on Bitcoin in China, investors naturally look at Hong Kong -- not Singapore, not Korea -- for substitution,'' Mr. Shin said. Hong Kong operates in a type of regulatory limbo, so uncertainty reigns as much as opportunity. If China clamps down further, Hong Kong may be forced to rethink its stance. John Greenwood, chief economist at Invesco and architect of Hong Kong's exchange-rate system, said that whether the Chinese authorities would toughen measures depended on whether Bitcoin became so prevalent that it undermined China's capital controls. ''China's mainland residents can buy things with Bitcoin from Europe or North America or anywhere else in the world, or make transfers,'' Mr. Greenwood said. ''It's a hole in the dike, a leakage from China's system of foreign-exchange control.'' Entrepreneurs like Mr. Shin also face a legacy of past ventures that have proved problematic. Two once-prominent Bitcoin crowdfunding platforms, BTCST and Bitfunder, are now defunct. BTCST, which offered Bitcoin-denominated securities that claimed to return up to 7 percent a week, has been charged by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission with fraud and with running a Ponzi scheme. ''The operating environment is much clearer,'' Mr. Shin said. ''The Hong Kong government has acknowledged Bitcoin as a commodity, so we have clarity on both fronts here as well.'' Then there is the need for better basic infrastructure and consumer awareness, a challenge for Bitcoin around the world. For example, few businesses let customers make payments with the currency. In Hong Kong, they largely amount to a boutique hotel, a flower shop, a tailor, a music teacher and a Beijing-style crepe restaurant. On the eve of the Chinese New Year in January, the three co-founders of the Bitcoin exchange ANX took to the bustling streets of the Lan Kwai Fong entertainment district to hand out 50,000 red envelopes, each carrying a little more than a dollar's worth of Bitcoin. ''I use Bitcoin to buy stuff online all the time,'' Ben Lau, an online marketer, said as he stood on the sidewalk using his smartphone to scan the QR code -- an image that works like a bar code -- on the voucher he had just received. But Mr. Lau was in the minority. Even months after Bitcoin leapt into the limelight, most passers-by had little idea about what it does, and some associated it with drugs and fauds. When the after-work crowd diminished, the co-founders went to a nearby bar to check on rumors that it had recently started accepting Bitcoin. A few beers later, Ken Lo, managing director of ANX, waved for the bill and asked to pay in the virtual currency. ''A customer's friend thought our bar had a matching name -- Bit Point -- with Bitcoin, so he helped us set this up,'' said Gaga Lam, the bar's manager. ''We haven't really tried it out yet.'' Her iPad Mini displayed the website of BitPay, the Bitcoin payment processor in which Asian billionaire Li Ka-shing was an early investor. But the group ended up paying with a credit card after a few unsuccessful tries. ''We can do better than that,'' Mr. Lo said, referring to his company's Bitcoin payment solution. ''We clear faster than the banks, our transaction fee is lower than credit card companies, and there would be no chargebacks. And Bitcoin fans will flock to your bar in droves.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Mt. Gox Says It Has Found Missing Bitcoin Worth About $116 Million,"Updated, 8:04 p.m. | The seemingly miraculous discovery of about $116 million in missing Bitcoin, or 200,000 coins, late Thursday underscored the rickety early infrastructure that the digital currency is still trying to overcome. In a posting on its website in both Japanese and English, the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox announced that it had found the coins in an ''old-format wallets,'' the virtual currency equivalent of finding money in another pair of pants. In its statement from its chief executive, Mark Karpeles, the company said that after it filed for bankruptcy, it began researching the wallets that were used before June 2011. That, the company said, is when it discovered the coins, which represent about 24 percent of the coins that were missing when the site failed.  Last month, Mt. Gox said it had lost 750,000 of its Bitcoin customers' holdings and more than 100,000 of its own coins -- essentially its entire stock of Bitcoin, worth more than $450 million. The found coins are worth about $116 million based on today's rate of $578, according to the online Bitcoin index CoinDesk. ''I think that it's yet another illustration of how incompetently managed that hobbyist operation was,'' said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities who has written about Bitcoin. ''That you can lose that much Bitcoin and then find it tells you that we're not talking about robust levels of security and control.'' Mr. Luria said it was likely that Mt. Gox initially overestimated the amount of Bitcoin it had lost. Many Bitcoin supporters have said that the collapse of Mt. Gox is part of the shakeout of the early, less sophisticated Bitcoin companies that have lost ground to more well-oiled businesses. ''Where we are now is in this period of quiet transition before we see the emergence of actual exchanges,'' Mr. Luria said. ''The hobbyist operations are behind us and the robust, enterprise-grade operations are ahead of us.'' Mt. Gox, which originally started as a trading place for the card game Magic: The Gathering, was one of the first exchanges to pop up after Bitcoin mysteriously appeared online in 2009, the brainchild of an anonymous programmer or group of programmers. Mt. Gox's operations, however, were never totally transparent, and Mr. Karpeles was known as a private man who rarely showed up at public gatherings, or at meetings of the board of the Bitcoin Foundation on which he served until his resignation last month. At its peak, Mt. Gox handled about 80 percent of all Bitcoin transactions, but began losing significant ground to more sophisticated foreign exchanges like BTC-e, based in Bulgaria, and Bitstamp, in Slovenia, last year. While those companies may be helping to fuel a wider use of virtual currency, they still fall outside the grasp of American regulators. Bitcoin has no federal regulator and is not backed by a central bank. That has appealed to a core group of its more libertarian followers, but offers few options when investments turn sour, as in the case with Mt. Gox. While the Tokyo-based exchange said that it had lost its 850,000 coins, some skeptics said they thought that the coins had actually been stolen. Thieves can pilfer Bitcoin by gaining access through a computer network or taking physical material on which crucial information is stored. Coins can be stored online or offline, otherwise known as ''hot'' and ''cold'' wallets. A ''cold'' wallet can be nothing more than writing down a digital key on a scrap of paper to access one's Bitcoin, or storing the data on a thumb drive. Access to a ''hot'' wallet is through a computer network. A veritable army of Internet sleuths has been trying to track down missing Bitcoin since Mt. Gox went offline. Some users have joined a class-action lawsuit in Chicago against the exchange that is trying to keep Mr. Karpeles and his company from moving any money outside the United States. They also want a full accounting of any assets Mt. Gox has left. ''We believe that he's got a bunch of them, and we believe that he's got a bunch more,'' Jay Edelson, the plaintiffs' attorney, said in a phone interview on Friday. Mr. Edelson said that he and others believed they had traced about 200,000 coins to a pool operated by Mr. Karpeles. ''Our belief is that the reason that they supposedly found this was because they understood that we and others had already found this amount and knew that they were holding it,'' Mr. Edelson said. ''So the idea that they found it and were going to come public is exactly the opposite of what we believe happened.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
I.R.S. Takes a Position on Bitcoin: It's Property,"Updated, 8:53 p.m. | The Internal Revenue Service may have just taken some of the fun out of Bitcoin. But that may mean that the virtual currency is growing up. The I.R.S. announced on Tuesday that it would treat Bitcoin, the computer-driven online money system, as property rather than currency for tax purposes, a move that forces users who have grown accustomed to operating under the government's radar to deal with new tax issues and reporting requirements. While that may seem like an expensive headache, some financial experts view the move as a way to push Bitcoin further away from the fringes and into the mainstream financial system.  ""It's getting legitimacy, which it didn't have previously,"" said Ajay Vinze, the associate dean at at Arizona State University's business school. The ruling, he said, ""puts Bitcoin on a track to becoming a true financial asset."" While many users already treat Bitcoin like a currency, the I.R.S. made it very clear that ""it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.""  The industry had been expecting the government to come out with some sort of guidance on Bitcoin, so the announcement on Tuesday did not come as much of a surprise. But some users worry that treating it as an investment could discourage the use of Bitcoin as a payment method. If a user buys a product or service with Bitcoin, for example, the I.R.S. will expect the individual to calculate the change in value from the date the user acquired Bitcoin to the date it was spent. That would give the person a basis to calculate the gains - or losses - on what the I.R.S. is now calling property. ""People might just be tempted to hoard rather than spend, because as soon as they spend they would be liable to incur capital gains taxes,"" said Pamir Gelenbe, the co-founder of the CoinSummit conference and a partner at Hummingbird Ventures, a venture capital firm that recently invested in the online Bitcoin exchange Kraken. The I.R.S.'s decision would treat Bitcoin as property subject to capital gains taxes. Long-term capital gains taxes are capped at 20 percent, a more favorable rate than the top rate of 39.6 percent on federal income taxes. Individual traders in the currency markets - the British pound, for example - are expected to treat gains or losses as regular income for tax purposes. ""From a tax perspective, this is really the best possible outcome,"" said Barry Silbert, the chief executive of SecondMarket, which is planning to introduce a new Bitcoin exchange. Up until now, Bitcoin enthusiasts have been able to buy, sell and trade on their gains with few fees and little oversight, since the currency has no central bank and no government regulator. Over the years, the price of Bitcoin has also fluctuated wildly, from just a few cents to more than $1,000 to its current price of nearly $600. At the same time, an increasing number of merchants, including Virgin Galactic and Overstock.com, have begun accepting Bitcoin, supported by a growing cottage industry of companies who will exchange Bitcoins for dollars for a small fee. Created by an anonymous computer programmer, or group of computer programmers, Bitcoin has largely been the realm of technology enthusiasts and anti-establishment hobbyists, who often buy and sell Bitcoin on online exchanges. Programmers are also able to obtain them by ""mining,"" or figuring out obscure algorithms to ""unlock"" new coins. The I.R.S. now, however, says that these miners must report the fair market value of the virtual currency as part of their income. The new guidelines also mean that online exchanges that buy and sell Bitcoin will now have to provide customers with annual reports of their transactions, just as stock brokerages and other investment firms do. But some efforts may already be underway to ensure that the new reporting requirements will not discourage users from trading with Bitcoin. ""I can assure you that there are a number of companies that have come up with software to automate this entire process,"" Mr. Silbert said. The Bitcoin start-up Coinbase also said it supported the new guidelines. ""Exciting to see clarity from the I.R.S. Coinbase will help both consumers and merchants to meet the guidelines,"" the company said in a Twitter message. In the last year or two, however, the industry has attracted backing from venture capital and other investment firms who anticipate a wider adoption of virtual currency. But at the same time, regulators have become increasingly worried that online marketplaces could be used to facilitate drug deals and other illicit transactions. All that has put more pressure on governments around the world to figure out some way to regulate the industry. That pressure only increased last month with the collapse of one of Bitcoin's largest virtual exchanges, Mt. Gox. The company filed for bankruptcy in Japan and the United States, leaving few options for users who had lost money with the exchange. Mt. Gox claimed to have lost nearly all its 850,000 coins, although it announced last week that it found about 200,000. The I.R.S.'s guidelines might mean that users in the United States who lost money could now treat that as a capital loss on their tax forms. Bitcoin has attracted many of its users precisely because it operated outside the established financial system and offered the promise of cheaper transactions. But many Bitcoin advocates and experts have said that regulation is necessary to make Bitcoin a viable currency. ""The people that feel ideologically that Bitcoin should be free of all regulation aren't going to be happy,"" said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities who has written about virtual currency. ""If you're trying to replace an existing financial system, then you need to have all the features that are required of that financial system."" The few employers who pay in Bitcoin will have to report those wages just like any other payment made with property, and Bitcoin income will be subject to the normal federal income withholding and payroll taxes, the I.R.S. said. Shortly after the announcement, Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, praised the agency's decision. The guidance ""provides clarity for taxpayers who want to ensure that they're doing the right thing and playing by the rules when utilizing Bitcoin and other digital currencies,"" he said.  "
Mainstream Push,"While some restaurants, bars and coffee shops accept the virtual currency Bitcoin, it still exists largely in the province of speculators. One start-up, Circle Internet Financial, is trying to push Bitcoin into mainstream commerce. On Wednesday, Circle Internet announced the debut -- in limited release -- of its inaugural payments product, which it hopes will catch on among Bitcoin fans and others who are curious about the much-hyped currency. Jeremy Allaire, the founder and chief executive, said he was trying to move beyond the perception that Bitcoin was a tool merely for ''alpha male geeks.'' ''We're trying to create a metaphor which relates to how people think about their money,'' Mr. Allaire said in an interview. The product, he said, is a ''really efficient, instantaneous and secure way to send and spend and receive money.''  At the same time, Circle Internet Financial announced that it had raised $17 million in fresh capital. Its existing backers, including the technology investor Jim Breyer and the venture capital firm Accel Partners, where Mr. Breyer is a partner, participated in the financing round. Barry Silbert, the founder of SecondMarket, also invested, through his Bitcoin Opportunity Fund. The new money comes on the heels of a $9 million financing round that the company raised in October. Since then, Mr. Allaire said, he has been contacted by investors trying to get a piece of the company. While he claimed he did not need to raise more money, he said it ''allows us to have a deeper balance sheet as we go into the commercial launch phase of the business.'' The product, as described by Mr. Allaire, allows consumers to deposit dollars into an account, which converts the money into Bitcoin and stores it remotely. Users can create an account online and access their digital assets through a mobile app. They also have the ability to spend their Bitcoin at certain retailers that accept the digital currency. On a basic level, the payments system allows people to buy Bitcoin and watch its value go up or down in the account. But Mr. Allaire said the product is aimed at more than simply speculative investing. He is among a number of Bitcoin evangelists who are hoping that financial institutions, whether upstart firms or established players, step in to help create markets in Bitcoin, smoothing out its volatility. If the currency becomes more stable, he says, many more people will be willing to use it. The stakes were raised after the collapse last month of Mt. Gox, a leading Bitcoin exchange. Some Bitcoin fans characterized the exchange's demise as healthy for the currency, as other platforms would take its place. Mr. Silbert, for one, is developing a new Bitcoin exchange, and Mr. Allaire said there were more in the works. ''There are, to my knowledge, another three or four credible, institutionally focused exchange platforms that are raising venture capital and planning to launch in New York this year,'' Mr. Allaire said. His start-up, which is based in Boston, continues to attract prominent names. Leonard H. Schrank, a former chief executive of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, an industry-owned financial messaging system based in Brussels, participated in the latest financing round. Fenway Summer, a venture capital firm led by Raj Date, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who is also on the board of Circle Internet Financial, also invested. The round included a new investor, the venture capital firm Oak Investment Partners. Mr. Breyer, of Accel Partners, made his investment through his personal firm, Breyer Capital. ''The global transformation in payments made possible by Bitcoin and digital currency,'' Mr. Breyer said in a statement, ''is one of the most significant investment opportunities in the past 30 years.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Makers of Bitcoin A.T.M.s See a Not-Quite-Cashless Future,"IN addition to the Glocks and Remingtons that have long been available at Central Texas Gun Works, customers can now buy something new: Bitcoin. A bulky blue machine in the lobby of the gun store in Austin, Tex., is one of the first in the country to allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin for cash. ""I drove about 20 miles to come use the A.T.M.,"" said Mitch Frink, who took $160 out of the machine in its first week in operation. ""I wanted to be able say, 'Yeah, I sold Bitcoin for straight cash and could get it within 30 minutes.' ""  The machine, built by the Las Vegas company Robocoin, is a somewhat odd creation. If Bitcoin is aimed at moving the world toward a cashless future, how long will a cash-dispensing machine for the virtual currency last, particularly when it is more awkward to use than a traditional bank A.T.M.? Just to create an account, Robocoin users have to provide state-issued identification and a palm scan. But Robocoin's growth is recognition that, at least for the foreseeable future, even virtual currency users are going to occasionally need cold, hard cash to live in the real world. At the same time, the difficulty of turning cash into Bitcoin online has created demand for easier ways to buy virtual currencies. The allure of providing this service has drawn in several companies hoping to build a machine that will make Bitcoin available to people on the street. The most successful newcomer so far is Lamassu, run by two brothers in New Hampshire who designed a sleek, stripped-down machine. Because it takes cash for Bitcoin but does not dispense cash, it has fewer security features, making it simpler to use and cheaper to install. The machines, which cost about $5,000, have been shipped to more than 80 places around the world. Lamassu's goal is to make it as easy to buy Bitcoin as it is to buy a soda from a vending machine. All users have to do is scan the QR code - a two-dimensional type of bar code - for an existing Bitcoin wallet and insert cash. No contact is necessary with Bitcoin exchanges, which often have long account verification processes and expensive money transfer requirements. Most of Lamassu's competitors are aiming to allow users to also turn existing Bitcoin holdings into cash. A Canadian company, Bit Access, has been shipping units around the world, and Genesis Coin, a San Diego company, is introducing its first machine, the Genesis1, which it is selling for around $15,000. The Robocoin units, which are specially manufactured in Arizona, cost $20,000, but the company managed to introduce its devices before almost anyone else. The first Robocoin machine went into a coffee house in Vancouver last October. The next machines were introduced in Austin during the South by Southwest Interactive festival in March. The four units in Austin are operated by local companies that bought them from Robocoin and are responsible for keeping them stocked with cash and compliant with regulations. ""This is like going on an exchange, but with cash, in person,"" said Nick Morphis, a co-founder of CoinVault, which operates two of the machines. The process of getting cash out of the machine is somewhat complicated, even if a customer already has a Bitcoin wallet. Users first sign up for a Robocoin account by providing a phone number, a palm print and a state ID, which is scanned in. These measures keep the transactions in compliance with money-laundering regulations. After an account is set up and cash is requested, customers must wait at least 10 minutes for the transaction to be confirmed by the Bitcoin network. When the confirmation comes through, the customer receives a notification by phone and can return to the machine to pick up the cash. To pay for the service, the A.T.M. operator charges 5 percent of each transaction. After using the Robocoin unit at Central Texas Gun Works, Mr. Frink said, ""It's definitely not as quick as going to my Bank of America A.T.M. and getting cash out."" But, he added, ""Bitcoin is still in its infancy.""  "
A Revolution in Money,"Imagine it's 2040. You go to the grocery store, and when you look for the checkout counter there is none. There's no place to pay for your groceries because you already did. When you walked into the store, a sensor identified you, perhaps from a ring or watch you were wearing that transmitted the information. Or perhaps you didn't need to wear anything special. Maybe a device in the store figured out who you were using a combination of facial recognition, 3-D body shape identification and your gait. Your unique identifier is attached to your digital wallet, which transmits payment for the groceries directly to the store. But you don't pay in dollars. Your wallet has a dozen digital currencies in it, all with different values based on a variety of factors, including loyalty programs. At certain stores, you might pay with their version of frequent-flier miles. At others, you might pay with the equivalent of a virtual credit card - except the credit card isn't issued by a traditional bank.  You might also pay with credit that you received through a peer-to-peer online exchange that connects investors with people seeking short- and long-term loans. That's how you got your mortgage and financed your self-driving car, too. Welcome to the future, courtesy of the minds of some of the sharpest futurists around. The scenes just described may sound as if they came from a futuristic movie or an episode of ""The Jetsons."" Yet, that's just a middle-of-the-road view of the future; it gets wilder from here. If the last three decades revolutionized the information and telecommunications industries, the next three may upend the basic tenets of finance: currency, credit and banks, as well as payment and transmission systems. Your children may even ask you, ""What was it like to see that old-fashioned building called a bank?"" In recent years, we've already begun to see hints of an impending overhaul: the emergence of Bitcoin and the ecosystem growing around it; the adoption of peer-to-peer lending businesses like Lending Club; and the introduction of Square, the payment system, to name just a few. And even if you believe Bitcoin is no more than a fad - and that may well be, given its volatility, security issues and potential regulatory challenges - it has raised the prospect of new virtual currencies and, at the least, cheaper and more efficient transaction mechanisms. ""Money is a very interesting philosophical idea in that we have all of humanity agreeing on this system,"" said Ray Kurzweil, a futurist, inventor and author. ""So even though we may radically disagree on some things - like let's say the U.S. government and Al Qaeda - they both respect money. So it's remarkable how we have this universal respect for this very esoteric virtual construct."" Several prominent dreamers, including Marc Andreessen, who led the team that invented the first commercial web browser, say they believe that new virtual currencies will come to dominate the way we pay for things in the future. ""Bitcoin offers a sweeping vista of opportunity to reimagine how the financial system can and should work in the Internet era, and a catalyst to reshape that system,"" he wrote recently. Mr. Kurzweil, however, is not so sure how easy it will be for new currencies to emerge. ""We've built up respect for currencies associated with nations,"" he said. ""People respect dollars, mostly, I think, because of the track record, relative stability."" Other futurists suggest that there will be dozens of ways to pay for products. ""We are going to have individually issued currencies. We already have corporations issuing currency: frequent-flier miles, although people don't see them as that from a legal perspective,"" said Heather Schlegel, a futurist and social scientist who recently started a project called the Future of Money as an online documentary series supported through - what else - Kickstarter, a crowdsourced investment tool. Ms. Schlegel is hoping to explore various new payment methods, transactions and what it all means. Some of her exploration is beyond anything we can comprehend today: She considers, for example, the kind of manipulation of the subconscious that happens in the 2010 movie ""Inception"" as something that could really happen in the future. For all the promise of new currencies and transaction systems, there is a long trail of failed efforts. In 1998, a virtual currency called Beenz was introduced. Customers earned Beenz when they visited certain websites and shopped at certain online stores. It had the backing of investors like Lawrence Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle. But for all its promise, it went bust by 2001. Flooz was another currency born during the dot-com era that ended as quickly as it arrived, as did Internetcash.com. E-gold, a virtual currency backed by gold, also failed. All of them were plagued by some customers trying to use them for illicit purposes. While the future of currency may be the biggest question mark around finance, shifts in the plumbing of transactions and the future of banks may be the most transformative. What happens when you no longer need a bank to provide capital? Instead, investors and those looking for credit - individuals and businesses - meet online. Is that a real possibility? What are the regulatory ramifications? Are we more interconnected or less? Where will people store money in the future? And will it be safe? These are the questions that fill not only the minds of today's executives but also the minds of social scientists and investors in Silicon Valley. Of course, while the future may look different, it may turn out to be familiar. ""Maybe nothing is going to change, really,"" Ms. Schlegel said. ""Maybe a lot of these new concepts are going to get rolled into the dollar and the dollar will evolve slightly, because what's happening is all these new ideas will put pressure on the dollar to kind of be different."" "
Starting an Overdue Conversation About Money,"THERE is no end to the disagreements about the importance and usefulness of the upstart virtual currency Bitcoin. There is, though, no disagreement that Bitcoin's rise to a billion-dollar market has helped fuel a wide-ranging conversation on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley -- and many places in between -- about the nature of money and how it might be evolving. There have been few big changes in the infrastructure of the world's payment networks in decades. The basic elements of the credit card system have been around since the 1960s, and the mechanisms for bank transfers have been pretty much the same since the 1970s. Cash looks little different from the way it did in the 18th century.  Bitcoin is but an example of several recent technologies that are seeking to upend the way banks, regulators, merchants and consumers think about dealing in money. Creators of mobile wallets and digital tokens, such as Venmo and Square, are trying to provide faster, more seamless ways of paying bills. But few of these other new technologies are trying to change as many elements of the financial system as Bitcoin. ''The awareness of how we spend our money, and how it flows through the pipes, has totally been elevated as a result of Bitcoin,'' said Mark Williams, a professor at Boston University who has been one of the harshest critics of the virtual currency system. Perhaps the biggest challenge that virtual currencies present to the existing financial system is the speed and ease with which they can move across boundaries of all sorts. Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State's top financial regulator, who is scrutinizing the virtual currency sector, has complained in recent appearances about the time it takes for his bank to move money from his own account to pay off a credit card issued by the same bank. In the Bitcoin universe, by contrast, most transactions are confirmed and completed within 10 minutes. The current financial plumbing is a particular concern for people in countries with less-developed financial institutions, and for immigrants trying to send money over international borders. While Western Union can charge a 10 percent fee to move money to Mexico or China, Bitcoin users can make transfers free if they know what they are doing. ''There is something very powerful there in terms of allowing these kinds of international transactions with a lot less frictions and lot less cost,'' Mr. Lawsky said in a recent interview. Frustration with fees of all sorts has helped drive the interest in virtual currencies. Credit cards, for instance, generally charge merchants 2 to 3 percent of every purchase. Because Bitcoin is run by a decentralized network of computers, rather than a central company, there is essentially no charge to move money from one wallet to another. Start-ups like BitPay that handle the process for merchants currently charge around 1 percent. A Goldman Sachs analyst estimated in a March report that retailers could save $155 billion a year if they all moved to accepting only Bitcoin at current rates. Credit card fees are a particular problem for companies looking to collect small online payments for goods and services that cost less than a dollar -- the penny candy purchases of the Internet world. A number of video game companies, including Zynga and Big Fish, have recently decided to take virtual currencies because tiny payments can be made without most of the money going to fees. Even with these advantages, though, virtual currencies have real obstacles to overcome before they become as commonplace as cash. The most frequently discussed shortcoming is their price volatility. If the price of a Bitcoin could fall 10 or even 20 percent in a day -- as it has many times -- why would a merchant want to take the risk of accepting it? What's more, the lower costs of Bitcoin transactions are at least partly a result of the fact that Bitcoin companies face fewer regulations. That is changing as regulators like Mr. Lawsky look at creating rules for the industry. He held a hearing in January and is accepting applications for licenses from Bitcoin exchanges. If government authorities do create more rules for these companies, the costs may rise. And if regulators do not move in, the Bitcoin network could remain vulnerable to the hackers and fraudsters who have scared so many consumers away. But while certain types of security flaws have been a major drawback of Bitcoin, the security of the Bitcoin network has also been a major selling point. Recent revelations about the National Security Agency's classified collection of digital data -- and the theft of credit card numbers from retailers like Target -- have given ammunition to privacy advocates who think that virtual currencies can provide a more secure and private way to move money. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a common ledger, which makes all transfers traceable. But people who want to keep their Bitcoin spending private are usually able to keep their virtual currency addresses secret. Beyond the practical concerns that Bitcoin is taking on, the virtual currency is helping to fuel broad debates about the way the world's central banks currently create and manage money. Many Bitcoin advocates are fierce critics of the Federal Reserve's efforts to help the economic recovery by injecting new money into the financial system, in what is known as quantitative easing The anonymous creator of Bitcoin determined in the software that was released in 2009 that no more than 21 million coins would ever be created, hoping to stave off the inflation that has been a regular feature of the dollar. Fears that the Fed's recent policies would fuel inflation have not been borne out. In fact, many economists think the bigger threat to the economy is deflation. This has not cooled the ardor of Bitcoin aficionados, who are convinced that the world needs to move away from centralized control of the monetary system. For those who are not fans, the presence of Bitcoin has, if nothing else, held a flashlight to the financial plumbing that used to be all but invisible. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Checks Are Expendable, but in Legal Tender We Trust","THE financial industry may be fixated on virtual currencies and credit card technologies, but don't declare cash an endangered species just yet. There are now are more greenbacks coursing through the American financial system than at any time in recent history. Since January 2006, the amount of United States currency in circulation rose about 64 percent, to $1.2 trillion, showing its resiliency. But divining the future of money from the explosive growth of cash is not so easy. A 2012 annual report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco suggests that the demand for dollars may be driven not by spenders, but by hoarders. In the face of political and financial instability in recent years, consumers around the world are finding comfort in holding American dollars.  Americans aren't the only ones with an affinity for United States currency. As the European debt crisis intensified in 2010, people living abroad converted more of their euros into dollars, the San Francisco Fed noted. ""To paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the demise of cash are greatly exaggerated,"" John C. Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, wrote in an essay in the 2012 report.  That doesn't mean consumers are necessarily spending those bills. As the total amount of dollars in the system balloons, the San Francisco Fed found, signs of cash transactions are declining. Instead, consumers are using more debit and credit cards. As evidence, the report notes the number of $50 and $20 bills in circulation has grown less quickly than the overall amount of cash in the system. The San Francisco Fed paper notes that more people are likely to use the smaller bills to buy goods and services, while holding on to $100 bills for value. Such dynamics don't exactly portend a world of purely paperless money. After the financial crisis wiped out stock market investments and home values, more people and entities around the world wanted to put physical cash in safe deposit boxes and under mattresses, partly out of fear of another market collapse. ""It is very ingrained in the American psyche to have some bills in your pocket no matter how many smartphones you have,"" said Bruce Wayne Renard, executive director of the National A.T.M. Council. Memories of the 2008 crisis will eventually fade. But just as the Great Depression shaped a generation of penny pinchers, the growth in cash suggests the Great Recession may have spawned a generation of people who are attracted to cash because, unlike virtual currency, you can touch it and know it has value. In an increasingly digital world, the hallmarks of old-school retail banking have also endured. The number of A.T.M.s in the United States, for example, is largely flat, though the industry is upgrading its technology to better thwart theft. The number of bank branches is also relatively stable, even as some large banks have publicized their plans to reduce their overall retail footprints in favor of targeting more affluent markets. But in recent years, the number of bank holding companies has declined as a result of mergers and new rules that squeezed smaller banks. As a result, consumers have fewer brands and companies to choose from. Banks say customers still like to conduct some financial business, like taking out loans, in person. And banks are convinced that it is easier to sell customers additional products once they are in the door than if their transactions are limited to an iPad. The number of bank tellers is still declining, but the drop off doesn't appear as steep as it was immediately following the financial crisis, according to the Labor Department. Just about the only measure of old-school banking in steep decline is the check. Americans are writing half as many checks as they did a decade ago, as electronic payments and direct deposit become the norm for many companies and consumers. The current appeal of holding onto cash could start to wane. With interest rates near historical lows, Americans are not giving up any marginal returns by holding onto cash. But they might start to move their cash into savings and other interest-bearing accounts as rates rise, thus decreasing the amount of currency in the system. For now, though, Mr. Williams of the San Francisco Fed writes, ""Cash lives on.""  "
The Real Competition for Virtual Currency,"BITCOIN enthusiasts may want to study a satirical etching, published in 1792, that is now in a collection at London's National Portrait Gallery. In one half, titled ''French Liberty,'' an emaciated French revolutionary gnaws on raw onions. In the other, ''British Slavery,'' a corpulent Englishman feasts on a giant slab of meat. The etching's message -- that a revolution is a farce if it fails to provide the basics -- hangs uneasily over the world of virtual currencies. For Bitcoin or its peers to emerge from their niche, they have to one day provide all the crucial benefits that come with the current system of money. For now, people are forgiving of currency innovations. No one expects fledgling digital money to quickly be the equal of the status quo -- a system that has come into existence over centuries. Still, it is not clear that virtual currencies will ever have the strengths and scope of the current system, which, let's face it, functions nearly all of the time.  One big reason we have not had revolutionary forms of new money in recent times is that the current system more or less works. That was even hinted at in the seminal 2008 paper about Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto, the real or made-up name of the currency's creator or creators. ''While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model,'' the paper says. Anyone struggling to understand why digital currencies are not widely used ought to look at consumer behavior. Consumers have no problem rapidly adopting new technologies if they find them attractive. But they get a lot out of the current system. With minimal inconvenience, they can make secure noncash payments online and in stores, and they can do so around the world at any time. The existing system also allows people to store their money safely in insured banks, and those banks have the ability to create new money out of thin air when they lend to other consumers. The virtual currencies are nowhere near achieving those things, and more to the point, they often do not want to. ''As a consumer, not only am I using a real currency, I also have access to credit and access to a secure bank,'' said Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard. Over the last 30 years, the banking and payments system has not remained static. Credit and debit cards are now widely used, as are A.T.M.s and Internet banking. And the creativity continues as the widespread adoption of mobile phones has spawned easier ways to pay for things and do basic banking. In mid-April, Samsung is expected to release a phone that will allow users to buy items with a PayPal app, using only a finger swipe to verify the transaction. ''You can look forward to a world where we don't have user names and passwords,'' Hill Ferguson, chief product officer for PayPal, said. Virtual currencies are not close to offering such convenience and security on a broad scale. And it may be that the very stability of the current system is what provides the platform for inventing new products. ''Innovation happens so much faster when it happens on a strong foundation,'' Mr. McLaughlin said. Consumers did not seem to be uppermost in the minds of Bitcoin's creators. Instead, they seemed motivated mostly by a desire to reduce the cost of a payments system. Such savings would most likely benefit merchants far more than consumers. And it is not necessarily the case that virtual currencies, if they ever gain broad acceptance, will ultimately be that much cheaper. One way Bitcoin tries to keep its costs down is by using its own self-reinforced method of transaction verification. The 2008 Nakamoto paper lays out an elegant mechanism by which a potential attacker of the system would instead be induced to protect the system. ''He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favor him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth,'' the paper contends. But that mechanism may not be enough to reach the broader security of existing currencies. In recent weeks, large amounts of Bitcoin have apparently gone missing. And even if a virtual currency proves over time that its own system is secure, governments may demand wider types of compliance -- to prevent abuses like money-laundering and fraud -- that push up the costs of using it. ''There are real costs that go along with managing those risks,'' said Jim McCarthy, global head of innovation and strategic partnerships at Visa. Many supporters of virtual currencies would naturally resist government interference in their systems. At the same time, the authorities may feel uncomfortable allowing too many transactions in them, especially if they are hard to monitor. In contrast, one of the advantages of the existing system is that it has long operated within the confines of society. The dollar is embedded in America's democracy. That gives voters some say over the government entities that back, spend and print the nation's currency. Law enforcement knows it well and is able to demand that banks provide information on potential criminal activities. One of the most persuasive arguments for new currencies is that over the years, governments have had a tendency to debase and mishandle existing currencies, leading to financial instability and inflation. Some libertarians support virtual currencies because they stand apart from government interference, like a digital gold standard. But again, such aspirations show little concern for the needs of ordinary people. The current system was, after all, able to right itself after it nearly failed in 2008. The authorities prevented a grim spiral that could have pushed unemployment even higher than it was after the crisis. The efforts that brought the system back from the brink, including printing money and shoring up the banks, were made possible by the dollar's inherent flexibility and its roots in America's democracy. Virtual currencies may never have the ability to bend during times of emergency, and that may be their undoing or, at least, the reason they do not go far. The status quo is, of course, imperfect in many ways. There is a chance that some aspects of virtual currencies will be adopted by the current system, making it stronger. But as things stand today, digital money is highly unlikely to become the new status quo. Anyone hoping to feast on Bitcoin may not get anything more than raw onions. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
How to Explain Bitcoin to Your Mom!,"Think about how you earn your cash... When it comes to ordinary dollars, you have to work for your money.  Things are different in Bitcoinland. Users can buy Bitcoins or earn them by using computers to solve math equations, a process called mining. But similar to the Gold Rush of 1849, the more miners there are, the harder it becomes to mine Bitcoins. Where do you put your cash? If you have traditional money, putting it in your wallet or in a bank is a no-brainer. But you may have to explain cash transactions of $10,000 or more to comply with anti-money laundering laws. Meanwhile, in the world of Bitcoin ... Bitcoin users can also have digital wallets that exist online, or they can keep their Bitcoin ''key'' on something physical, like a piece of paper or a thumb drive. O.K. But what can I do with my Bitcoins? More merchants are taking Bitcoins, but regulators worry that some online marketplaces (like the now-defunct Silk Road operation) aid illegal transactions, like drug deals, using Bitcoins. What happens if your bank fails? For client banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will insure at least $250,000 on deposit accounts like checking and savings. What if my Bitcoins are stolen? Bitcoin, however, has no central bank or regulator. Although some start-ups are buying traditional insurance policies to reassure users, if investments go sour, there aren't a lot of options. "
"Barter, Haggle, Close, Rest","Consider these eerie similarities between Bitcoin, the supposedly cutting-edge digital currency, and the world of ''Down East Dickering,'' a History channel reality series about a throwback barter-and-haggle economy: 1. Both are rooted in an ethos that spurns government intervention and oversight. 2. Each exists in a place with a distinctive language, culture and value system. For Bitcoin, it's cyberspace. For ''Down East Dickering,'' it's Maine.  3. No one understands how either works. ''Down East Dickering'' features scruffy New Englanders, most from Maine, engaging in economic transactions for goods of dubious value: a rusting tractor, a beat-up blue 1960s school bus, an old vending machine. Sometimes an exchange involves cash; at other times, the payment is in services, like building a footbridge or providing a tow. Television has other I'll-give-you-this-for-that reality shows, of course, but a lot of them speak in a Southern lilt. The Down East accent here is by itself a refreshing change. These scraggly guys, though, are also considerably more comfortable on camera than many of their Southern cousins. Along with the Beaver Brothers -- trappers from Nova Scotia seen on an Animal Planet series of that name -- they may be the most appealing new backwoods TV characters of 2014. They also affirm that the reality-TV war has broadened into a three-cornered conflict. The Southern contingent, led by shows filmed in Louisiana, has been entrenched for years, and Alaska-Yukon shows are almost as numerous. Now the Northeast is making a run; Maine, for instance, has also brought us ''Cold River Cash'' (about eel fishermen) and ''North Woods Law'' (about game wardens). ''Down East Dickering,'' which had its premiere early this month and is seen on Wednesday nights, is a sort of free ad for a publication full of ads: Uncle Henry's Weekly Swap or Sell It Guide, in which people list junk that they're trying to sell, jobs that they're looking to have done and so on. The focus is on a group of men who apparently do little more than peruse Uncle Henry's for opportunities from which they can wring a small profit by buying and reselling, or some other form of barter. Your genial guide to this world is a hairy fellow named Tony Bennett -- yes, you read that right -- who acts as a sort of narrator and explains the finer, if indecipherable, points of dickering with phrases like ''The deal isn't done until it's done.'' Something about nontraditional economic systems seems to attract oddly named entities. Bitcoin, you'll recall, was recently tangled up in a mess involving an outfit called Mt. Gox. On ''Down East Dickering,'' the dickerers include men who go by the names Yummy, Turtle, Codfish and Captain 2-stroke. Watch this show long enough, and you begin to suspect that the dickering world consists of a finite amount of cash and a limitless amount of junk, all of it circulating among various dickerers endlessly, no one ever getting any richer or accomplishing much of consequence. Still, dickering seems to have at least as good a chance as Bitcoin does of leading us to a new economic paradigm. The next time the economy goes sour, a Commerce Department led by Secretary Yummy might be our best chance of straightening things out. "
A Bet on Bitcoin,"Despite cautions and hesitations among regulators about investing in virtual currency, the Winklevoss twins are inching closer to creating the first publicly traded Bitcoin fund. On Thursday, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the brothers most widely known for their legal battles with Facebook's co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, disclosed in a regulatory filing that they had chosen to list their Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The move comes one day after the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a warning to investors about Bitcoin, saying that it created new ''concerns'' for investors. Federal agencies have been scrambling to figure out how to regulate Bitcoin since the collapse this year of Mt. Gox, one of the most prominent exchanges for buying and selling the virtual currency.  ''A new product, technology, or innovation -- such as Bitcoin -- has the potential to give rise both to frauds and high-risk investment opportunities,'' the S.E.C. said in an alert posted to its website. ''The fact that the S.E.C. has allowed the S-1 to progress this far is an indication that it may actually happen,'' said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who has studied Bitcoin, referring to the S.E.C. regulatory filing. The Winklevoss brothers, who have emerged as two (or perhaps one) of the most public faces of Bitcoin, first applied to create the exchange-traded fund, called the Winklevoss Bitcoin trust, last summer. The goal is to provide investors of any size with an easy way to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, the volatile virtual currency that has gained momentum over the past several years. They have invested in Bitcoin companies, including the exchange BitInstant, and at one point owned more than $64 million of virtual currency itself. In February, the twins started the Winkdex, their own index to measure the price of Bitcoin, to work in conjunction with their proposed Bitcoin E.T.F. According to the Winkdex, a single Bitcoin was worth $443 on Thursday afternoon. Coindesk, a more widely cited index, pegged the figure at $437. The Winklevoss's proposed fund would buy one Bitcoin for every five shares. The company the two operate, Math-Based Asset Services, would be in charge of storing the fund's Bitcoin holdings. The company has not yet decided how much its management fee will be. A single Bitcoin was worth only a few cents when it first appeared online in 2009, largely backed by a small number of technology enthusiasts and cryptocurrency hobbyists. The wider adoption by both consumers and technology entrepreneurs helped the price skyrocket to more than $1,000 at one point last year. But until recently, investors had few options for speculating on that price change. The currency, which can be bought and sold among users or ''unlocked'' by solving complicated mathematical riddles, has no central regulator or bank. Buying Bitcoins also comes with the hassle of storing Bitcoins, which can involve physically securing a virtual ''key.'' But the Winklevoss twins want to give investors an easier way into the market. Like SPDR, the widely used gold E.T.F., for example, investors would be able to invest in Bitcoin without having to actually buy and store the virtual currency. ''Our goal with this whole thing was to make it as similar to the gold E.T.F. as possible,'' Cameron Winklevoss said in an interview. ''We're trying to reduce the friction of purchasing Bitcoin and securing it.'' But Mr. Luria sees Bitcoin's wide price fluctuations as a risk for investors. Bitcoin isn't the only commodity that trades 24 hours a day, but it does have wilder price shifts than many other assets. ''The price could decrease tremendously after the market closes, and you won't be able to do anything about it,'' Mr. Luria said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Election Commission Votes to Allow Bitcoin Donations,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Election Commission on Thursday voted to allow political committees to accept Bitcoin donations and outlined the ways that the virtual currency can be used by federally regulated campaigns. Responding to a request from a political action committee, the commissioners unanimously approved an advisory opinion that defined Bitcoins, which allows for online transactions without going through a bank or other third party, as ''money or anything of value'' -- in essence, cash or an in-kind contribution. They also imposed some restrictions, ruling that Bitcoin donations will be capped at a cash equivalent of $100 per person per cycle, with the value determined at the time of the donation, and that a complete accounting of name, address and employer must accompany the donation.  Committees can liquidate a Bitcoin contribution immediately, or they can choose to keep it as an investment, in the same way they do with stocks and bonds. Since the value of the virtual currency can fluctuate suddenly, the opportunity for a windfall is real, but is growing rarer as it stabilizes. The opinion also allows committees to buy Bitcoins on the open market, but prohibits them from using the coins to pay for goods or services. They must be liquidated into United States currency before being spent. ''Clearly, for me it's significant that the requester has only asked for $100 in Bitcoin contributions,'' said Ann M. Ravel, the vice chairwoman of the commission. ''And so it is good that we can give some guidance to the community in respect to that amount of money that is not going to raise some of the bigger issues that might come with Bitcoin transactions.'' Lee Goodman, the commission's chairman, released a separate statement explaining why he voted yes and laying out the remaining issues. In the end, he wrote, he supported the opinion because it ''lays a foundation for the use of Bitcoins specifically and new technologies generally within the commission's well established regulatory framework.'' The ruling is both an acknowledgment of the currency's growing popularity and a move to protect against efforts to circumvent campaign finance laws. Bitcoins can be difficult to trace, potentially opening the gates to both illegal and foreign money. Although the opinion provides some clarity for campaign committees, it is not likely to lead to a deluge of Bitcoin donations. ''Besides the compliance burden, it's an invitation for a headache,'' said David Mitrani, an associate at Sandler Reiff Lamb Rosenstein & Birkenstock in Washington who specializes in federal and state campaign finance law. ''It's creating more work where potentially you wouldn't have to create more work.'' But, he added, ''should a committee really wish to accept Bitcoin, the F.E.C. has actually laid out a clear path to do so.'' Still, the introduction of a new source of financing could be important to some smaller campaigns and committees, especially those with significant backing from libertarians, who have embraced the currency. The Libertarian Party has already built a small but loyal Bitcoin donor base, receiving $10,000 to $20,000 a year in the currency. Bitcoin had occupied a gray area in campaign finance after the commission deadlocked on a ruling in November. No current federal law or regulation prohibits virtual currencies in campaigns. Representative Steve Stockman, a Texas Republican and a Bitcoin enthusiast, accepted Bitcoin contributions to his primary campaign against Senator John Cornyn this year. Greg Abbott, a Republican candidate for governor in Texas, announced last month that he would be accepting Bitcoins, and he already has a few in his campaign war chest. And Representative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, announced after the ruling that he would begin accepting Bitcoins for his re-election campaign. ''Our campaign has focused on making use of cutting-edge tools to communicate online and has made digital a priority from the start,'' said Matt Hirsch, Mr. Abbott's communications director. ''Something as innovative as Bitcoins is an opportunity for us to continue this focus, particularly given the fact that it embodies free market principles, which Texans are very fond of.'' Other politicians see accepting Bitcoin donations as part of a grander message. ''In the broadest sense possible, it's a democratic currency,'' said Bryan Parker, a candidate for mayor in Oakland, Calif. ''I want all people to have the chance to participate. For me, it says by being open to other payment systems, it says you're open to innovation.'' Those in the political technology sector have also been preparing for the introduction of Bitcoins into the political sphere. Targeted Victory, a digital strategy firm that does work for Republicans, helped the Abbott campaign set up its Bitcoin operation. NGP VAN, a technology company for Democratic and liberal candidates, has developed a Bitcoin integration for its applications and had been waiting for further guidance from the election commission before releasing it. And CoinVox, a start-up founded to enable the use of Bitcoins in politics, has already received interest from federal candidates. The ruling did not specifically allow or prohibit unlimited Bitcoin donations by ''super PACs,'' and the rules are expected to continue to develop along with the infant currency. "
Dish Network Says It Will Accept Bitcoin,"Most of Dish Network's 14 million subscribers are probably not Bitcoin users. But that will not stop the company from accepting payments in the virtual currency later this year. Dish announced on Thursday that customers would be able to make manual payments in Bitcoin beginning in the third quarter. And while Dish may not be the first company to accept Bitcoin, it claims to be the largest -- though the appeal of the payment option is still unclear. ''We don't know what the demand will be, exactly,'' Bernie Han, Dish's chief operating officer, said in an interview on Thursday. ''It might be tiny. It might be bigger than tiny. It's probably growing.''  In fact, Bitcoin's biggest appeal may be its ability to attract new customers. As enthusiasts try to push virtual currency further into the mainstream, digital money may offer companies cutting-edge appeal. ''Accepting Bitcoin is about all these things -- marketing, branding and acquiring new types of customers,'' said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. ''I don't think there are a lot of customers asking Dish for Bitcoin by name, but that doesn't mean Dish won't get some new customers now that they accept Bitcoin because those customers see Dish as a friendlier, more forward-thinking brand.'' Retailers like Overstock.com and Virgin America already accept virtual currency, helped by new services that aim to make digital money easier to use. One such company is Coinbase, which began with $25 million from the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz. Coinbase acts as a third-party payment processor, converting customers' Bitcoins into dollars. ''We're excited to support Dish and their current and new subscribers for their Bitcoin transactions,'' Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase, said in a statement. ''This is a large step forward in the growing momentum of customers paying companies in Bitcoin for things we do every day, like watching premium TV.'' But that does not mean those companies are seeing a flood of Bitcoins. Less than 1 percent of Overstock's sales are made in Bitcoin, according to the company's most recent quarterly filing. Users acquire Bitcoins by buying them from one another on online exchanges or by solving complicated mathematical equations to ''mine'' new coins. When it first appeared in 2009, Bitcoin offered a cheaper payment system that allowed people to bypass the banking industry. Since then, its following has expanded beyond technology enthusiasts and anti-establishment types to include more mainstream users. That soon attracted entrepreneurs looking to start new businesses and capitalize on a growing market. But the wider adoption has also drawn increased scrutiny to Bitcoin's volatility and regulation. The price of a Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly, from a few cents in the beginning to more than $1,000 at its peak. Its current price is about $565, according to the online index CoinDesk. In February, Mt. Gox, a once-dominant online exchange for the virtual currency, collapsed amid a swirl of speculation that hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Bitcoin had been stolen. The collapse, and the subsequent closure of the online marketplace Silk Road, prompted a scramble among regulators to impose rules that would protect consumers and prevent future illicit activity. But virtual-currency enthusiasts have said that the closing of some of Bitcoin's early institutions could be a good thing. There may now be more room, they say, for sophisticated businesses to help Bitcoin gain a wider following, including from established companies like Dish. ''It's another big milestone,'' Mr. Luria said of Dish's announcement. ''This is a mainstream company with mainstream leadership that's decided to embrace Bitcoin and what Bitcoin technology offers.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
King's College in New York to Accept Bitcoin,"Bitcoin can already be used to purchase a plane ticket, donate to a political campaign and pay a satellite TV bill. Beginning this fall, it can also be used to pay for a college education.  On Friday, King's College, a four-year evangelical school based in Lower Manhattan, said that it would become the first accredited college to allow students to pay their tuition in Bitcoin. It's also the latest in a growing list of groups that have begun accepting virtual currency, fueled by a cottage industry dedicated to making online money easier to use.  A small liberal arts college committed to ""the truths of Christianity and a biblical worldview,"" King's charges $15,950 a semester for 12 to 18 credits, according to its website. King's has about 500 students, according to the school's president, Gregory Thornbury.  But Mr. Thornbury does not know how many of those students, or future students, will actually take advantage of the new payment method. That's not surprising, given that many merchants say that just offering Bitcoin as an option can be a useful marketing tool. Mr. Thornbury said that the school was primarily motivated by the desire to be forward-thinking. ""It seems to be fairly similar to email 20 years ago,"" Mr. Thornbury said in an interview Friday. ""Why would we need that? And then everybody has one."" Bitcoin, the computer-driven currency created by an anonymous programmer, has steadily gained a toehold in the mainstream since it appeared online in 2009. While established financial institutions have thus far shunned it amid fears about future regulation, a number of venture capital firms have jumped at the chance to capitalize on what they see as a growing market.  But critics contend that investors should be wary of Bitcoin because of the potential for scams and its volatility. Federal prosecutors shut down Silk Road, the popular Bitcoin marketplace, after accusing it of facilitating drug deals and other illegal transactions. And several regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, have recently sent out alerts to warn consumers about fraudulent investment schemes. Bitcoin's price has swung from a few cents to more than $1,000 to its current price of about $600 in just a few years.  Still, plenty of entrepreneurs are eager to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Companies like Coin.co and the more widely used Coinbase have made it easier for companies to accept Bitcoin by converting virtual currency into dollars. Coinbase already works with companies including Overstock.com and recently confirmed it would help Jared Polis, a congressman from Colorado, accept campaign donations. Just last month, Dish Network announced it would use Coinbase to let customers pay their satellite television bills.                        "
Bitcoin Security Firm BitGo Raises $12 Million,"The Bitcoin security platform BitGo announced on Monday that it had raised $12 million, the latest example of how investors see opportunity in a growing industry aimed at making virtual currency easier and safer to use.  BitGo, which sells a security platform to protect Bitcoin against theft and loss, said it had raised the money from investors including the Silicon Valley investment capital firm Redpoint Ventures; Bitcoin Opportunity Corporation, a Bitcoin investment vehicle run by the entrepreneur Barry Silbert; and Ashton Kutcher's A-Grade Investments. Bitcoin, the computer-driven online currency, has no central regulator and is not secured by a national bank, meaning that investors have little recourse if their Bitcoin is lost or stolen. This lack of security has spurred the growth of a cottage industry aimed at providing protection to Bitcoin, thereby bringing it further into the mainstream.  In some ways, those efforts have succeeded, as more and more merchants have begun accepting Bitcoin as payment. But online money still faces regulatory and technological hurdles. It is still not widely used, and law enforcement agencies are wary of its potential for abuse. Investors are also concerned about security, especially in the wake of the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the dominant online exchange for buying and selling Bitcoin. The company went dark nearly overnight last February and announced that more than 700,000 Bitcoins had been lost, leaving users with few options to recover their money. Jeff Brody, a founding partner at Redpoint, said that wary Bitcoin investors need the same assurances that VerSign brought to e-commerce at the dawn of the Internet age, when users were first introduced to entering their banking data online.   ""Until VeriSign came along and offered the certificate authority and infrastructure, that was a pretty difficult and dangerous thing to do,"" Mr. Brody said on Monday. ""We think that Bitcoin needs the same thing."" BitGo, based in Silicon Valley, says that it can protect users' Bitcoin through a proprietary ""multisignature"" system - the equivalent of issuing multiple user ""keys"" that are required to unlock a Bitcoin account, much like a safe deposit box at a bank.  BitGo doesn't want to just appeal to individual virtual currency speculators, however. The company says it wants to appeal to hedge funds, large corporations and other firms that may want to invest in Bitcoin, but need sophisticated security assurances to do so. ""If users can't trust that their holdings are secure, or that they can't transact securely, then Bitcoin will never take off,"" said Will O'Brien, BitGo's chief executive. ""Our focus is on making Bitcoin secure for commercial transactions.""                       "
List of Potential Bitcoin Bidders Is Accidentally Released,"A musician, a college professor and the head of public policy for Yelp could all bid on 30,000 Bitcoins being auctioned by United States Marshals Service this month, according to a list that was accidentally leaked by the office on Wednesday. According to CoinDesk, an online website devoted to Bitcoin, the list of people who inquired about the auction include an ""artist and musician"" named Shem Booth, a business professor from Rowan University, Barry Silbert, the head of the online exchange SecondMarket, and Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of Coinbase, a Bitcoin payment processor.  CoinDesk said that the United States Marshals Service had accidentally released the names in an email to update interested parties on the auction's guidelines. A spokeswoman for the Marshals, Lynzey Donahue, released a statement confirming that the office had accidentally made the email addresses public, but did not confirm for whom. ""The message was intended to blind copy everyone with an attached document that contained frequently asked questions and answers on the subject,"" Ms. Donahue said. ""The U.S.M.S. apologizes for this mistake, which was in no way intentional."" Some of the names on the list were not surprising. Mr. Silbert had already announced that he planned to create an investment vehicle to participate in the auction. Coinbase, which converts Bitcoin into dollars, may see the auction as an opportunity to buy Bitcoin on the cheap that it could then resell to its vast network of users A spokesman for Coinbase could not immediately be reached for comment. Indeed, many of the people who ultimately bid may be interested for similar reasons, according to Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. Mr. Luria speculated that several of the potential bidders, which include lawyers and investment groups, could be acting on behalf of a pool of investors who want to get their hands on Bitcoin below its current price of about $600. The list of interested parties, which also includes Luther Lowe, the director of public policy for Yelp,  may not be complete. Notably absent is Pantera Bitcoin, the new virtual currency fund that has backing from investors including the investment firm Fortress Investment Group. Pantera is participating in the auction, according to Dan Morehead, who founded Pantera Bitcoin's parent company, Pantera Capital, in 2003. Mr. Lowe said that he had inquired about the auction as a ""private investor,"" and not on behalf of Yelp, according to an update to Coindesk's story. United States Marshals office seized the 30,000 Bitcoins when it shut down Silk Road, the now-defunct virtual currency marketplace that federal prosecutors accused of facilitating drug deals and other illicit transactions. The coins are currently worth about $18 million, and represent less than 1 percent of the roughly 13 million currently in circulation. Some virtual currency enthusiasts have raised concerns that the Marshals' auction could affect the value of the  digital money,  especially given that Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly since it was first introduced in 2009. But Mr. Luria, the analyst, said he did not expect the price of Bitcoin to change significantly after the auction. ""I think the market has had enough time to digest the supply that's coming on board,"" he said. The auction began on Monday, and the Marshal's office will notify winning bidders at the end of the month. Only 21 million Bitcoins exist in total, and several are released every few minutes through a process known as ""mining."" Users unlock Bitcoins by solving complex, computer-driven algorithms. Created by an anonymous computer programmer, or group of programmers, Bitcoin has quickly been gaining popularity, even though it has not yet found a mainstream footing. The fledgling industry has attracted a growing list of investors banking on the wider adoption of virtual currency, even as enthusiasts continue to face  technological and regulatory challenges. "
U.S. Prepares for Auction of Bitcoins Seized in Silk Road Raid,"On its face, it looked like a typical government raid: Federal agents shut down an online drug marketplace, seizing millions of dollars of ill-gotten gains in the process. But there was just one problem. The money was in Bitcoin. And since last fall, the government has been trying to figure out how it can sell it for the maximum amount. The federal government is responsible for selling property taken from criminals, including cars, yachts and fine jewelry. But Bitcoin, a computer-driven virtual currency that exists entirely online, is neither fish nor fowl. If the government dumped all the coins on the open exchanges where Bitcoins are bought and sold, it could significantly depress their price.  So instead, with help from the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, the United States Marshals Service has arranged an online auction for nearly 30,000 of the Bitcoins it seized from the now-defunct market Silk Road, which federal prosecutorsshut in October and have accused of aiding the sale of cocaine, ecstasy and other illegal goods and services. ""Selling Bitcoin with its somewhat liquid market is not the same as auctioning off a 1998 Chevy with a couple of bullet holes in the driver's door,"" Steven Englander, a research analyst with Citigroup, wrote in a note on Wednesday. Experts are divided on whether an auction of that many Bitcoins, which represent a substantial percentage of the average daily trading volume, will push the price down anyway. Furthermore, the auction's setup has been an opaque and, at times, slapdash process. A list of potential bidders was accidentally released on June 18 in an email from the agency, which had said that it would not release any information about the bidders or winning bids. ""The U.S. marshal specifically has never had to auction off this type of asset,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who has studied Bitcoin. ""They're figuring it out for the first time, and maybe that's why the process hasn't been completely transparent."" The government has provided some details about the process. Bidders will have a 12-hour window on Friday to submit one sealed bid for the coins, which have been broken up into lots of 3,000. The winners will be notified on Monday. Only about 20 percent of the Bitcoins that were seized from Silk Road will be auctioned, providing a test run if the government decides to sell the rest. The authorities are also concerned with Bitcoin's potential to be used for illegal activity, and the agency screened potential bidders. Bidders had to prove their identities and that they had at least $200,000 in cash. They also had to certify that they were not affiliated with Silk Road or its founder, Ross Ulbricht. But for bidders, the auction process was less transparent. Questions about the auction from would-be bidders were answered only in writing by a general email inbox. And apparent typographical errors in the initial instructions posted on the Marshals Service's website made it unclear when the registration deadlines were. Some bidders also said other aspects of the process had been vague. Drew Wade, a spokesman for the Marshals Service, said: ""There are necessary privacy and security measures that the Marshals Service has to take."" He continued: ""In particular, cases involving complex assets."" The problems, particularly the accidental release of names, could affect how much money the government raises from what it hoped would be an efficient auction. In the days after the leak, people on the recipient list exchanged emails with one another, turning what should have been an anonymous communication into an open forum. ""The leak has definitely changed the dynamics,"" said Charles Allen, the chief executive of the Bitcoin Shop, whose name was on the list. The mistake also spurred unease among recipients of the message, he added. ""People have been very concerned about their privacy,"" Mr. Allen said. The leaked list included prominent names in the Bitcoin world like the payment processor Coinbase and the entrepreneur Barry Silbert, which could scare off smaller bidders from participating, some experts said. On the flip side, it could also entice other wealthy investors who do not want to sit on the sidelines. ""Either this was a very clever piece of disinformation or a very careless error by the government. It's a little hard to which from a distance,"" David L. Yermack, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, said of the leak. ""You want to create the illusion that there's immense demand for this if you're the government because you want people to bid as much as they're willing to."" The Marshals Service made it clear publicly that the leak was unintentional. Bitcoin, created by an anonymous computer programmer, or group of programmers, at the height of the financial crisis, appealed to an anti-establishment following that liked the idea of avoiding the banking system and government regulation. Users can either buy Bitcoins from one another or ""unlock"" them by solving complicated mathematical algorithms. Since Bitcoin first appeared online in 2009, the price has fluctuated wildly, from a few pennies to over a thousand dollars at its peak. The original programmers intended to create a finite number of Bitcoins, which could make acquiring large quantities difficult. Over the years, however, Bitcoin has reached a broader audience thanks to the public backing of technologists, venture capitalists financing Bitcoin enterprises and retailers accepting payment in Bitcoin. It is that audience the Marshals Service hopes to tap in its auction. Because of some of the missteps and the unprecedented nature of the auction, estimating how much the government will raise is difficult. The Marshals Service often conducts sealed-bid sales, but auction experts say that can discourage bidders from participating. Some bidders said their strategy relied more on game theory than financial analysis. But game theory, in which players size up one another knowing that their opponents are doing the same, is much harder when the game is kept a secret. Because participants in the auction will not know the size of the bidding pool, they are likely to bid cautiously, said Lawrence M. Ausubel, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland and an auction theory expert. Another theory, however, says bidders may be willing to pay a premium to acquire a big lot of Bitcoins. Mr. Silbert, the entrepreneur who runs a Bitcoin investment fund through his firm SecondMarket, said his bid would be determined by the bids from his clients, who were participating as part of a consortium. ""We have no discretion,"" Mr. Silbert said. ""We are bidding based on where all the bids come in into our syndicate."" Because of Bitcoin's volatility and lack of historical data, it is difficult to compare the auction of Bitcoin to the auction of Treasury bonds, or other financial instruments that trade openly. At the same time, Bitcoin's price - it currently trades around $600 - will anchor Friday's bids to some degree. ""If it's a Picasso, or if it's an oil field where basically you don't know what the correct price is, you might say that the Picasso is anywhere from a million to 10 million,"" Mr. Englander said in an interview. ""It's not like a Treasury bond, where you could get the price to four decimal places.""                       "
"After Bitcoin Auction, Winning Bidders Remain Elusive","Since Friday, when the United States Marshals Service auctioned off nearly 30,000 Bitcoins, investors and Bitcoin enthusiasts alike have been eagerly awaiting the results. As the agency began notifying winning and losing participants late on Monday afternoon, many in the Bitcoin world were still trying to figure out who won and the what they paid. Some prominent bidders were left scratching their heads. ""The U.S. government auction created a tremendous amount of new demand for Bitcoin,"" said Dan Morehead, who bid through Pantera Bitcoin, largely considered a front-runner in the auction. ""Most of the people we spoke to were new entrants to the Bitcoin market.""  He added: ""None of our bids were hit. I think it went at quite a high price.""  Barry Silbert, who runs a Bitcoin investment fund through his firm SecondMarket, said on Twitter that his syndicate, which received 186 bids from 42 bidders, had been outbid on all blocks. The United States Marshals Service, with help from the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, arranged the online auction for 29,656 of the Bitcoins seized from the now-defunct market Silk Road. The site was shut in October and has been accused of aiding the sale of illegal goods and services. Bidders had a 12-hour window on Friday to submit one sealed bid for the coins, which had been broken up into lots of 3,000. The Marshals Service said on Monday that 45 registered bidders participated in the event, and that the agency received 63 bids over the course of the auction. Beyond that, the agency has said from the beginning of the auction process that it will not reveal the names of the winning bidders or the amount of the winning bids. The Marshals Service declined to comment further on Monday because the award process was ongoing.  Still, some names of bidders have trickled out, including Coinbase, a Bitcoin payment processor; Rangeley Capital, a value investment fund; and Alex Waters, the chief executive and co-founder of CoinApex, a Bitcoin-focused start-up.  Even as the names of those who submitted bids became public, most bidders remained largely tight-lipped about their bids. Chris DeMuth Jr., a partner at Rangeley Capital, said he had bid below the market price, but, like most participants thus far, would not comment on his exact bid.  ""It's more about the process and the potential for the price than it is about anything intrinsic to the Bitcoins,"" Mr. DeMuth said. He said he was outbid.  As of Monday evening, DealBook had not yet determined the winner or winners of the auction. Since the auction closed, the price of Bitcoin has climbed to about $639 as of Monday evening, up from about $570 when the auction began, according to CoinDesk. But experts were divided on whether the spike in price provided any indication about the bids. After the auction closed, some bidders were in communication with each other, and a jump in price could indicate that they were driving up the price, said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who has studied Bitcoin.  Bidders ""probably have more information than the market does, and that could explain why the market is up,"" he said. The price fluctuation is also within the normal range for Bitcoin, he added.  The increase in price could also have been a red herring, said Steven Englander, a research analyst with Citigroup. ""People who bid and who are successful in their bidding obviously would like the market to think that the price was high rather than low,"" he said. Mr. Waters of CoinApex, who bid as an individual, appeared to send his bid using his cellphone while live on Bloomberg Television on Friday, but later confessed in an interview that he had forgotten to attach the bidding form to his email. He submitted his bid for one block of Bitcoins, at a price of $403 each, later on Friday afternoon. He, too, did not win.  ""I was anticipating a lot of the other bidders getting disqualified because it seemed to me that the Marshals Service didn't want syndicates bidding,"" Mr. Waters said, referring to the agency's intense screening process. ""It was sort of just a fun thing. I took a gamble."" "
Single Winner of All Bitcoins in U.S. Auction,"The United States Marshals Service announced on Tuesday that one bidder had won all of the nearly 30,000 Bitcoins auctioned on Friday. ""The U.S. Marshals Bitcoin auction resulted in one winning bidder,"" Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the Marshals Service, said in a statement. ""The transfer of the Bitcoins to the winner was completed today,""   But Marshals Service did not identify the winner or disclose the winning bid. In instructions on its website and to bidders, the Marshals Service had said it would alert both winners and losers of the auction on Monday by 5 p.m. Eastern time. The deadline for winning bidders to transfer funds to the agency, according to the website, was Tuesday by 5 p.m. At least a handful of bidders were sent emails on Monday notifying them that they had not won the auction. So far, many prominent bidders have said they were outbid, including a syndicate run by SecondMarket, Pantera Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Shop and Coinbase. Rangeley Capital and Alex Waters at CoinApex also said they did not win any Bitcoins. ""While we are disappointed that our syndicate did not emerge as a winner in the auction, we are pleased to see such strong interest from other bidders,"" Barry Silbert of SecondMarket said in a statement on Monday. ""The auction was a clear success and the result quite positive for Bitcoin."" Mr. Silbert said his syndicate had received 186 bids from 42 bidders. The Marshals Service said on Monday that 45 registered bidders had participated in the event and that the agency had received 63 bids over the course of the auction.  Since the Marshals Service first announced the auction in early June, there have been a number of missteps. A list of potential bidders was accidentally released on June 18 in an email from the agency. And apparent typographical errors in the initial instructions posted on the Marshals Service's website made it unclear when the registration deadlines were.  Some bidders also said other aspects of the process had been vague. Mr. Waters, for example, said on Monday that he had bid on one block of 3,000 Bitcoins at $403 each, far below the market price of Bitcoin, because he thought syndicates would not be permitted by the Marshals Service. The price of Bitcoin continued to climb on Tuesday, reaching a high of nearly $655, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, up from about $639 on Monday. At the start of the auction, the price of Bitcoin was about $570.  The United States Marshals Service, with help from the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, arranged the online auction for 29,656 of the Bitcoins seized from the now-defunct market Silk Road.

Venture Capitalist Tim Draper Wins Bitcoin Auction,"The venture capitalist Tim Draper was the sole winning bidder of the nearly 30,000 Bitcoins auctioned on Friday by the United States Marshals Service, several people close to the auction said on Wednesday.   Avish Bhama, the co-founder and chief executive of the Bitcoin exchange Vaurum, said in an email that Mr. Draper was the auction winner and that he had teamed up with Vaurum to provide Bitcoin liquidity to emerging markets. ""Vaurum has launched trading platforms in emerging markets, and we will be partnering with Tim to leverage the pool of 30,000 bitcoins as a liquidity source,"" Mr. Bhama wrote. ""It's still quite difficult to get access to Bitcoin in these developing economies - and that's exactly where it is needed the most."" Mr. Draper could not immediately be reached for comment, but he provided a statement through Mr. Bhama. ""Bitcoin frees people from trying to operate in a modern market economy with weak currencies.  With the help of Vaurum and this newly purchased bitcoin, we expect to be able to create new services that can provide liquidity and confidence to markets that have been hamstrung by weak currencies,"" Mr. Draper said in the statement. ""Of course, no one is totally secure in holding their own country's currency.  We want to enable people to hold and trade bitcoin to secure themselves against weakening currencies."" The Marshals Service announced on Tuesday that one bidder had won all the Bitcoins, though it did not identify the winner or disclose the winning bid. Barry Silbert, the chief executive of SecondMarket, who participated in the auction using a syndicate but did not win, also said that Mr. Draper had won the auction. The Marshals Service, with help from the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, arranged the online auction for 29,656 of the Bitcoins seized from the now-defunct market Silk Road.

Winner of Bitcoin Auction Plans to Expand Currency's Use,"Updated, 8:28 p.m. | When the government auctioned nearly 30,000 Bitcoins on Friday, many bidders were looking for a bargain, hoping to buy the virtual currency at a discount and flip it later for a short-term profit. But the winner, the venture capitalist Tim Draper, is not seeking a quick hit. Instead, through a partnership with the Bitcoin exchange start-up Vaurum, Mr. Draper intends to make the coins available for use in emerging markets.  ''With the help of Vaurum and this newly purchased Bitcoin, we expect to be able to create new services that can provide liquidity and confidence to markets that have been hamstrung by weak currencies,'' Mr. Draper said in a statement through Vaurum. ''We want to enable people to hold and trade Bitcoin to secure themselves against weakening currencies.'' The United States Marshals Service, which organized the auction of the coins seized from the now-defunct market Silk Road, confirmed on Wednesday that Mr. Draper won the auction. The Marshals Service announced on Tuesday that one bidder had won all the coins, but it did not identify the winner or disclose the winning bid. Avish Bhama, the co-founder and chief executive of Vaurum, said the goal was not to dump the 30,000 coins on the open market. Rather, he said that he and Mr. Draper hoped to expand Bitcoin's use in areas of the world where access to the currency is difficult, including India, South America and parts of Asia. ''This is a very long-term thesis that we have where we want to increase the supply and facilitate the usage of Bitcoin in emerging economies,'' Mr. Bhama said. Mr. Draper was part of a group that invested $4 million in Vaurum in May. The company participated in a start-up accelerator program, Boost VC, run by Mr. Draper's son Adam Draper. The Marshals Service said on Monday that 45 registered bidders had taken part in the auction and that the agency had received 63 bids. A number of prominent names in the Bitcoin world, including Barry Silbert of SecondMarket, Pantera Bitcoin and Coinbase, submitted unsuccessful bids. Interest in the auction is the latest indication that Bitcoin is gaining popularity. When it first appeared online in 2009, Bitcoin, created by an anonymous computer programmer, or group of programmers, appealed mostly to an anti-establishment following that wanted to avoid the banking system and government regulation. Like Mr. Draper, many entrepreneurs now see an opportunity, particularly in making financial transactions easier. ''The venture capital community very much believes that there is a future in the implementation of Bitcoin technology,'' said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has studied Bitcoin. ''Having a stake in Bitcoin supports this vision of Bitcoin as helping create tools in emerging markets for consumers that don't have access to the traditional banking network.'' The price of Bitcoin has climbed since the auction closed, reaching a high of about $655 on Tuesday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. The price fell slightly on Wednesday, to about $645. At the start of the auction, the price was about $570. Mr. Bhama declined to disclose Mr. Draper's bid for the stash of coins, which is now worth about $19 million. Mr. Draper could not be reached for further comment. Experts are divided on what information about Mr. Draper's bid, if any, can be gleaned from the price increase. Losing bidders may be driving up the price because they know there is significant demand for the coins at a higher price. The increase could also be the result of interest in the auction itself, said David L. Yermack, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. ''Just the fact that there was such broad demand would tend to push up the value of Bitcoin,'' he said. For the Marshals Service, which is responsible for selling property taken from criminals like cars and yachts, the auction was unfamiliar territory and was not without missteps. A list of potential bidders was accidentally released on June 18 in an email from the agency. And apparent typographical errors in the initial instructions posted on the Marshals Service's website made it unclear when the registration deadlines were. Participants also said the auction process was vague, which experts said might have discouraged smaller parties from bidding. Bidders had a 12-hour window to submit one sealed offer for the coins, which have been broken up into lots of 3,000. Only about 20 percent of the coins that were seized from Silk Road were auctioned on Friday, and the auction could provide a road map for the Marshals Service if it decides to sell the rest. The Marshals Service said on Wednesday that it did not publicly discuss its internal auction processes. Regardless, experts said the fact that one participant bid high enough to take home all the coins was evidence that the auction had been a success. ''They probably don't regret this one bit,'' Mr. Yermack said. ''It's probably viewed as a stroke of good fortune.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Dell Begins Accepting Bitcoin,"Another well-known company is embracing digital money. On Friday, Dell announced that customers would be able to make purchases on its website using Bitcoin, claiming to become the biggest retailer yet to accept the virtual currency. ""We put this together quickly as a result of listening to our customers,"" said David Frink, a Dell spokesman. ""It's another way for customers to have a relationship with Dell."" When retailers first started accepting Bitcoin, the appeal was largely the currency's ability to attract new customers with its novelty. But as Bitcoin has become more mainstream, merchants may now be embracing digital money to lower payment processing fees and make purchases  easier for already-loyal customers.  ""Retailers have very low margins, and online especially, and they're in a constant battle with credit cards and banks to lower those fees,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.  ""Now that they see this avenue for fees to go away, that's really their big motivation."" To make accepting Bitcoin possible, Dell teamed up with Coinbase, a third-party payment processor that converts customers' Bitcoins into dollars. Coinbase, which began with $25 million from the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, first approached Dell about accepting Bitcoin as a payment option a few months ago, said Adam White, the director of business development and strategy at Coinbase, who worked with Dell on the partnership. Dell reached  out to Coinbase two weeks ago about adopting Bitcoin quickly, in time for back-to-school shopping, he said. ""Merchants are really waking up and seeing just how powerful using Bitcoin as a payment option is,"" Mr. White said. ""Adding Dell to our roster of merchants that accepts Bitcoin is a great signal for the industry that Bitcoin is here to stay."" Dell, which offers products ranging from personal computers to tablets and printers, had annual sales of nearly $60 billion in 2013. Companies working with Coinbase pay it a 1 percent processing fee after the first $1 million in sales.  About 35,000 merchants use Coinbase's payment tools, Mr. White said, including Overstock.com, which teamed up with Coinbase in early January. The online travel booking website Expedia and the satellite television provider Dish Network have also started accepting Bitcoin. Despite a more widespread adoption of Bitcoin, it's not clear how many customers are using the currency to pay for goods and services. In its most recent quarterly filing, Overstock said that less than 1 percent of its sales were made in Bitcoin. When Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, it appealed to a core group of anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology types, who operated on the fringes of the financial system. Since then, it has gained popularity, attracting venture capitalists and investment firms.  But without government regulation, the mainstream has yet to fully embrace the virtual currency. The price of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly, from a few cents to more than $1,000 at its peak. Its current price is about $625, according to the website CoinDesk. On Thursday, New York became the first state to propose regulations for virtual currency companies operating in New York. And with more merchants accepting Bitcoin, it's only a matter of time before it is widely adopted as a viable form of payment. ""If you're a retailer, there's really no reason not to accept Bitcoin at this point,"" Mr. Luria said.                       "
Rand Paul Talks Tech,"A successful libertarian politician is a creature of nuance. After all, he is drawing a government salary to get rid of government, without confusing his audience. Speaking to a crowd of largely young, conservative techies in San Francisco on Saturday, the Republican and self-described libertarian Senator Rand Paul showed a lot of finesse in balancing opposites. It might also have been a preview of the kind of balancing he'll repeat nationally, as he ponders a 2016 presidential run.  Libertarians would win popular support, he said, ""if we convince people we're not opposed to government, we just need it minimized."" Dressed in faded jeans and a crisp white button-down shirt, Mr. Paul said Internet technology makes obsolete many government functions almost by existing. ""The crowd wants good service - you rate your Uber driver, your stay at a hotel,"" he said. ""As information becomes more widespread, maybe you need less and less government."" There were fewer specifics than ideas during his appearance, which consisted of a 30-minute talk followed by a panel. The event was ""2014: Reboot,"" a conference organized by Lincoln Labs, a group that tries to draw techies to conservative politics. The government, he said, should find and foster superstar teachers to wow students with online appearances. Yet in the classrooms ""there will still be teachers, reinforcing the lectures and handing out homework,"" he said. It was not clear how that would lead to less government, or how the government would find what he described as ""the LeBron James"" of pedagogy. Mr. Paul reiterated his admiration for Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency, but indicated it could be better utilized as a proxy for corporations. ""I'm not sure how or if it succeeds ultimately, but it's cool to think that Walmart, with a 3 or 4 percent margin, could double it"" by foregoing what it pays credit card companies, instead offering a kind of digital currency backed by corporate equity. A previous version of this idea rested on a basket of equities, but now Mr. Paul would let a hundred corporate coins be coded. ""Wal-coin, Kmart-coin, turn it in for Walmart stock, Kmart stock,"" Mr. Paul said. ""I think it's coming."" He did not say how, by attaching Bitcoin to regulated securities, the stateless digital currency would not be inside the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such quibbles mattered little to the audience, which was particularly receptive to Mr. Paul's criticism of the National Security Agency. He limited the criticism to how the N.S.A. goes about spying on people, not the spying itself. ""I'm all for sifting through information"" to catch terrorists, he said. Above all, the libertarian and the techies seemed to converge in one area: Silicon Valley's irrepressible self-belief augmented by the prospect of growing libertarian power. ""That's what I love about coming out here,"" Mr. Paul said. ""You create something out of nothing.""                       "
Proposed Rules Expose Rifts Among Bitcoin Enthusiasts,"A new front has opened in the battle over Bitcoin. Since New York became the first state to propose virtual currency regulations two weeks ago, Bitcoin enthusiasts have had a mixed reaction on whether the new rules will help legitimize the virtual currency or whether they will thwart innovation and threaten the very freedom that Bitcoin was meant to promote. The draft legislation has also exposed a division among virtual currency companies with enough resources to comply with the regulations and those without. On Tuesday, some Bitcoin supporters are planning to send an open letter to Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State's top financial regulator, requesting more time to comment on his proposed legislation.   ""Many of us are individuals or small start-ups operating on limited budgets without access to extensive legal resources,"" the letter states. ""This imposes a substantial burden as we seek to understand the proposed rules and their current and future impacts on our businesses, open-source projects and educational research."" The letter also refers to ""inconsistent statements"" and opaque language in the draft regulations. The letter, which has about 400 signatures, including many big names in the virtual currency industry, says the 45 days allotted for comments is not enough time for interested parties to provide adequate feedback on ""both the broad scope and detailed components of the proposed rules."" The letter requests 45 additional days. ""We really want to make this a collaborative and engaging process with regulators,"" said Austin Walne, who wrote the letter. ""We want to have a dialogue, and we want more time to have it."" A self-described technologist and Bitcoin enthusiast, Mr. Walne teamed up last week with Elizabeth Stark, an entrepreneur, to gauge reaction to the letter. The response, they said, was overwhelming. Hundreds of people, including executives from Bitcoin companies backed by venture capital, as well as students and users of Reddit, signed the letter. Among those who have added their signatures are Barry Silbert of SecondMarket, who runs a Bitcoin investment fund, and executives from the Bitcoin company BitPay. When it was introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, Bitcoin appealed to anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology buffs who operated on the fringes of the financial system. Now, as virtual currency becomes more accepted in the mainstream, start-ups could find themselves unable to comply with regulations that seem to favor more established financial companies. ""If only companies that have already raised tens of millions of dollars in funding can succeed, we can say goodbye to the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem,"" Ms. Stark wrote in an opinion article on TechCrunch last week. ""In effect, New York's proposed regulations will throw the baby out with the bathwater."" The regulations, introduced by Mr. Lawsky's office, the Department of Financial Services, are intended for virtual currency companies operating in New York and include rules on consumer protection, the prevention of money laundering and cybersecurity. A ""BitLicense"" would be required for Bitcoin exchanges and for companies that secure, store or maintain custody or control of the virtual currency on behalf of customers. Merchants that accept Bitcoin for payment, like Overstock.com, would not need to apply for a license.  Mr. Lawsky said the rules, the product of a nearly yearlong review, are intended to inspire consumer confidence and promote commerce by encouraging more companies to come to New York.  Still, virtual currency start-ups have taken issue with the extent of the regulations, some of which are stricter than existing rules for traditional financial institutions. Opponents of the rules have argued that start-ups simply don't have the resources to comply with certain licensing requirements, including onerous reporting rules, hefty capital requirements and robust cybersecurity programs.  ""I think most people were surprised that it is such a broad, sweeping regulation,"" said Jim Harper, global policy counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation. ""It seems meant to create an entirely new regulatory regime for Bitcoin."" The public currently has 45 days from July 23 to comment on the proposal, after which Mr. Lawsky's office intends to make changes to the rules and send them back out for review for another 30 days. So far, Mr. Lawsky said, his office has received ""thousands of comments"" on the proposed regulations. Though there has been vocal opposition to the rules, there is also a significant camp that considers the rules an important step to bringing Bitcoin and other computer-based currencies into the mainstream.  ""This is a very good thing for Bitcoin,"" Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said when the regulations were introduced. ""It may end up being one of the most important milestones in the development of Bitcoin."" Mr. Lawsky said on Tuesday that he was willing to address concerns that the regulations as they stand would squeeze smaller companies. He said he would also consider extending the comment period. ""This is certainly a unique situation where we're trying to regulate in an evolving, high-tech, innovative environment, and we want to make sure we get it right,"" Mr. Lawsky said. ""We will certainly think through very carefully the very obvious comment that, when it's a small start-up, they're going to have less resources in terms of compliance.""                       "
Wikipedia Begins Taking Donations in Bitcoin,"Bitcoin has found another taker. On Wednesday, the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit organization that operates Wikipedia, announced that it would allow people to make donations using Bitcoin, becoming the latest adopter of the virtual currency as a payment option.  ""It has always been important to the foundation to make sure donating is as simple and inclusive as possible,"" Lisa Gruwell, the chief revenue officer of Wikimedia, wrote in a blog post announcing the move. The foundation said that it had been asked to accept Bitcoin, and that those requests, as well as recent guidelines from the Internal Revenue Service, persuaded it to accept the virtual currency. Like many merchants that have adopted Bitcoin, Wikimedia has teamed up with Coinbase, a third-party payment processor that converts customers' Bitcoins into dollars. Coinbase, which began with $25 million from the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, is also working with Overstock, the online travel booking website Expedia and the satellite television provider Dish Network to accept the virtual currency. About two weeks ago, Dell announced that customers would be able to make purchases on its website using Bitcoin, claiming to be the biggest retailer yet to do so. In all, about 35,000 merchants use Coinbase's payment tools, according to the company's website. In a blog post announcing its partnership with Wikimedia, Coinbase said it would wave the processing fees for all registered nonprofit groups. Typically, companies working with Coinbase pay it a 1 percent processing fee after the first $1 million in sales. ""The Internet has made it easier for nonprofits to operate by enabling them to increase geographic reach and reduce the overhead required to fund-raise,"" the company said. ""Adding Bitcoin as a donation option is a natural next step for nonprofits."" Since it was first introduced by a programmer, or group of programmers, in 2009, Bitcoin has gained popularity, particularly among investment firms and venture capitalists. Two weeks ago, New York became the first state to propose regulations for virtual currency companies.  And while an increasing number of well-known companies are also beginning to embrace Bitcoin, in part to lower processing fees, it is not clear how many customers are using the currency to pay for goods and services. ""The volume of Bitcoin purchases on these websites is still a relatively small proportion to the overall volume on these sites,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. ""But the rate at which they are growing and the rate of spending out of a relatively small consumer base is becoming meaningful."" "
"For Merchants, Bitcoin Shows More Pop Than Potential","Jason Hand had more money in his Bitcoin wallet than in his savings account. So when he wanted a white linen suit for a vacation trip to Panama, he turned to Overstock.com, a discount retailer that accepted the virtual currency. The suit he selected cost about $100 - or a little more than a tenth of a Bitcoin. ""Bitcoin is essentially just online cash,"" he said. ""You should be able to pay for things however you want to pay for them.""  Merchants that accept Bitcoin are trying to attract virtual currency enthusiasts like Mr. Hand, 37, of Boulder, Colo. And the number of merchants has been growing. Since January, major retailers like Overstock, the online travel booking website Expedia, the computer maker Dell and the satellite television provider Dish Network have started allowing customers to pay using the virtual currency on their websites. Bitcoin supporters view the more widespread adoption of Bitcoin by popular companies as an important step toward pushing the currency into the mainstream. Yet even as more retailers are beginning to embrace digital money, the number of consumers using Bitcoin to make purchases has remained small. There are benefits for merchants in offering Bitcoin as a payment option - lower processing fees rank high on the list - but some have questioned whether accepting virtual currency amounts to anything more than a marketing gimmick. ""From the store's viewpoint, I think it's great publicity,"" said Steven Englander, a research analyst with Citigroup. ""It makes you edgy."" Despite the increase in merchants that accept Bitcoin, the number of daily Bitcoin transactions has hovered around 60,000 since the beginning of the year, according to the website Blockchain.info. Overstock, which began taking Bitcoin as a form of payment in January, said that only about a quarter of a percent of its sales were in the virtual currency, or about $12,000 to $15,000 a day. With about $1.3 billion in total sales in 2013, Overstock was the first big-name merchant to adopt Bitcoin. Expedia, which had about $4.8 billion in revenue last year, also said that less than 1 percent of its sales had been in Bitcoin since it began accepting the currency in June. Dell, which started allowing Bitcoin payments on its website in July, declined to disclose specific figures about its Bitcoin sales but noted that its biggest transaction to date was for a server costing about $50,000, or 85 coins. One reason Bitcoin transactions have not yet taken off, experts say, is that the virtual currency does not provide obvious benefits for customers. In many ways, it is still easier to pay with a credit card or a PayPal account than with Bitcoin, especially at retailers like coffee shops or grocery stores. Transacting in Bitcoin is also riskier because consumers are not protected against virtual currency fraud, making it a less appealing option for those mindful of the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin trading platform that was based in Japan. ""My sense is that a few consumers try to use it as much as they can, but most consumers don't find it nearly as convenient as using a credit card,"" Mr. Englander said about the currency. ""You transact in Bitcoin because you love it, not because it gives you any major advantages."" Another potential disadvantage is that the price of a Bitcoin can be volatile. In about five years, the value of the virtual currency has gone from just a few dollars to more than $1,000. It is now trading around $500, according to the virtual currency website CoinDesk. When Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous programmer, or group of programmers, it appealed to anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology buffs, who operated outside the traditional financial system. More recently, it has become more popular, particularly among investment firms and entrepreneurs. Without government regulation, however, many are reluctant to use the virtual currency. For merchants, however, there is significant upside. It costs companies little to accept Bitcoin beyond first establishing a new payment channel. Processing fees for Bitcoin transactions are often much lower for retailers. When customers use a credit card or debit card, these fees can be around 5 percent. By contrast, Coinbase, a third-party payment processor that has teamed up with many of these big retailers to accept Bitcoin, charges a 1 percent processing fee after the first $1 million in sales. The chief executive of Overstock, Patrick Byrne, estimated that it cost about $100,000 to integrate Bitcoin into the site's payment system, pennies compared with the millions of dollars it spends on advertising, for example. Michael Gulmann, the vice president of global product at Expedia, said: ""We have costs associated with running our business. The lower we can get those costs, the better."" It is difficult to put an exact figure on the number of merchants that accept Bitcoin, but experts say the total globally is as many as 80,000. Big-name retailers like Expedia and Overstock get more attention, but most of these companies are mom-and-pop stores. Some say the interest among smaller businesses points to a mounting frustration with processing fees and chargebacks, which can hurt the bottom lines of local shops. ""These are the businesses that are hit hardest by credit card fees,"" said Adam White, the director of business development and strategy at Coinbase. ""For them, Bitcoin isn't a 'nice to have,' it's the only option for them to survive."" Accepting Bitcoin may also be a marketing tactic. When retailers started accepting Bitcoin, a big appeal was the virtual currency's ability to attract new customers with its novelty. Being among the first to embrace Bitcoin was an easy, relatively cheap way for companies to capitalize on interest in digital money, said Derek D. Rucker, a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ""They're not just manufacturing curiosity and interest, they're borrowing interest,"" he said about these retailers. ""It's possible they're using their association with Bitcoin for different reasons, but clearly, it's an attention-grabber."" Merchants like Overstock and Dell said they experienced an initial bump in activity on their sites after announcing they would accept Bitcoin, especially after they received media attention. Now, however, some see signs that there may be a bit of Bitcoin fatigue. Sales at Overstock, for example, have fallen considerably since its first week of Bitcoin transactions, when it had about $500,000 worth, said Mr. Byrne, Overstock's chief executive. ""There's a corner of the market that wanted to use Bitcoin, and this was a chance to get that piece of the market before anyone else got to it,"" Mr. Byrne said. ""People who accept it now aren't going to get nearly the publicity that we did."" "
Overstock to Allow International Customers to Pay in Bitcoin,"One big retailer is about the conquer the next Bitcoin frontier. Since the beginning of the year, a number of well-known retailers, including Overstock, Expedia and Dell, have started accepting Bitcoin for domestic sales through their websites. Now, Overstock is preparing to allow international customers to pay in Bitcoin as well, becoming the biggest merchant to extend the payment option beyond the United States market. On Sept. 1, Overtock plans to introduce a new payments system on its international website, O.co, that will allow customers to make purchases using the virtual currency, said Patrick Byrne, the company's chief executive. The company started taking Bitcoin payments in January from domestic customers.  ""I know that's it's become part of the Bitcoin lore in the United States to shop on Overstock,"" said Mr. Byrne, who has made no secret of his support for the virtual currency. ""My hope is that would happen at a global level.""  Many small, more obscure merchants already accept Bitcoin for cross-border transactions. But the move by popular retailers like Overstock into the international space could foretell a more widespread adoption of the virtual currency as a viable payment option.  Dell, for example, which began allowing United States customers and small business to pay with Bitcoin in July, said it wanted to gauge the initial interest in the currency before planning its next steps, which could include rolling out the payment option internationally. ""We wanted to expose this to our customers and see what the uptake was,"" said Paul Walsh, the chief information officer of Dell Commerce Services.  A desire to test the United States market before committing to wider acceptance of the currency may be the reason more merchants have not yet extended the payment option to international customers, said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. ""If you're a big retailer, and you're trying to embrace a new technology, you're going to want to be able to do it gradually,"" he said, adding that the benefits for merchants once they do start accepting Bitcoin internationally are significant.  Accepting Bitcoin could make international payments easier for companies because it eliminates the need for currency translation. That, coupled with lower payment processing fees associated with digital money, could result in savings for retailers and consumers of up to 8 percent, Mr. Luria said. Though Bitcoin's value has been slumping recently, merchants like Overstock are not affected  because they accept the currency through a third-party payment processor, which converts the sales to dollars.  Yet even as more merchants are embracing Bitcoin, consumers may still be wary of transacting with the virtual currency. The total number of daily Bitcoin transactions has lingered around 60,000 since the beginning of the year, and consumers paying with currency make up a meager percentage of total sales for companies like Expedia and Overstock. For example, Mr. Byrne said that only about a quarter of 1 percent of Overstock's sales were in Bitcoin - that's about $12,000 to $15,000 a day in transactions. He expects the company, which had $1.3 billion in total sales in 2013, to record $6 million to $8 million in domestic Bitcoin sales this year and was optimistic that it could pull in an additional $2 million internationally. Because Overstock anticipates saving money on processing fees by accepting Bitcoin, Mr. Byrne also said the company intended to give 4 percent of its Bitcoin sales to various foundations that support the adoption of the currency. Eventually, Mr. Byrne said, he intends to pass on some of Overstock's savings to the consumer as well. ""Bitcoin saves us so much money that we want to help the community,"" he said.                       "
"Chain, a Bitcoin Start-Up, Raises $9.5 Million Led by Khosla Ventures","Another virtual currency start-up has attracted real dollars from prominent investors. Chain, which aims to make it easier for developers to build Bitcoin applications, announced on Wednesday that it had closed a $9.5 million investment round led by Khosla Ventures, bringing its total funding to $13.7 million. RRE Ventures, Thrive Capital, SV Angel, Pantera Capital and the Bitcoin investor Barry Silbert were also among the backers.  Keith Rabois, an investment partner at Khosla and a former chief operating officer of Square, has joined the company's board. ""Bitcoin is this tremendous financial innovation that's changing the world, and we're really excited to play a central role in that,"" said Adam Ludwin, who co-founded Chain. ""The promise that Bitcoin offers to basically hit the reset button on the financial system is real."" It is this potential that continues to lure venture capital companies to the virtual currency. The Bitcoin company BitPay scooped up $30 million in May. And in December, Coinbase, a third-party payment processor, raised $25 million led by the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz.  Like other digital money supporters, these investors generally believe that Bitcoin could eventually be used to transfer money around the world without using traditional payment channels. ""I think they now recognize the huge commercial potential of the technology,"" Mr. Ludwin said, referring to venture investors. ""Every single top-tier firm is taking Bitcoin incredibly seriously."" When it was introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, Bitcoin appealed largely to anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology buffs, but it has since become increasingly popular in the mainstream. A number of well-known merchants, including Overstock, Expedia and Dell, now accept the virtual currency. Bitcoin has also caught the eye of regulators, including New York's Department of Financial Services, which recently proposed legislation for virtual currency companies. Chain, which was formed six months ago, provides quick access to Bitcoin's online ledger of transactions, called the blockchain, allowing developers to integrate the currency's technology more easily into their products.   Since the company went live in May, it has signed up over a thousand developers building products like Bitcoin wallets and exchanges. It has also been in talks with several big financial institutions that want to connect Bitcoin to their traditional offerings. Mr. Ludwin said that over the long term, Chain is more interested in harnessing the blockchain technology itself, which could eventually enable other decentralized systems beyond Bitcoin. (The company chose not to include a reference to Bitcoin in its name for that reason.) The company plans to use its latest money to expand its engineering team. ""This sort of lays the foundation,"" Mr. Ludwin said. ""Now, we want to go build a house.""                       "
On To-Do List: Deposit Cash in Bitcoin A.T.M.,"Welcome to the A.T.M. of the future, where customers insert cash and leave with nothing. A cashless society is still a long way off, but automated machines that turn traditional money into virtual currency are cropping up across the globe. The trend has come to New York - Flat 128, a retailer that sells British jewelry and accessories in the West Village, is home to the first such machine in Manhattan and is becoming a destination for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Yet this new Bitcoin A.T.M. is only a means for users to deposit cash and convert it to Bitcoins for their accounts; it does not offer cash withdrawals.  Still, virtual currency supporters see the growth of these machines as a milestone that will help Bitcoin A.T.M.s become as widespread as traditional bank A.T.M.s. For that to happen, however, customers will have to get used to exchanging real money for digital code, which may be a bit unsettling for those accustomed to cash, or even credit cards. As Bitcoin gains acceptance, such A.T.M.s are providing a fast path to change cash to Bitcoin. They also are a way to access Bitcoin for those who do not want to deal with online exchanges or who lack a traditional bank account. ""The goal of Bitcoin is to make money digital,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. ""This is really a temporary way of bridging between physical currency and digital currency."" The A.T.M.s appeal in particular to those who want to maintain the anonymity associated with Bitcoin, he said. The companies that make the Bitcoin A.T.M.s say they aim to make virtual currency as easy to obtain as buying food from a vending machine or ordering a car ride from Uber on a smartphone. Even so, some in the virtual currency industry acknowledge that the machines are a marketing gimmick. ""Having these machines in stores, especially quality stores that sell quality items, is really going to raise the profile of Bitcoin,"" said Matt Russell, the chief marketing officer for PYC, a company that operates Bitcoin A.T.M.s in New York. ""We'd be fools to not think that marketing is a part of this."" If the A.T.M.s are to help push Bitcoin further into the mainstream, then more consumers may be seeing machines, like the one that went live at Flat 128 last week, which is operated by PYC. The machine may be a draw for Bitcoin enthusiasts, many of whom probably never would have set foot in the store otherwise. ""I heard about it from friends,"" Adam Krellenstein, a developer at a Bitcoin company, said on Friday, standing awkwardly among the chunky necklaces and expensive rings. Flat 128's regular clientele seemed confused by the new attention. Some peered cautiously at the machine, asking what it did and how it worked. One, after noticing a photographer nearby, asked if she had walked into some sort of special event. Elizabeth DuBois, the owner of Flat 128, said the A.T.M. had increased traffic, estimating that 15 to 20 people had visited her boutique each day to use the A.T.M. Merchants around the country say that the Bitcoin A.T.M.s are helping draw would-be customers, too. Some of those are in coffee shops, where the tech crowd and early Bitcoin adopters are coming in for beverages. Small shops like Flat 128 certainly benefit from the publicity that comes with accepting Bitcoin, but there are also significant financial advantages, including lower processing fees. There are about 200 working Bitcoin A.T.M.s around the world, according to the website Coin ATM Radar, which keeps track of the machines in operation. As that number grows, one company expecting a surge in business is Lamassu, which manufactured the machine in Manhattan. The company, based in New Hampshire, started selling Bitcoin A.T.M.s last August and has since shipped 250 machines to 45 countries, although many are not yet set up to convert local currency into Bitcoins, said Zach Harvey, who runs Lamassu with his brother. About 80 of the machines, which cost about $6,500 each, are in operation worldwide, he said. The machine's operator is responsible for loading the machine with Bitcoins, similar to the way a bank ensures that its A.T.M.s have enough to cover cash withdrawals. The operator also determines the transaction fee. For example, PYC has set the fee at its Manhattan A.T.M. at about 5 percent of the transaction value. At Flat 128, the only things users need to exchange cash for Bitcoins with a Lamassu machine are an existing Bitcoin wallet and a smartphone. After hitting a start button on the machine's touch screen, users access their Bitcoin wallet's QR code, a type of bar code, from their phone. They then scan the code against a small screen on the machine and insert cash. To initiate the currency exchange, they select ""Send Bitcoins."" It takes only a few seconds for Bitcoins to appear, via the Internet, in the user's digital wallet. Other manufacturers of Bitcoin A.T.M.s, including Genesis Coin and the Canadian company BitAccess, aim to also allow users to turn Bitcoins into cash. Even as the rise of these A.T.M.s suggests that Bitcoin is gaining ground, the virtual currency world is also facing the prospect of new rules that could stunt growth. Government agencies continue to make efforts to regulate digital money, stirring concern that virtual currency could eventually be regulated into oblivion. In July, for example, New York State proposed rules for virtual currency companies that some in the Bitcoin world believe could make it too expensive to operate in the state. Bitcoin A.T.M.s are particularly vulnerable to regulations intended to prevent money laundering. ""I'm always concerned about harsher regulation,"" said Mr. Harvey of Lamassu. ""If the barrier for entry is too high, then these machines might have to move out of New York City."" Despite these looming rules, Bitcoin supporters are largely optimistic that it is not only a viable form of currency, but also increasingly accessible. Mr. Russell of PYC was on hand Friday to answer questions about Manhattan's first A.T.M. About three months ago, he purchased the A.T.M. for $5,000 in Bitcoin and kept it in his East Village apartment. He and Ms. DuBois, Flat 128's owner, decided to bring the machine to her store in part to introduce the idea of Bitcoin to consumers who might not be familiar with the virtual currency. ""It makes them understand that it's not a foreign thing,"" Mr. Russell said. ""It's just like getting cash from a bank, but Bitcoin.""                       "
Election Panel Enacts Policies by Not Acting,"WASHINGTON -- The three Republican and three Democratic appointees of the Federal Election Commission had reached yet another deadlock: They would issue no advisory opinion on whether the Conservative Action Fund could accept contributions of Bitcoin, the online currency created to be untraceable. But a ruling of sorts emerged nonetheless in the hearing, held late last year, when one of the Republican commissioners, Lee E. Goodman, suggested that the group could essentially do as it pleased. The fund ''has a clear statutory right to give and receive in-kind contributions regardless of what we say here today,'' Mr. Goodman said. The case was just one of the more than 200 times in the past six years that the commission has split votes, reflecting a deep ideological divide over how aggressively to regulate money in politics that mirrors the partisan gridlock in Congress. But instead of paralyzing the commission, the 3-to-3 votes have created a rapidly expanding universe of unofficial law, where Republican commissioners have loosened restrictions on candidates and outside groups simply by signaling what standards they are willing to enforce.  Campaign lawyers of both parties say the deadlocks have profoundly, if informally, affected the rules governing campaigns, particularly on questions involving whether political nonprofit groups must disclose their finances and the threshold for starting an investigation. The splits are consistent enough in spelling out the likely direction of enforcement, they say, that they now advise clients that a 3-to-3 split comes close to official commission policy. ''If you've got a client who is not as risk-averse, then you can sit down with them and say, 'Here's the situation, you have three commissioners who say this is lawful, and that is something you can rely on between now and November for your campaign strategy,' '' said Michael E. Toner, a Republican election lawyer and former commissioner. Some election lawyers have even turned the deadlocks into a kind of marketing spiel. As Anthony Herman, a lawyer at Covington & Burling, put it in an article on the firm's website: ''The F.E.C.: Where a 'Tie' Can Be (Almost) a 'Win.' '' In an interview, Mr. Goodman, the commission chairman, described the guiding principle as one of deference to First Amendment political speech. In case of a deadlock, he said, the ''tie goes to the speaker.'' That philosophy has not only changed the way older regulations are applied, but has also helped create de facto rules on emerging issues: whether candidates can set up fake websites for opponents to raise money for themselves, for example, and what disclosures are required on text-message political ads. Perhaps the biggest impact is on the rapidly growing world of outside spending. F.E.C. deadlocks have transformed the regulatory system intended to ensure that outside groups operate independently of the candidates they support -- the distinction that, under the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, permits them to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. Twice the commission has reached an impasse on rules affecting whether a ''super PAC'' can borrow video prepared by a candidate for his or her own ads. Candidates of both parties now routinely make available so-called B-roll video, ensuring that super PAC ads look and feel similar to the candidate's own ads. In a January hearing on text-message advertising, Caroline C. Hunter, one of the Republican commissioners, told the lawyer for a left-leaning digital media firm that his client need not worry if the commission declined to bless its proposed approach to disclosure. ''It looks like this is going to go down 3 to 3,'' Ms. Hunter said. ''And so there's not four votes to say, 'You can't do this.' '' Under federal law, no more than three members of the commission may belong to the same political party. Four votes are required to issue an advisory opinion, pursue an investigation or agree on a punishment. Veterans of the commission say that for many years the arrangement was effective in encouraging commissioners to apply rules consistently to both parties. But deadlocks have become far more common since 2008, when three new Republican commissioners joined the commission. According to a study by Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the liberal-leaning group Public Citizen, the commission has not only taken up far fewer advisory requests and issued fewer regulations than it did before 2008, it has also split votes on a greater proportion of the matters it does consider. In the five years leading up to 2008, the commission held 3,634 votes on enforcement actions and split votes on 39. In the five subsequent years, it held just 866 enforcement votes, and split votes on 123 of them. ''The Republicans on the commission realized they can render the commission toothless,'' said Mr. Holman, whose organization favors tougher disclosure rules and is suing the commission for what it says is a failure to enforce existing disclosure rules against Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, a leading Republican outside group. Mr. Goodman acknowledged that candidates and outside groups were operating in a less restrictive regulatory environment than five years ago. But he argued that the shift reflected deregulatory court rulings, such as Citizens United, and a proper restraint in applying limits on political speech. ''Certainly the Republicans have become far more circumspect in where we draw the lines,'' Mr. Goodman said. Mr. Goodman also said that the percentage of deadlocks had dropped over the past year and represented only a small percentage of total votes by the commission. ''Our opinion is as legitimate as their opinion,'' he said, referring to the three commissioners appointed by Democrats. ''If there aren't four votes to support a regulatory position, it's not the position of the F.E.C.'' The deadlocks appear to have had a particular impact on enforcement cases. In a series of deadlocks over proposed fines or settlements, Republican commissioners have in effect created a new, higher standard for investigations, arguing that direct evidence of a violation must already exist before the commission staff can even begin investigating a complaint. ''It is not enough for the commission to believe that there is a reason to investigate whether a violation occurred,'' the three Republican commissioners wrote in an opinion last year blocking an investigation into officials of the Arizona Democratic Party. A commission deadlock on a complaint can be challenged in court, but under court rulings dating to the early 1990s, federal judges in such cases have deferred to the legal interpretation of the three commissioners voting to block an investigation. ''The fact that there is this deference given to what is an obstacle to disclosure ultimately means that there is no meaningful judicial remedy when the F.E.C. does not come to a decision,'' said Ann M. Ravel, a Democrat who joined the commission last year. Even apparent agreements among the commissioners can be illusory. In May, in a separate request involving Bitcoin, the commissioners unanimously agreed that a fledgling group called Make Your Laws could accept small Bitcoin contributions of no more than $100. But in a separate statement, Mr. Goodman suggested that potential Bitcoins donors should not worry about the new policy. The advisory opinion, he wrote, ''in no way establishes the outer boundary for the contribution and use of Bitcoins.'' "
Top Bitcoin Proponent to Plead Guilty to Federal Charge,"A prominent supporter of Bitcoin, Charles Shrem, says he will plead guilty on Thursday to resolve federal charges that he helped smooth the way for drug transactions on the online marketplace Silk Road. He is to plead in New York to one count of aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business. Mr. Shrem, one of the most vocal advocates of Bitcoin, was accused in January of using his company to convert dollars into Bitcoin for users of Silk Road, the now-defunct bazaar known for its wide selection of narcotics and drug paraphernalia. Federal prosecutors contended that he operated the scheme in cooperation with Robert Faiella, known as BTCKing, who was also arrested in January, in Florida.  ''They want a guilty plea on their books, and that's what they're going to get,'' Mr. Shrem said on Saturday from his parents' home in Brooklyn. ''They got a Bitcoiner.'' Mr. Shrem's arrest at Kennedy International Airport this year stirred consternation in the Bitcoin world, which continues to grapple with the perception that the digital currency provides an anonymous way to engage in illegal activity. Mr. Shrem and Mr. Faiella were both charged with conspiring to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Mr. Shrem was also charged with ''willfully failing to file any suspicious activity report'' regarding Mr. Faiella's actions. At the time of Mr. Shrem's arrest, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement that the authorities would ''aggressively pursue those who would co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.'' The United States attorney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. When it was introduced in 2009, Bitcoin appealed largely to anti-establishment enthusiasts who wanted to circumvent the traditional financial system. As it has gained popularity, government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, have wrestled with how to regulate the virtual currency. In July, New York's Department of Financial Services proposed the first state rules for virtual currency companies. A so-called BitLicense would be required for Bitcoin exchanges and for companies that secured, stored or maintained custody or control of virtual currency on behalf of customers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued its first consumer advisory on virtual currencies this month. But even as regulators seek to impose rules for virtual currency, the Bitcoin industry remains a powerful force, particularly in online black markets. A second version of Silk Road has formed, which sells many of the same drugs that the first marketplace offered. Since his arrest, Mr. Shrem -- a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation's board and a co-founder and former chief executive of the company BitInstant -- has remained involved with Bitcoin. In addition to speaking engagements, he said he had been working for Payza, an online platform for sending and receiving the coins, and had set up an office at a co-working space in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Mr. Shrem had been under house arrest at his parents', but he has been allowed to leave the home from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on most weekdays. Mr. Shrem, 24, said his plea could include jail time, though he is optimistic that it will not. Before his sentencing in about three months, he said, he plans to ask Bitcoin supporters to write letters to the judge on his behalf. Mr. Shrem's plans to plead were first reported by Reuters. Once his current legal troubles are behind him, he said, he intended to travel to various places around the United States and possibly to Europe. Mr. Shrem said he would continue to press for Bitcoin and intended to be involved in regulatory efforts. ''I want to do the good work I was doing before I got arrested,'' he said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
The Elections Cop Invites Mischief,"The country's increasingly lawless political system needs a traffic cop to set clear rules and rein in violators who think nothing of breaking the spending limits. That's supposed to be the job of the Federal Election Commission, but the agency has made a travesty of its mission, encouraging bad behavior rather than stopping it. There are six members of the commission, three from each party, with four votes required to take any significant action. In 1975, the agency's architects in Congress might have had reason to believe that equal division would encourage nonpartisan thinking. But in the current age of outright hostility between right and left, the commission is unable to get four votes for any issue of importance.  As Nicholas Confessore reported last week in The Times, those deadlocks mean more than simple paralysis; Republican commissioners are telling violators that a tie vote actually gives them permission to push past the old limits on spending and disclosure. According to Michael Toner, a Republican election lawyer and former commissioner, it's perfectly proper to advise a client, ''you have three commissioners who say this is lawful, and that is something you can rely on between now and November for your campaign strategy.'' The Republican chairman of the commission, Lee Goodman, said the panel was simply deferring to First Amendment political speech. The ''tie goes to the speaker,'' he said, which sounds like a defense of civil liberties until you remember that Republicans (with the backing of the Supreme Court) now consider money to be speech, so that ties actually go to the rich. A few recent examples: In July, the commission refused to even investigate whether two ''dark money'' spending groups -- the kind that don't disclose their donors -- had falsely claimed they were not really political committees that are required to disclose. The groups, Americans for Job Security and the American Action Network, had together spent more than $26 million on election-related ads in 2010, but the agency couldn't be bothered to look into an obvious potential violation. ''At a minimum, the commission should have investigated these organizations in order to vindicate the public's interest in knowing the source of political spending,'' wrote the three Democratic commissioners. In January, the commission refused to impose a serious penalty on Winning Our Future, Newt Gingrich's ''super PAC,'' which ignored federal deadlines for reporting expenditures and advertisements until after the 2012 presidential election, at which point it disbanded. Two Democratic commissioners said the message was clear: super PACs ''can evade the rules with impunity.'' Late last year, the commission deadlocked on whether the Conservative Action Fund could accept contributions in Bitcoin, the virtual online currency. The untraceable nature of Bitcoin could lead to illegal foreign contributions or other improper donations. Mr. Goodman told the fund that the deadlock meant it could accept all the Bitcoin donations it wanted. The percentage of F.E.C. deadlocks is much higher now than before 2008, when three Republicans joined the panel determined to loosen federal regulations on campaigns. It's increasingly clear that commission's current structure doesn't work; the president should be allowed to appoint a permanent chair as a seventh member, to break ties. If the agency still refuses to enforce the law, at least voters will know who is responsible. "
"Charles Shrem, Bitcoin Supporter, Pleads Guilty to Federal Charge","Charles Shrem, an outspoken proponent of Bitcoin who has come to symbolize the government's crackdown on the virtual currency, pleaded guilty on Thursday to one count of aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.  Mr. Shrem was arrested in January and was accused of using his company to convert dollars into Bitcoin for users of Silk Road, the now-defunct online marketplace known for selling narcotics and drug paraphernalia. Federal prosecutors contend that he operated the scheme in cooperation with Robert Faiella, known as BTCKing. Mr. Faiella also pleaded guilty on Thursday to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The pleas were part of a deal with prosecutors from the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. Reading from a statement, Mr. Shrem said he had knowingly helped Mr. Faiella from January 2012 to October 2012 by exchanging dollars into Bitcoin using his company, BitInstant. He said Mr. Faiella would in turn sell Bitcoin to people who wanted to buy drugs on Silk Road. ""I knew that what I was doing was wrong,"" Mr. Shrem, 24, said in the statement. ""I am pleading guilty because I am guilty."" Mr. Shrem and Mr. Faiella both face up to five years in prison. Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court set Jan. 20 as the sentencing date for both men. Before Thursday's hearing in New York federal court in downtown Manhattan, Mr. Shrem, wearing jeans and a dark suit jacket, sat alone on a bench outside courtroom 14B, his right leg crossed over his left as he read a book. He appeared calm, fidgeting only slightly once he entered the courtroom. Known for his charisma, he was instead stoic, his voice unwavering, when he entered his plea. A founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation's board and a co-founder and former chief executive of the company BitInstant, Mr. Shrem has been one of the most vocal advocates of Bitcoin, and his arrest in January at Kennedy International Airport put the Bitcoin world on edge. Since then, some in the Bitcoin world have distanced themselves from Mr. Shrem.  And while his charisma has given him a powerful voice among Bitcoin enthusiasts, a few have voiced concern that he has a tendency to say too much. Though he had been under house arrest at his parents' house in Brooklyn, he has continued to speak publicly in support of Bitcoin. He has also been working for Payza, an online platform for sending and receiving the coins. Mr. Shrem's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said after the court appearance that Mr. Shrem had every intention of staying involved with Bitcoin. ""Charlie Shrem is on a path to making Bitcoin a more accepted and useful currency,"" he said. ""If God smiles on him, hopefully he will be back in the Bitcoin world.""                       "
Google's F.T.C. Tab for Charges Rung Up by Children: $19 Million,"Here are some reasons why people might not want children to play with their phone: They don't want them to accidentally call their boss. They don't want them to become mindless phone addicts like they are. Also, they don't want get stuck with a $200 bill for digital coins, virtual lives and other video game perks that cost real-world money.   On Thursday, Google became the latest mobile company to settle a Federal Trade Commission complaint that asserts it rang up millions in unfair charges made by children using mobile apps on Android devices.  In a news release, the F.T.C. said Google has agreed to give full refunds to the many hapless people who had children ring up app charges without their permission. Google's minimum payment will be $19 million. The Internet giant also agreed to tweak its password policies so that children can't make purchases that the phone's owner hasn't agreed to. ""As more Americans embrace mobile technology, it's vital to remind companies that time-tested consumer protections still apply, including that consumers should not be charged for purchases they did not authorize,"" said the  F.T.C. chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, in the news release.  Mobile apps and video games are often free to download, but that doesn't mean they're free (or even cheap). Charges for apps downloaded from Google's Play Store can range from a dollar to $200, and, in the case of video games, they usually get better the more people spend.  ""In many apps used by children, users are invited to accumulate virtual items that help them advance in the game, though as the F.T.C.'s complaint notes, the lines between virtual money purchases and real money purchases can be blurred,"" the F.T.C. said.  The problem is that once a user has put their credit card information in, Google - which handles the transactions for in-app purchases, and takes a 30-percent cut  - didn't ask its mobile customers to re-authorize additional transactions. ""Children could incur in-app charges simply by clicking on popup boxes within the app as they used it,"" the F.T.C. said. Google added a new pop-up box in 2012, but, since there was often a 30 minute password-free period after authorization, the boxes were viewed as not that effective. ""Google employees referred to the issue as 'friendly fraud' and 'family fraud' in describing kids' unauthorized in-app charges as a leading source of refund requests,"" the F.T.C. said, adding that Google handled complaints by referring them to app developers (who don't actually process the transactions).  Google, of course, is only the latest tech company to settle an F.T.C. complaint about app charges made by children. In January, Apple made a similar settlement for a minimum of $32.5 million. The F.T.C. filed a complaint against Amazon in July, but Amazon is fighting it.  "
"Braintree, Popular Payments Processor, to Accept Bitcoin","Soon, you may be able to pay for your next Uber ride with Bitcoin.  Braintree, the payments processing company owned by eBay, said Monday that its customers would soon be able to accept Bitcoin, the digital currency popular in some tech and finance circles.   The company, which eBay bought for $800 million in cash one year ago, is considered a more developer-friendly division of PayPal, eBay's online payments behemoth. Many of Braintree's clients are tech start-ups like Uber, Airbnb and TaskRabbit, businesses that are looking for easy ways to integrate payments into their products for a low cost.  ""It feels like we're at the right moment in time now that a lot of those early problems with Bitcoin have been solved,"" Bill Ready, chief executive of Braintree, said on stage Monday at the TechCrunch Disrupt technology conference in San Francisco.  Many companies have been slow to adopt the fledgling digital currency, which has stunted potential growth; because so few companies accept it, consumers are less likely to adopt and regularly use Bitcoin.   Bitcoin has some upside for merchants willing to accept it, including lower transaction fees than credit cards. Because of this, some major consumer Internet companies are starting to toe the waters. Overstock.com, an online retailer, began accepting Bitcoin payments this year. Expedia, the online travel booking site, also accepts the alternative currency, as does the computing giant Dell Inc. Mr. Ready did not specify which Braintree clients would eventually accept Bitcoin, but said that customers should expect to hear more in the coming months.                        "
Coinbase Extends Bitcoin Access to International Customers,"Coinbase is taking its Bitcoin services to Europe in a move that could help expand the virtual currency's reach. The company, one of the most popular digital wallet providers, said on Wednesday that it was expanding to 13 European countries, including France, Italy and the Netherlands, by allowing those with authorized European bank accounts to buy and sell Bitcoins in exchange for euros. Previously, only users with United States bank accounts could exchange Bitcoins on Coinbase, though anyone in the world could set up a digital wallet to hold the virtual currency. ""The ability to easily buy and sell Bitcoin has been a really key factor in accelerating Bitcoin adoption,"" said Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase. ""This opens up the entire network to a larger degree.""  In the beginning, Coinbase, based in San Francisco, will limit Bitcoin purchases and sales to 500 euros, or about $645, a day to ensure the process is smooth, but Mr. Ehrsam said he expected that limit to increase quickly. Coinbase allows United States users to buy and sell up to $50,000 a day in Bitcoin. Coinbase's move comes as Bitcoin is at a pivotal point in its development. Bitcoin has undeniably become more popular since it was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous founder known as Satoshi Nakamoto, with a number of well-known merchants, including Overstock and Dell, now accepting the virtual currency. Just this week, Braintree, the payments processing company owned by eBay, said that its customers would soon be able to accept Bitcoin. Regulators around the world have taken note of Bitcoin as well, stirring anxiety in some circles that government oversight will squash the freedom and anonymity that attracts many virtual currency users. But even as Bitcoin enters the mainstream lexicon, supporters say Bitcoin's potential - which lies in its underlying technology - has yet to be fully exploited. For the virtual currency to become truly useful, they say, Bitcoin must harness this peer-to-peer technology to make it easier to complete tasks that were previously difficult, expensive or impossible. These include cross-border transfers like remittances, which, under the current financial system, can be subject to high fees and long delays. By taking out the middleman, Bitcoin could offer a simpler, cheaper way for people to send money across the globe. One of the first steps, however, is getting Bitcoin into the hands of more people, and companies like Coinbase - along with other exchanges that accept multiple currencies - are playing a big role in expanding the virtual currency's network. Coinbase, which has raised $31 million from prominent investors, expects to grow even more rapidly with the new expansion. The company has 1.6 million customer accounts, largely in the United States, up from 20,000 at the beginning of 2013, Mr. Ehrsam said. He added that he was optimistic that European activity would equal that in the United States in about a year. Eventually, Coinbase is planning to extend its offerings to countries beyond Europe. As Bitcoin becomes more accessible, Mr. Ehrsam said he hoped more merchants across the globe would begin to accept the virtual currency as a payment option. Coinbase, which has teamed up with many of the big-name merchants in the United States to process Bitcoin payments, is also working on creating online payment pages for merchants in their local languages. ""Bitcoin is inherently international, and one of its great promises is it enable cross-border payments in a more efficient way,"" Mr. Ehrsam said. ""It now allows these cross-border payments to flow, and the entire network benefits from the fact that we happen to be the ones to launch it.""                       "
The Digital Wallet Revolution,"Edward Castronova is a professor of media at Indiana University and author of ''Wildcat Currency: How the Virtual Money Revolution Is Transforming the Economy.'' Joshua A.T. Fairfield is a professor of law at Washington and Lee University. THIS week Apple announced two new pieces of hardware, the iPhone 6 and a ''smartwatch.'' But as flashy as they are, neither item is as groundbreaking as a piece of software that will accompany them: a digital wallet, allowing users to eschew cash and credit cards for a quick swipe of their device at the register. Apple's digital wallet, if widely adopted, could usher in a new era of ease and convenience. But the really exciting part is the fast-emerging future that it points toward, in which virtual assets of all sorts -- traditional currencies, but also Bitcoin, airline miles, cellphone minutes -- are interchangeable, opening up enormous purchasing power for consumers and creating tough challenges for governments around the world.  Moving toward a digital wallet for dollars (or yen, or euros) is only a marginal step forward; throughout history, money's value has been largely virtual anyway -- think of stocks, or personal lines of credit. The real change is how the digital wallet technology facilitates the parallel emergence of virtual purchasing power, like loyalty points. We don't typically think of these as currency, because virtual money has traditionally been locked down, in the sense that its use was strictly limited: If you earned points from Amazon, only you could use them, and you could exchange them for dollars only within the Amazon marketplace. Meanwhile, up to now, the only currencies you could use everywhere in an economy were state-issued currencies, like the dollar. But that distinction is eroding: After all, the value of a currency lies in what you can buy with it, not in the fact that a government says it's worth something. So if I want to buy a widget, and the only thing I can use to buy it is Widgetcash, then I am willing to trade dollars or euros or anything else for Widgetcash. When I buy something with Widgetcash, it doesn't go through any bank. That's why a digital wallet, loaded with your dollars, credit and loyalty points, is such a revolutionary technology -- it makes those transfers and transactions seamless and safe. Imagine you want to buy a shirt at Target. Your digital wallet can pay for it with dollars, your Target points or any other form of purchasing power that Target accepts. Wave your phone at the cash register, and the shirt is yours. That's the sort of thing that the current generation of digital wallets already promises; the only obstacle is adoption by retailers. But that won't be an obstacle for long. Frictionless exchange is a killer app. Some companies might lose value in their loyalty programs, but others will find enormous value in issuing their own currencies for advertising or data-tracking purposes, or even just because the creation of a successful virtual currency or digital wallet lets companies make money by making money. That's certainly Apple's bet. The revolution is what comes next: an exchange that connects and trades these different stores of value to find the most cost-efficient one to use, both within your wallet and between wallet users, worldwide. Let's say you want to buy an audiobook from Best Buy. It costs $16, or 1,000 My Best Buy points, or M.B.B.P.s. Your wallet contains several hundred dollars and 200 Best Buy points. The wallet software automatically determines that, at the current exchange rate between M.B.B.P.s and dollars, it is better to buy using the points. But then let's say you only have 50 M.B.B.P.s. The wallet system searches its clients and finds someone -- call her Hannah -- with enough M.B.B.P.s for the transaction. It buys the audiobook with her points and sends it to you, and sends Hannah dollars from your account. Following Bitcoin's protocol, the wallet software broadcasts these transactions to the network, and every wallet in the world updates the M.B.B.P.-to-dollar exchange rate. The idea is that you can buy anything, with anything. The wallet will find the best deal and execute it. In so doing, it will ignore the historical and cultural differences between dollars, points, coins and virtual property. It's all bits anyway. This sort of digital wallet raises difficult problems for regulators, who rely on institutional intermediaries like banks as the point for monitoring transactions. But a digital wallet can be a phone app; just like the cash in your pocket, it doesn't require accounts with any intermediary. A wallet app can be written by anyone, downloaded by anyone and secured and maintained by everyone. In this huge river of money, there is no narrow channel from which the state can divert flow into its own fields. Consider the tax implications. If you get caught cheating on your taxes and flee the country, the government could compel your bank to freeze your assets and cough up the money. But what if there's no bank? One concern that doesn't apply is transparency. Digital wallets don't hide trades or encourage criminal transactions. Using Bitcoin is much less secret than using hard cash. The government, and anybody else, can easily see the trades passing through our wallets, just as every trade in Bitcoin is visible at blockchain.info. Even if you try to hide who you are, network or traffic analysis can often de-anonymize you. The critical point is that, with a digital wallet, a government or bank can see the trades, but it will be harder to compel or block them. As exchange becomes less costly to perform, it becomes more costly to regulate. That means different things depending on your politics. You might celebrate the freedom the technology could bring to the 2.5 billion people in the world without adequate access to financial services, or you might worry about abuse by criminals. One thing that will not work is pretending that these technologies -- and their revolutionary implications -- don't exist. "
The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,"Opens on Friday Directed by Nicholas Mross 1 hour 36 minutes; not rated ''The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin'' explains what bitcoins are in plain English. It begins with Daniel Mross, a programmer in Pittsburgh who builds computers to ''mine'' bitcoins, the virtual currency that was introduced in 2009 and, in theory, provides an alternative to the banking system. Bitcoins are managed through a global, peer-verified network rather than a central entity like the Federal Reserve.  Beyond shots of Mr. Mross grilling burgers and joking about sending his baby to college on bitcoins, this largely optimistic documentary -- directed by his brother, Nicholas Mross -- explores the wider world of bitcoin entrepreneurship. The idea of a currency without a government appeals to libertarians. Bitcoins might help to integrate less developed countries into the global economy. The movie also acknowledges a dark side. There's an interview with a drug-dealing early adopter identified only as Mr. Bitcoin. Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, expresses concern with the potential for money laundering and terrorist financing. But the film never addresses the fundamental objection of economists like Brad DeLong and the New York Times Op-Ed columnist Paul Krugman, who question whether bitcoins constitute a stable store of value. The fates of several of the movie's bitcoin entrepreneurs are unlikely to send viewers rushing to exchange their dollars. But ''The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin'' nevertheless functions as an entertaining portrait of the unshakable optimism that governs what's been called a financial Wild West. "
The Long Cryptocon,"At the end of 2013 I wrote a post titled ""Bitcoin is evil,"" riffing off Charlie Stross's ""Why I want Bitcoin to die in a fire."" Charlie and I both keyed in on the obvious ideological agenda: Bitcoin fever was and is intimately tied up with libertarian anti-government fantasies.  So how's it going? Bitcoin prices are down by two-thirds from their peak, and Izabella Kaminska, who has stayed with the subject, finds the sad story of a gullible rube who appears to have impoverished himselfby believing in the hype. She comments: Some extremely wealthy libertarians have a lot to answer for if these sorts of ppl lose all due to believing in them  But this is nothing new. Back in 2012 Rick Perlstein published an eye-opening piece titled The Long Con, in which he documented the close association that has always existed between right-wing organizing and direct-mail commercial scams - in fact, it's pretty much impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins. Send us money to keep Obama from imposing Sharia law; invest in this sure-fire scheme to profit from the coming hyperinflation. Was Glenn Beck selling paranoid politics or Goldline? Yes. Bitcoin may be sold as a technical marvel, and it does indeed solve an interesting information problem - although it's not at all clear whether solving that problem has any economic value. But the psychology and sociology of the phenomenon are the same old same old. "
Price of Bitcoin Tumbles,"The price of Bitcoin fell nearly 20 percent this weekend to its lowest level of the year, prompting worries of a crash. ""As the price is going down, some of us are under immense psychological stress,"" one user posted on Reddit on Sunday. ""Please share how you cope with it.""  On Sunday afternoon, Bitcoin was trading at about $300,  up from a low of $286, according to Coindesk. Some contend that Bitcoin's price is irrelevant and that it does not reflect the virtual currency's true value. The virtual currency is still most popular among speculators and technology enthusiasts and has yet to find a general usage that will push it into the mainstream and help stabilize its price, they say. Bitcoin's recent price decline can appear jarring, but it is nothing new for the virtual currency. Indeed, some say the wild price swings have hindered its widespread adoption. Since it was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous programmer, or group of programmers, the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated unpredictably. After reaching its peak of about $1,150 late last year, the price has since been in a prolonged slide. In August, a flash crash briefly set the currency world on edge, as the price dipped on one exchange to just over $300 from nearly $500. Bitcoin ended that day down about 12 percent. ""For anyone complaining about the current price of Bitcoin, remember it has more than doubled over the last 12 months,"" Roger Ver, a Bitcoin enthusiast and investor, said in a Twitter message on Sunday. But even those most confident in Bitcoin are having trouble explaining the recent decline. The reason for the drop could be uncertainty over potential regulations. In July, New York became the first state to propose regulations for Bitcoin companies. The comment period for the regulations, which were introduced by the Department of Financial Services, is set to end on Oct. 21. Bitcoin has also attracted the attention of a number of other regulatory agencies in the United States, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service. The increase in the number of merchants now accepting Bitcoin could also be affecting the price. These merchants, including Overstock and Dell, use third-party payment processors like Coinbase to immediately convert Bitcoin to dollars. This means there are more Bitcoins in circulation, which could be helping to drive down the price. Some say simply that the market has been distracted with other events, including the Alibaba Group's initial public offering and the recent surge in the United States dollar. Against this backdrop, there have also been questions about whether Bitcoin can become more than a commodity. For that to happen, however, developers must find a way to harness its underlying technology to enable tasks that were previously difficult, expensive or impossible. These include cross-border transfers like remittances, which, under the current financial system, can be subject to high fees and long delays. Once Bitcoin finds a general usage, the price is likely to stabilize, they say. ""Right now, Bitcoin is in this transition stage where it's a commodity trying to become a currency,"" said Rafael Corrales, a partner at the venture capital firm Charles River Ventures, who has followed Bitcoin. ""When Bitcoin becomes a currency, it realizes its potential."" "
Blockchain Is Latest Bitcoin Start-Up to Lure Big Investment,"The bets that Silicon Valley is placing on Bitcoin are getting bigger. Even though concerns remain about the digital currency's staying power, Bitcoin start-ups are attracting more dollars from well-known venture capitalists. In the latest move, Blockchain, a Bitcoin wallet provider and software developer, is expected to announce on Tuesday that it has closed a roughly $30.5 million fund-raising round, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Wicklow Capital. The investment, raised from Blockchain's first round of outside financing, is one of the biggest in the digital currency industry to date. Since it was founded in 2011, Blockchain, which is based in Britain, has gained respect in the industry for adhering to the virtual currency's original philosophy of anonymity and decentralization. Roger Ver, a libertarian known in some circles as the Bitcoin Jesus, was the first backer and supporter of the company.  The price of one Bitcoin, which reached a peak of about $1,150 last year, fell over the weekend to its lowest point of the year after tumbling 20 percent, to about $286, according to CoinDesk, a virtual currency website. Bitcoin was trading on Monday evening at about $330. But despite the failure of some Bitcoin-related sites and new regulatory challenges, more than $250 million has been invested in Bitcoin companies, most of that in the last 12 months, according to Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm. ""Over the course of the next 10 years, Bitcoin is going to have a big impact,"" said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed who will join Blockchain's board. ""Where is the central nexus of value creation in this whole industry? It has to be the wallet,"" he said. Blockchain's financing round follows a spate of big investments in Bitcoin companies, particularly those that offer storage services. Coinbase, for example, secured $25 million last year in a financing round led by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Another Bitcoin company, Xapo, said in July that it had raised $40 million from investors including Greylock Partners and Index Ventures. Bitcoin has been slow to gain more widespread use in the mainstream. In developed countries, virtual money is still largely the plaything of technology enthusiasts and speculators, though some retailers and stores have trumpeted their acceptance of Bitcoin. In emerging markets, where some see enormous potential for Bitcoin, the infrastructure to process transactions simply does not exist. For Bitcoin to become more widely adopted, supporters say, the virtual currency must find a unique application that will take it beyond the realm of speculation. And for that to happen, companies must first build a robust platform, which is what Blockchain says it is trying to do. Blockchain has criticized other companies that essentially allow customers to bet on Bitcoin's price, a practice that it sees as straying from the currency's core mission. Blockchain says it tries to make it easier for people across the globe to use Bitcoin. The company has 2.3 million consumer wallets, making it among the most popular wallet services in the world. It has also developed a search engine that allows users to verify transactions quickly in the currency's public ledger, known as the Bitcoin blockchain. Most of the company's revenue comes from advertising. Peter Smith, the president of Blockchain, said the company planned to use its new financing to expand and to invest in developing markets. The company says it is working on software to make it easier to transfer Bitcoin. ""Right now, we're going into a period where it's not just enough to have Bitcoin be tantalizing,"" Mr. Smith said. ""We need Bitcoin to actually be useful."" It is this emphasis on improving the Bitcoin platform that seems to have attracted Blockchain's latest investors, a group that also included Mosaic Ventures and Richard Branson. In particular, investors said that they had been impressed with Blockchain's ability to establish itself as a key player in the industry without outside capital. ""Blockchain is far and away an early leader in Bitcoin,"" said Rafael Corrales, a partner at the venture capital firm CRV who personally invested in Blockchain's funding round. ""They're actually enabling the entire ecosystem.""                       "
Senate Adviser Jumps to Bitcoin Start-Up Coinbase,"The Bitcoin start-up Coinbase is bolstering its team as it seeks to deepen its engagement with regulators.  The company, one of the most popular digital wallet providers, has hired John Collins, a former adviser to the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, as its head of government affairs. Mr. Collins, who focused on digital currency, will work with lawmakers and public officials on policy decisions related to virtual money.  ""Bitcoin is an extremely powerful technology,"" said Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase. ""As the leader in the space, our main goal is to educate people who are going to form the regulations around it in its formative years so its potential remains."" Coinbase's moves comes as Bitcoin start-ups have been uncertain of what potential regulations will be coming. In July, for example, New York became the first state to issue proposed rules for digital currency companies. The public comment period on the BitLicense regulations is set to end next week. Bitcoin has also attracted the attention of other prominent regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Many Bitcoin companies have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward regulations. Some, like the start-up Coinapult, based in Panama City, have chosen to avoid operating in the United States until regulations become clearer. Others, like Circle, have been vocal about the effect ill-informed regulations could have on the industry. But as changes are proposed, Coinbase has tried to persuade regulators of its views on new Bitcoin policies. Its leaders have met with various government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCen, to help inform the discussions about digital currency, Mr. Ehrsam said.  Coinbase's desire to insert itself into the regulatory conversation is motivated, in part, by self-interest. As a wallet provider and payment processor, the company's core businesses are in some ways dependent on how government agencies decide to treat the currency. But the company insists it is trying to preserve the core values of Bitcoin and ensure that it continues to be an open platform that anyone can use. Mr. Collins previously worked for Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which held the first congressional hearing on digital currencies last November. At Coinbase, which is based in San Francisco, Mr. Collins said he wanted to ""build a larger coalition of folks"" who understood Bitcoin's potential, including government officials. Most important, he said, will be to educate regulators about Bitcoin so they adopt rules that protect customers without hampering innovation.  ""Coinbase's whole mission is to really make Bitcoin easy to understand and easy to use,"" Mr. Collins said. ""We really do believe that this technology has a lot of promise in this sector and other sectors.""                       "
Former S.E.C. Chairmain to Advise Two Prominent Bitcoin Companies,"Since it was introduced more than five years ago, Bitcoin has been viewed as a way to operate outside the realm of the existing financial system and the laws that govern it. But more recently, Bitcoin companies have been luring the financial establishment into their ranks. In what virtual currency supporters say is a sign that the Bitcoin industry is maturing, several well-known financial and legal experts have joined Bitcoin companies.  The latest, and arguably most prominent, is Arthur Levitt Jr., the longest-serving chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who will serve as an adviser to BitPay, the Bitcoin payment processor, and Vaurum, an exchange for institutional investors. The moves were announced on Tuesday. ""The brainpower behind Bitcoin technology and cryptocurrency is so deep and so challenging that I was attracted to it,"" Mr. Levitt said in an interview. ""The fact that so few people in America understand what Bitcoin is made me interested in the possibility of helping define it."" Mr. Levitt, who is 83, ran the S.E.C. from 1993 to 2001. He is now on the board of Motif Investing, an online investing platform, and Bloomberg L.P. and has also served as an adviser to Goldman Sachs and the private equity firm Carlyle Group. Mr. Levitt said he aims to help both BitPay and Vaurum build their businesses and encourage them to be transparent with regulators.  ""I personally believe that a company that deals with regulation has kind of a good housekeeper seal of approval,"" Mr. Levitt said. ""Even though some in the industry believe that this space shouldn't be regulated, I think a mature industry that really is an international factor must have the transparency that regulation can bring to it."" Mr. Levitt's decision to advise BitPay and Vaurum comes as Bitcoin is at something of a crossroads in its development. As the virtual currency has become more popular, government officials and regulators have started taking steps to bring it under their purview. Among others, the Internal Revenue Service, the S.E.C. and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have all acknowledged Bitcoin's growing presence in the mainstream. A number of highly publicized failures, like the collapse of Mt. Gox in February, have made the need for more stringent oversight especially apparent. Still, formal regulations have been somewhat slow to take hold. The New York Department of Financial Services, for instance, proposed rules for virtual currency companies in July. The initial comment period on the regulations ended last week after the department bowed to pressure from the Bitcoin industry to extend the time allowed for the public to submit their views on the rules. In the meantime, Bitcoin companies have begun to bring on government insiders and well-known legal experts to help them navigate the uncertainty. Coinbase, for example, recently hired John Collins, a former adviser to the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, as its head of government affairs. Mr. Collins, who focused on digital currency, will work with lawmakers and public officials on policy decisions related to virtual money. In September, Blockchain retained Marco Santori, a business lawyer in New York, as global policy counsel.  Part of the reason Bitcoin companies are adding these types of experts in-house is because they want to work closely with government officials to write rules that will allow for Bitcoin's continued success. Because digital currency is relatively unfamiliar, the Bitcoin industry is wary that regulations could go too far and stanch future innovation. Others recognize that regulations, if written with appropriate guidance, would discourage shady Bitcoin businesses, which could make everyday consumers more willing to use the virtual currency. ""Well-formulated regulation can help because you don't want everyone to start a Bitcoin business,"" said Jim Harper, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and an original member of the Department of Homeland Security's data privacy and integrity advisory committee, who joined the Bitcoin Foundation as global policy counsel earlier this year.  ""We want the Bitcoin ecosystem to be one that's safe to use.""                        "
Mt. Gox Bankruptcy Trustee to Tap Kraken Exchange in Repaying Creditors,"Customers of Mt. Gox, once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, are closer to getting back at least some of the money they lost this year when it shut down and announced that their funds had gone missing.  The bankruptcy trustee for Mt. Gox, which is based in Tokyo, is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will work with a California-based Bitcoin exchange, Kraken, to return the money left in the estate to the company's 127,000 creditors. The decision is a somewhat unexpected development in the saga of Mt. Gox's collapse, which rocked the upstart world of Bitcoin. When Mt. Gox initially went down in February, the company's chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said the company had either lost or been robbed of 850,000 coins, which was worth about $500 million at the time. Mr. Karpeles said that 100,000 of the missing coins belonged to the exchange but the rest were owned by customers. A few weeks after Mt. Gox shut down, Mr. Karpeles announced he had found about 200,000 coins that he had thought were missing, leaving 650,000 still unaccounted for. Mr. Karpeles has said that hackers appeared to have stolen the money. Yet while several law enforcement authorities in Japan and the United States have reportedly been investigating, they have produced few answers. As part of its mandate from the bankruptcy trustee, Kraken will participate in the investigation. The price of a Bitcoin has dropped by half since Mt. Gox closed but has recently stabilized at just under $400. The 200,000 coins discovered after the exchange shut down appear to represent the bulk of the estate's assets, though the trustee has not recently commented on his success in recovering missing assets. In a July filing, the company said that in addition to 202,100 coins, it had 779 million yen, or about $6.6 million, in other assets. The court-appointed trustee previously suggested that the remaining coins could be converted into dollars before being returned. But many creditors resisted, worried that the conversion of all that Bitcoin into dollars would depress the digital currency's value. Several companies in the virtual-currency industry vied to take over either the business or assets of Mt. Gox, or both, an attractive proposition given the size of its customer base. A group called Sunlot Holdings, led by John Betts, a former Wall Street executive, said in March that it had signed an agreement with Mr. Karpeles to revive the exchange. But that deal quickly fell apart. The choice of Kraken is notable because it is not one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges. The company has catered primarily to European customers, through a partnership with a German bank, and recently opened in Japan. But Kraken has developed a reputation for taking a careful approach that has kept it in good standing with regulators. The job of reimbursing Mt. Gox creditors should be a boon for Kraken because they will most likely be required to open an account with Kraken to get their money back. That should lead to a significant increase in the number of people with Kraken accounts, and some of them could continue using the exchange. "
Second Bitcoin Auction Draws Fewer Bidders,"Investors' enthusiasm for Bitcoin may be waning. The United States Marshals Service said on Thursday that 11 registered bidders had taken part in the auction and that the agency had received 27 bids, far fewer than the 45 bidders and 63 bids the agency received in the first Bitcoin auction in June. The winner, or winners, of the second auction will be notified on Friday by 5 p.m. Eastern time. The auction on Thursday was for 50,000 Bitcoins, worth around $19 million, seized in connection with the now-defunct online marketplace Silk Road. The site was shut down in October 2013 after the authorities said it was a marketplace for illegal drugs and other illicit activities. In the auction five months ago, the Marshals Service sold nearly 30,000 Bitcoins.   The agency declined to comment further on Thursday.  Some of the same prominent investors who participated in the Marshals Service's first auction again submitted bids this time. SecondMarket and Pantera Bitcoin both allowed customers to bid through syndicates. The venture capitalist Tim Draper, who was the first auction's sole winner, said he planned to participate in Thursday's auction. But some bidders in the first auction chose to sit out Thursday's auction. The Bitcoin Shop did not participate in the auction. Nor did Rangeley Capital. Alex Waters, the chief executive and co-founder of Coin Apex, who appeared to send his bid live on Bloomberg Television during the first auction, also did not bid this time. Coinbase, a Bitcoin payment processor, declined to comment. The results of the Marshals Service's first auction may have dissuaded bidders from participating in the second auction, said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. ""The big difference is that people already saw how last time went.""  Though the Marshals Service did not announce the price of Mr. Draper's winning bid, it is widely assumed among Bitcoin investors that he bid above Bitcoin's market price at the time. As a result, some investors who had hoped to get a bargain last time saw little point in participating in this auction. Bitcoin is now trading at around $370, down from about $570 at the start of the June auction.  ""Unless you can get a steep discount to market, it's a lot of risk,"" said Charles Allen, the chief executive of the Bitcoin Shop. ""If we're not going to get a discount, what's the point?"" Winklevoss Capital, a start-up venture firm started by the Winklevoss twins, did not participate in either auction. ""We don't generally participate in auctions where there is limited information, a high likelihood of a winner's curse and a low likelihood of achieving an efficient price. That being said, anything can happen and we wish the participants the best of luck,"" Cameron Winklevoss said in a statement on Thursday. The latest auction is for Bitcoins found on computer hardware belonging to Ross Ulbricht, who is accused of creating Silk Road. Prosecutors and Mr. Ulbricht agreed in January that the government could sell the virtual currency it had seized. The government's two auctions represent only a small fraction of the total amount of Bitcoins seized in connection with Silk Road. Including 144,336 Bitcoins found on computer hardware belonging to Mr. Ulbricht, the government has recovered 173,991 Bitcoins. A spokeswoman for the Marshals Service, Lynzey Donahue, said in an email at the time the second auction was announced that the agency anticipated selling the remaining Bitcoins, but that ""no exact dates have been determined.""                       "
Venture Capitalist Tim Draper Wins Small Piece of Bitcoin Auction,"When the United States Marshals Service opened its second Bitcoin auction on Thursday, some bidders were not optimistic about their chances. After all, a single bidder had won all of the nearly 30,000 Bitcoins in the government's first auction in June, leaving the rest of the participants discouraged. But the Bitcoin king of June ended up just a bit player today. On Friday, the venture capitalist Timothy C. Draper, the first auction's sole victor, said he had won just one block of 2,000 Bitcoins, a fraction of the 50,000 the Marshals Service had put up for sale. Mr. Draper bid on behalf of his venture firm, Draper Associates.  ""I will have to buy some more Bitcoin on the open market to fulfill my commitment to the new batch of Boost companies,"" Mr. Draper said in an email. Draper Associates had teamed up with Boost VC, the Bitcoin start-up accelerator founded by his son, Adam Draper, to invest 300 Bitcoins in every company that works with Boost. The Marshals Service said it would notify all winning bidders by 5 p.m. ""We are unable to confirm, deny or make any further announcements until the entire award process has concluded, including the completion of required financial transactions,"" Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the Marshals Service, said in an emailed statement on Friday. Winners must initiate wire transfers to pay for their Bitcoins by 2 p.m. on Monday. Thursday's auction of 50,000 Bitcoins, worth around $19 million, was the second held by the Marshals Service for Bitcoins seized in connection with the defunct online marketplace Silk Road. In June, it sold nearly 30,000 of the Bitcoins seized from Silk Road, which was shut down in October 2013 after authorities said it was an online marketplace for illegal drugs and other illicit activities. Because of the slump in Bitcoin's price since the June auction, when it was trading around $600, the total value for sale in both auctions was about equal. The Marshals Service said on Thursday that only 11 registered bidders took part in its second auction, far fewer than the 45 bidders who participated in the first auction. It received 27 bids this time, compared with 63 bids in June. Some of the same bidders who participated in the first auction also submitted bids on Thursday. Along with Mr. Draper, SecondMarket and Pantera Capital both allowed investors to bid through syndicates. SecondMarket said its syndicate received 104 bids from eight bidders, significantly fewer than the 186 bids from 42 bidders in the first auction. Likewise, Dan Morehead, the founder of Pantera Capital, said fewer investors participated in his syndicate this time, though he declined to give any figures. Mirror, previously called Vaurum, also participated in the second auction with a syndicate. SecondMarket and Pantera declined to comment on Friday evening. There are still nearly 94,000 Bitcoins to be auctioned by the government.  A spokeswoman for the Marshals Service, Lynzey Donahue, said in an email at the time the second auction was announced that the agency anticipated selling the remaining Bitcoins ""in the coming months,"" but that ""no exact dates have been determined."" Since the Marshals Service announced the second auction in November, Bitcoin's price has held steady at around $375, according to CoinDesk. The auction appeared to have little effect on the price on Friday. In the days after the first auction in June, the price of Bitcoin climbed to about $655 from around $570. "
SecondMarket Nearly Sweeps Latest Bitcoin Auction,"SecondMarket, an upstart exchange based in New York, nearly swept the government's latest Bitcoin auction, winning 48,000 of the 50,000 Bitcoins for sale. The firm's syndicate, which received 104 bids from eight bidders, won all but one of the auction's 20 Bitcoin blocks. ""Obviously, we're very thrilled with the results,"" said Brendan O'Connor, the head of SecondMarket's trading division. SecondMarket was started in 2004 by Barry Silbert, who runs the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a Bitcoin investment fund.   The venture capitalist Timothy C. Draper, who won all of the nearly 30,000 Bitcoins in the United States Marshals Service's first auction in June, said on Friday that he had won only 2,000 Bitcoins in last week's auction. Mr. Draper bid on behalf of his venture firm Draper Associates. The auction on Thursday of 50,000 Bitcoins, worth about $19 million, was the second held by the Marshals Service for Bitcoins seized in connection with the defunct online bazaar Silk Road. In June, it sold nearly 30,000 Bitcoins seized from Silk Road, which was shut down in October 2013 after the authorities said it was an online marketplace for illegal drugs and other illicit activities. A number of other prominent Bitcoin players, including Pantera Capital and Mirror, previously called Vaurum, also participated in last week's auction. Still, the latest sale raised questions about whether investor appetite for Bitcoin was subsiding. The Marshals Service said last week that only 11 bidders participated in Thursday's auction, a sharp decrease from the first auction, when 45 bidders took part. The service received 27 unique bids this time, compared with 63 in June. And at the time of the second auction, Bitcoin was trading at about $370, down from its peak of around $1,150 a year ago and about $200 below its price at the start of the first auction in June, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. It was trading just below $350 on Tuesday morning. ""The demand is starting to dry up,"" said David L. Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business. ""I think a lot of the excitement may have bled out of investors."" Bitcoin's wild price fluctuations, which analysts had said were driven in part by speculative trading, have all but disappeared in recent months. This price stability, in turn, might have further discouraged opportunistic, short-term investors from participating in the auction, Mr. Yermack said. SecondMarket's first syndicate, for instance, received 186 bids from 42 bidders for the government's June auction, far more than its second syndicate. Mr. O'Connor said fewer first-time investors participated. Others in the Bitcoin industry, however, dismissed the notion that the virtual currency is no longer as an attractive investment. Instead, they say, the fact that fewer bidders participated in the second auction was a sign that the Bitcoin market was becoming more liquid.  ""Volumes have picked up, so there are other ways to get larger trades relatively easily,"" said Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics who studies alternative currencies. ""The Bitcoin market has matured."" Bidders in the Marshals Service's second auction had a six-hour window on Thursday to submit sealed bids for the Bitcoins, which had been broken up into blocks.  The government's two auctions represent only a small portion of the total amount of Bitcoin seized in connection with Silk Road. Including 144,336 Bitcoins found on computer hardware belonging to Ross Ulbricht, who is accused of creating Silk Road, the government has recovered 173,991 Bitcoins. A spokeswoman for the Marshals Service, Lynzey Donahue, said in an email at the time the second auction was announced that the agency anticipated selling the remaining Bitcoins ""in the coming months,"" but that ""no exact dates have been determined."" The promise of at least one more auction, however, has some in the Bitcoin industry worried. ""Bitcoin is in a bit of a holding patter, or a bit of a lull, and people may think that there's more downward pressure on the price,"" said Mr. Hileman, the economic historian. ""Now, we're onto the harsh reality of who wants to buy into another auction."" "
American Express Chief Ken Chenault Sees Potential in Bitcoin's Technology,"Many Bitcoin supporters hope that the virtual currency will one day transform the payments system by enabling the nearly instantaneous transfer of value across the globe.  But Kenneth I. Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, isn't quite ready to give in to digital money.  ""The reality is we compete with any form of payments"" Mr. Chenault said on Thursday at the DealBook conference in Manhattan.""Everyone focuses on the displacement of Bitcoin and the credit card industry."" But, he added, ""there's a reason credit cards were invented."" In particular, he said, people want the ability to defer payments.  The Bitcoin industry has taken aim at the relatively high transaction fees that credit card companies charge merchants. Virtual currency supporters argue that Bitcoin would allow these businesses to save money, which they could then pass on to their customers. On the other hand, opponents argue that credit cards, unlike Bitcoin, offer more protection against fraud. Though some of Mr. Chenault's peers have been far more skeptical of Bitcoin, his argument is another indication that the traditional banking industry has yet to fully embrace digital currency.  In an interview on CNBC in January, for instance, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, called Bitcoin ""a terrible store of value"" that could be ""replicated over and over.""  Still, Mr. Chenault said he saw promise in Bitcoin's underlying technology. ""The protocol of Bitcoin is going to be important,"" he said. Alternative currencies, he added, are like the music service Napster, and later iTunes, with their potential to drive industry change.  ""I don't know how this is going to evolve,"" Mr. Chenault said about new forms of money and the payments system. ""I think there's room for a lot of players."" "
"Ex-JPMorgan Executive to Join Circle, a Digital Currency Start-Up","A former JPMorgan Chase executive is set to join a digital currency start-up, part of a fledgling industry that is seeking to topple the traditional financial system. Paul Camp, who led JPMorgan's global transaction services business before leaving the bank in July, is joining Circle Internet Financial, a start-up that processes digital transactions. Mr. Camp will serve as the company's chief financial officer and corporate treasurer.  ""We've been interested in trying to find an additional partner on the team with highly relevant leadership capacity,"" said Jeremy Allaire, Circle's founder and chief executive. ""Paul had grown up in that core payments infrastructure. That was really a key piece of what we were looking for."" At JPMorgan, Mr. Camp oversaw the division responsible for holding and moving money for big companies and organizations. Previously, he had served in a similar role at Deutsche Bank, where he helped establish the bank as a leader in euro settlements and payments.   Big banks like JPMorgan have long dominated the business of global transactions. Now, a number of start-ups, including Circle - which allows customers to buy, sell, store and transfer Bitcoin - are looking to upend the established system of transferring money. ""Our view is that consumer finance, what people think of as retail finance - that arena is ripe for disruption,"" Mr. Allaire said. ""Bitcoin is absolutely a core platform and asset format that we are dependent on to build this business."" Circle, based in Boston, has secured $26 million in venture financing, including from the venture firm Accel Partners. Although Mr. Camp's move is unlikely to signal a diaspora of bank executives to digital currency start-ups, his decision to join Circle is another indication that leaders in the traditional financial services industry are now taking digital money seriously.  Mr. Camp also appears to have broken away from JPMorgan's stance on virtual currency. Unlike some financial institutions, which have approached Bitcoin with caution, JPMorgan has come out against virtual currency. In an interview with CNBC in January, Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, expressed particular disdain, calling Bitcoin ""a terrible store of value"" that could be ""replicated over and over."" ""The question isn't whether we accept it,"" Mr. Dimon said. ""The question is, do we even participate in people who facilitate Bitcoin?"" It is this negative perception that Mr. Allaire is hoping to sway, and, he said, he is looking to Mr. Camp to play a big role.  ""We need to build banking relationship all around the world to offer our products,"" Mr. Allaire said. ""His background and skill set will be really helpful.""                       "
Time Inc. Begins Accepting Bitcoin Payments,"A large magazine publisher is trying to stay on the digital cutting edge. On Tuesday, Time Inc. announced that it would accept payments in Bitcoin for certain subscriptions. Like many companies that have started accepting Bitcoin, Time Inc. has teamed up with Coinbase, a popular Bitcoin wallet, to process the transactions.   ""This pilot program will give Bitcoin users a seamless and simple way to purchase subscriptions,"" Lynne Biggar, the executive vice president for consumer marketing and revenue at Time Inc., said in a statement. ""We hope to expand our partnership with Coinbase in the coming months to create more opportunities to provide greater value to our customers."" Consumers can purchase subscriptions for Fortune, Health, This Old House and Travel and Leisure. Other Time Inc. publications, including People, Sports Illustrated and Food and Wine, have been excluded for now. Many companies that have begun allowing users to transact with Bitcoin have been rooted in technology, including Overstock, Dell and Expedia. Time Inc.'s decision is a sign that even once-traditional businesses are now seeing opportunity in Bitcoin. Digital currency, for instance, would give consumers a faster way to pay for subscriptions. Bitcoin transactions also cost merchants less than credit card payments in processing fees.  ""For a major publisher like Time Inc. to embrace Bitcoin sends an important message to both its readers and to the broader media community,"" Brian Armstrong, the chief executive and co-founder of Coinbase, said in a statement.  In a separate blog post, Coinbase said Time Inc.'s decision to accept Bitcoin would help the publishing industry ""understand and explore new business models that can be enabled with Bitcoin,"" including micropayments. The idea is that consumers could one day pay for individual articles or videos with Bitcoin. Time Inc., which says it reaches 130 million consumers each month, has been criticized for holding on too strongly to its past, and accepting Bitcoin may be part of the company's attempt to be seen as hipper and younger. And while Bitcoin will probably not solve the magazine industry's wider problems, including declining subscriptions and sliding revenue, Time Inc.'s decision is obviously already generating publicity.

Chinese E-Commerce Giant Alibaba to Ban Bitcoins on Its Sites,"LONDON - The Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group said on Wednesday that it not allow the sale of Bitcoins on its website. Alibaba becomes the latest in a growing chorus of governments and businesses to raise questions about Bitcoin, which has seen its value rise dramatically as more people embrace virtual currency.  ""In the interest of consumer protection, Taobao Marketplace has banned the listing or sale of Bitcoins over the platform,"" said Florence Shin, an Alibaba spokeswoman.  Bitcoin wasn't an accepted form of payment on the website; the vast majority of transactions are processed through Taobao's Alipay system. But some merchants still offered to accept Bitcoin as payments for their products or sold the virtual currency. The ban goes in effect on Jan. 14. The announcement comes as Alibaba is considering an initial public offering as early as this year. Wall Street is anticipating that the Chinese company could be valued at more than $150 billion. Alibaba's decision also follows a move by China last month to ban the nation's banks from accepting Bitcoins as a currency over concerns about potential money laundering and its potential threat to financial stability. In a notice in December, the People's Bank of China and other agencies said that Bitcoin was ""not a currency in the real meaning of the word"" but rather was a ""virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency."" The notice went on, ""Nor can, or should, it be circulated or used in the marketplace as a currency."" Bitcoin was created in 2009 and has a limited supply. As a result, the price of those units has increased as investors have bet on a continued growing demand for the virtual currency.  "
Five Lessons From Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is not over yet. But the pseudo-currency is close enough to collapse to merit an early retrospective. My prediction is controversial. Many fervent fans are convinced that this government-free currency is for real. Their ardor may keep it going for a while, but equally Bitcoin could disappear quickly - that's the way with speculative bubbles. So now is the moment to learn some economic lessons before the whole phenomenon is forgotten. Here are five:  Money Without Government Appeals to People Without Law   Legal tender has the backing of the issuing state. The government has a proprietary interest in maintaining a reliable currency. It also has the necessary powers to do so. It can regulate lending institutions, pursue fraud and create new money to keep the system afloat. Bitcoin has none of that protection. On the contrary, governments are either hostile or hands off. For anyone in the legal economy, the lack of official support is a significant negative. For anyone in the illegal economy, though, the extra-legal status is a positive. Unsurprisingly, the only real business actually to rely on Bitcoin - not merely issue press releases about planning to accept the tokens - has been Silk Road, a now-closed electronic exchange for illegal drugs.  Speculative Fever Can Alight on Almost Anything  Bitcoin is a pretty unlikely target. After all, the more the value of the would-be currency changes, the less it looks like a real currency, so the more liable it is to lose all value whenever the speculators get tired or wise. David Yermack of New York University's Stern School of Business explained in a recent paper that the unstable value of Bitcoin - in the last three months, its dollar price has quadrupled, then almost halved and increased by about half - leaves it without two of the three basic attributes of a currency. Bitcoin is neither a relatable store of value nor a helpful unit of account. Mr. Yermack kindly says that Bitcoin satisfies the third attribute: It can be, and occasionally has been, a medium of exchange. But if speculators were thinking clearly, they would stay away from any supposed money that banks don't accept. After all, banks are involved in almost all exchanges in today's economies.  The Current Monetary System Is Worth Complaining About  Bitcoin is the wrong answer to a good question: What can be done to make the monetary system less crazy? After so many banks needed to be rescued in 2008, and after five subsequent years of weird monetary policy, it's clear that the question is legitimate. Something is badly wrong. People can be excused for thinking that governments, including central banks, have run the money system so poorly that nongovernmental money might be better, but that is the wrong answer. The only practical right answer is to improve the government-run monetary system. Central banks seem to have learned how to reduce consumer price volatility, which was the scourge of the first decades of purely fiat money. Now, the monetary authorities need to figure out how to reduce the volatility of asset prices, credit flows and foreign exchange rates. And the base interest rates should be high enough to give savers a real return.  Money Is Misunderstood  Admittedly, money is complicated. It is a social token as well as an economic tool. It is a store of value, but its own value shifts constantly. It is considered a safe and solid asset - ""like money in the bank"" - but banks cannot really promise always to make good on legitimate demands to liquidate accounts. I sympathize with anyone who does not want to try to understand how money works, but monetary ignorance can be dangerous. Many Bitcoin investors will find that out, to their personal cost. The whole economy paid dearly for similar misunderstandings by central bankers and regulators. They did not really consider the risks of speculation and wild credit creation by nongovernmental financial institutions. If they had, there would have been no need afterward to turn so many of them into quasi-governmental financial institutions.  Too Much Entrepreneurial Energy Is Wasted  Bitcoin is basically idle speculation, but it has inspired a great deal of skilled work. This small business - total value of a mere $100 million a year ago, now about $10 billion - has generated scores of websites and seemingly unlimited quantities of enthusiastic and evangelistic commentary. The original programmer, the producers of new Bitcoins and the creators of a remarkable number of sophisticated Bitcoin exchanges are all are very good. A society in which no project ever attracted this sort of attention, intelligence and ambition would be moribund. The Bitcoin mania shows that ours is still quite alive. But it is a bit discouraging to see so much of what is good in our economy directed to something so misguided. Edward Hadas is economics editor at Reuters Breakingviews.

Bitcoin a Fool's Gold Standard,"I cannot judge whether Bitcoin represents a technological breakthrough, but I am confident that the pseudocurrency's popularity shows widespread economic amnesia. If Bitcoin ever became a real currency, it would suffer from the crippling problems of the gold standard. The underlying problem is the belief that Bitcoin's independence from government is a good thing. This libertarian notion could hardly be more wrong. Money is a common good for the whole society, and in the contemporary world governments are the pre-eminent social guardians.  It is true that under dire circumstances people might have to resort to an inferior monetary substitute. If a government collapsed or totally trashed the monetary system, then some privately issued money could be the least bad alternative. In such apocalyptic times, though, a software protocol that relies on secure electronic communications would not be first choice. Gold, which is tangible and not subject to hacking, is more plausible. So are old baseball cards. But for the sake of argument, assume that Bitcoin or something like it did actually become the leading currency in a monetary dystopia. People would learn soon enough why nongovernment money works badly. Deflation is an obvious issue. Price declines are inevitable when a finite supply of Bitcoin money, a feature of the software, meets an expanding supply of purchased goods and services. That would be uncomfortable. Consumers might delay purchases as they wait for prices to fall, workers might chafe at regular annual wage cuts, and creditors would be even worse off. But in itself, deflation does not discredit nongovernment money. People and banks could adjust to the new monetary reality, as the Japanese have to the country's 0.3 percent average annual decline in consumer prices since 1998. Alternatively, a different nondeflationary electronic currency could be created; one which added steadily to the supply of money. If the addition was in line with gross domestic product growth, prices and wages could be roughly flat in normal times. Yet times are not always normal, and neither Bitcoin nor some putative ""growcoin"" - nor any sort of limited-supply money - can cope with unexpected bad news. Historians of money know the story well. Before governments started to issue money purely by fiat, the supply of money was limited by the supply of gold or silver, supplemented by public or private notes that were theoretically backed by some valuable asset. Whenever people decided to hoard their hard currency and reject paper notes, there was trouble. The spur to the monetary fear might be war, crop failure or a busted financial institution. Whatever the cause, the sudden increase in caution automatically created a sudden decrease in the money for spending. The economic theorists of hard money said that wages and prices would also fall automatically, so the shrunken supply of currency would still be adequate to keep the economy running. In practice, the adjustment was always much too slow. Goods became unaffordable, unemployment rose and production fell. The British economist John Maynard Keynes called it the paradox of thrift. He was analyzing the Great Depression of the 1930s, the last big money-prodded general decline. Keynes taught, and the world learned, that governments could and should counter bad news by ensuring that there was always enough money available to keep spending constant. As the slow recovery from the 2008 recession shows, the policies have not always worked perfectly. But they could not work at all in a Bitcoin economy, because there would be no authority that could decide how much new money to print. Indeed, the knowledge that governments could not create new Bitcoins in a crisis would only increase thrift. Just as in the 19th century, a little bit of bad news would spawn a large economic crisis. The problem would be worse now than then, because the economy relies so much more on bank-created credit. Whether banks use dollars, euros or Bitcoins, they lend out most of their deposits. The loans increase the supply of spendable money, because the lent sum is added to the total while the deposits that fund the loans are not subtracted. The arrangement is always potentially unstable. If the borrowers cannot repay too many of the loans or if depositors want to withdraw their money too fast, the bank may fall short of funds. A failure, and an ensuing panic, can only be avoided if banks can find cash elsewhere. The ultimate ""elsewhere"" is always the government, which can create new funds out of thin air. Government rescues are not ideal, but better than any known alternative. In a Bitcoin or growcoin world, the government would have nothing to offer. Frequent bank runs and financial panics would be unavoidable. Charitably, the popular interest in Bitcoin can be interpreted as a sign of ignorance of economic history. More realistically, it is a sad statement of a loss of faith in a monetary system that has not worked as well as promised. Unfortunately, Bitcoin is no more than a high-tech version of an even worse system. Edward Hadas is economics editor at Reuters Breakingviews.

The Age of 'Infopolitics',"We are in the midst of a flood of alarming revelations about information sweeps conducted by government agencies and private corporations concerning the activities and habits of ordinary Americans. After the initial alarm that accompanies every leak and news report, many of us retreat to the status quo, quieting ourselves with the thought that these new surveillance strategies are not all that sinister, especially if, as we like to say, we have nothing to hide.  One reason for our complacency is that we lack the intellectual framework to grasp the new kinds of political injustices characteristic of today's information society. Everyone understands what is wrong with a government's depriving its citizens of freedom of assembly or liberty of conscience. Everyone (or most everyone) understands the injustice of government-sanctioned racial profiling or policies that produce economic inequality along color lines. But though nearly all of us have a vague sense that something is wrong with the new regimes of data surveillance, it is difficult for us to specify exactly what is happening and why it raises serious concern, let alone what we might do about it.Our confusion is a sign that we need a new way of thinking about our informational milieu. What we need is a concept of infopolitics that would help us understand the increasingly dense ties between politics and information. Infopolitics encompasses not only traditional state surveillance and data surveillance, but also ""data analytics"" (the techniques that enable marketers at companies like Target to detect, for instance, if you are pregnant), digital rights movements (promoted by organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation), online-only crypto-currencies (like Bitcoin or Litecoin), algorithmic finance (like automated micro-trading) and digital property disputes (from peer-to-peer file sharing to property claims in the virtual world of Second Life). These are only the tip of an enormous iceberg that is drifting we know not where. Surveying this iceberg is crucial because atop it sits a new kind of person: the informational person. Politically and culturally, we are increasingly defined through an array of information architectures: highly designed environments of data, like our social media profiles, into which we often have to squeeze ourselves. The same is true of identity documents like your passport and individualizing dossiers like your college transcripts. Such architectures capture, code, sort, fasten and analyze a dizzying number of details about us. Our minds are represented by psychological evaluations, education records, credit scores. Our bodies are characterized via medical dossiers, fitness and nutrition tracking regimens, airport security apparatuses. We have become what the privacy theorist Daniel Solove calls ""digital persons."" As such we are subject to infopolitics (or what the philosopher Grégoire Chamayou calls ""datapower,"" the political theorist Davide Panagia ""datapolitik"" and the pioneering thinker Donna Haraway ""informatics of domination""). Today's informational person is the culmination of developments stretching back to the late 19th century. It was in those decades that a number of early technologies of informational identity were first assembled. Fingerprinting was implemented in colonial India, then imported to Britain, then exported worldwide. Anthropometry - the measurement of persons to produce identifying records - was developed in France in order to identify recidivists. The registration of births, which has since become profoundly important for initiating identification claims, became standardized in many countries, with Massachusetts pioneering the way in the United States before a census initiative in 1900 led to national standardization. In the same era, bureaucrats visiting rural districts complained that they could not identify individuals whose names changed from context to context, which led to initiatives to universalize standard names. Once fingerprints, biometrics, birth certificates and standardized names were operational, it became possible to implement an international passport system, a social security number and all other manner of paperwork that tells us who someone is. When all that paper ultimately went digital, the reams of data about us became radically more assessable and subject to manipulation, which has made us even more informational. We like to think of ourselves as somehow apart from all this information. We are real - the information is merely about us. But what is it that is real? What would be left of you if someone took away all your numbers, cards, accounts, dossiers and other informational prostheses? Information is not just about you - it also constitutes who you are. We understandably do not want to see ourselves as bits and bytes. But unless we begin conceptualizing ourselves in this way, we leave it to others to do it for us. Many government agencies and giant corporations are all too eager to continue the work of producing detailed data profiles of all of us. These profiles may be produced for varying purposes (targeting terrorists is not the same work as targeting consumers), but they all involve informational pictures of who we are - as well as who we can become. These agencies and corporations will continue producing new visions of you and me, and they will do so without our input if we remain stubbornly attached to antiquated conceptions of selfhood that keep us from admitting how informational we already are. We need a concept of infopolitics precisely because we have become infopersons. What should we do about our Internet and phone patterns' being fastidiously harvested and stored away in remote databanks where they await inspection by future algorithms developed at the National Security Agency, Facebook, credit reporting firms like Experian and other new institutions of information and control that will come into existence in future decades? What bits of the informational you will fall under scrutiny? The political you? The sexual you? What next-generation McCarthyisms await your informational self? And will those excesses of oversight be found in some Senate subcommittee against which we democratic citizens might hope to rise up in revolt - or will they lurk among algorithmic automatons that silently seal our fates in digital filing systems? As soon as we learn to see ourselves and our politics as informational, we can begin to see the importance of surveillance reforms of the sort proposed by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat  of Oregon, as well as the wisdom implicit in the transgressions of ""hacktivists"" whose ethics call for anonymity and untraceability. Despite their decidedly different political sensibilities, what links together the likes of Senator Wyden and the international hacker network known as Anonymous is that they respect the severity of what is at stake in our information. They understand that information is a site for the call of justice today, alongside more quintessential battlefields like liberty of thought and equality of opportunity. Willingness to see ourselves as informational persons subject to informational powers could help us bring into view what will be required to protect the many individual rights and social ties now inhering in all those bits and bytes. Colin Koopman is an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Oregon, where he is also a resident scholar at the Wayne Morse Center for Law and Politics. He is the author of ""Genealogy as Critique"" and ""Pragmatism as Transition,"" and is at work on a book about infopolitics.   "
"In Praise of Bitcoin, With Little Regard for Banks","A hearing on the regulatory future of Bitcoin on Tuesday turned into a forum on the shortcomings of the traditional banking industry. The hearing, called by New York State's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, gave five Bitcoin advocates the chance to enumerate what they view as the advantages Bitcoin could provide over current systems of moving money around the world. ""Solutions don't really come from the current industry,"" said Cameron Winklevoss, who, with his twin brother, Tyler, has invested in Bitcoin companies. They were early players in Facebook.  Even Mr. Lawsky got in some digs when he complained that it takes three days for his bank to transfer money to pay a credit card bill at the same bank.  When Mr. Lawsky asked about efforts by banks to create their own Bitcoin alternatives, Fred Wilson, a leading venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures, said ""no one is going to build on top of JPMorgan Chase's Bitcoin."" JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, went on the record last week and played  down the potential of virtual currencies like Bitcoin, which have become so hot over the last year. Bitcoin aficionados argue that digital money could provide a way to circumvent the transaction fees and penalties charged by banks. The hearing underscored just how ambitious Bitcoin advocates are in their desire to create a new payment system. For his part, Mr. Lawsky showed openness to regulations that would encourage the new technology. ""We need to think internally about how we can be a more modern, digital regulator,"" he said. Mr. Lawsky has proposed the creation of a BitLicense for virtual currency firms, but the concept rarely came up on Tuesday. Regulators have so far been reluctant to come up with specific rules for virtual currencies or even to specify who should be supervising them. Mr. Lawsky indicated on Tuesday that he hopes to make New York the first state to provide regulatory clarity. The panel on Tuesday morning was the first of five during a two-day hearing, and some of the other testimony may provide a more critical look at Bitcoin. But even Tuesday morning's panel was not entirely friendly. The panelists suggested they were suspicious of any regulations that would force virtual currency start-ups to follow the same money-laundering laws imposed on traditional banks. ""If that's the condition of a company starting, than maybe we don't do it in the United States,"" said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, a firm that invests in Bitcoin companies. But Mr. Lawsky and his colleagues said that the industry was going to need to find a way to operate under the same laws as other financial firms. ""If the choice for regulators is to permit money laundering on the one hand, or to permit innovation on the other, we are always going to choose squelching the money laundering first,"" he said. Hanging over the hearing was the criminal complaint unsealed on Monday against a leading Bitcoin entrepreneur, Charles Shrem, and a business partner, who were accused of helping people buy drugs online using virtual currencies. During the hearing, the Bitcoin Foundation, where Mr. Shrem was vice chairman, put out a statement indicating that Mr. Shrem had resigned on Tuesday. Mr. Lawsky said the arrest shows the possibility that virtual currencies could be used to smooth the way for illegal activity. But the people testifying said that Mr. Shrem's arrest showed that current laws are enough to stop wrongdoing in the Bitcoin universe, particularly because all transactions are recorded on a public ledger. In the end, the panelists did much more than defend Bitcoin - they spoke about it as an almost messianic force for good in the world.""It's about freedom, ultimately, and whether you want to live in a society that embraces innovation and free speech and freedom or not,"" Mr. Wilson said. A minute later, Tyler Winklevoss echoed that: ""Back to what Fred said: Bitcoin is freedom. It's very American."" "
Law Enforcement Strikes Back in Bitcoin Hearing,"Law enforcement officials testified on Wednesday that virtual currencies like Bitcoin have opened up new avenues for crime that government has not been able to keep up with. The most forceful statements came from a prosecutor with the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, Richard B. Zabel, during the second day of hearings about virtual currencies held by New York's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky. Mr. Zabel went through a list of six ways in which virtual currencies are more prone to crime than current forms of money transfer, including the ease with which money can be laundered over borders at the click of a mouse.  The testimony of Mr. Zabel and Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, was a blow to Bitcoin advocates who have said that digital money carries no more risk than ordinary money and should not be treated with harsher regulations. Both Mr. Zabel and Mr. Vance said that they needed more tools than they now have to stem the tide of problems cropping up with virtual currencies as they have become more popular. ""Whatever weaknesses they have must be addressed much more seriously,"" Mr. Zabel said. Mr. Lawsky has indicated that Bitcoin is becoming popular enough that regulators need to create regulations that can encourage its growth but limit illegal activity. The price of an individual Bitcoin has risen more than 5,000 percent over the last year, but there has also been a growing list of serious crimes committed in the Bitcoin network, which government officials have struggled to clamp down on.   For their part, Bitcoin advocates have said that virtual currencies are no more prone to crime than credit cards or cash. One of the most popular arguments put forward is that transactions done by criminals using Bitcoin are easy for law enforcement to trace because of the public ledger where transactions are recorded. Earlier this week, Mr. Zabel's office unsealed a complaint against two men accused of helping exchange Bitcoins for people interested in making drug purchases. On Tuesday, during the first day of the hearings, Tyler Winklevoss, a Bitcoin investor with his twin brother, Cameron, said that ""Bitcoin is a terrible place for criminals to conduct criminal activity"" because of the public ledger.  But Mr. Zabel said that while it might be possible to find the computer that a particular Bitcoin purchase came from, digital money users have countless ways to cover their tracks that are not available to people going through traditional banks. Mr. Zabel was involved in the team that tracked down Ross Ulbricht, whom the authorities contend is the owner of the Silk Road online market, where drugs and pornography were available. Mr. Ulbricht used a so-called Tor network to obscure himself, the authorities said, and Mr. Zabel said it was only after overcoming ""substantial hurdles"" that his office found Mr. Ulbricht. Another argument put forward by virtual currency advocates is that cash is actually more attractive to criminals than new forms of digital money, because cash can be moved without any digital trace. Mr. Zabel struck back at that idea by pointing to the difficulty of moving large amounts of cash around the globe.  ""Although cash is also an anonymous form of currency, there are significant barriers to transferring bulk cash out of the banking system,"" he said.  The people representing the Bitcoin industry at the hearings pushed back against any strenuous new regulations on virtual currency companies. But at another panel on Wednesday, top executives of two of the most prominent Bitcoin companies said they were hoping that Mr. Lawsky does provide more regulatory clarity so that everyone will feel more comfortable using digital money. ""Regulation could be a good thing,"" said Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of Coinbase, the largest middleman for Bitcoin transactions.  Regulators around the world have been grappling with the appropriate way to treat Bitcoin, coming up with very different approaches. The Chinese government recently made many types of virtual currency transactions illegal. The hearings in New York drew a global audience. Mr. Lawsky said that viewers from 108 different countries tuned in to the webcast his office set up.  "
More Bitcoin Regulation Is Inevitable,"The next phase in the development of virtual currencies like Bitcoin was highlighted at a hearing last week conducted by Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State's top banking regulator. The question is not whether there will be greater regulation of firms developing new methods of transmitting payments with nongovernment currencies, but how much regulation they will face. The idea that Bitcoin could be an alternative to traditional money that would allow users to conduct transactions anonymously beyond the pale of intrusive government regulators has proved to be little more than a pipe dream. In testimony at last week's hearing, Barry E. Silbert, the founder of Bitcoin Investment Trust, acknowledged that ""it may be appropriate to regulate any transaction that involves an unregulated intermediary converting Bitcoin to dollars on behalf of a third party.""  As if to make the message especially clear that the government is keeping a close eye, the Justice Department unsealed a criminal complaint the day before the hearings charging two men with using a Bitcoin exchange to help pay for illegal narcotics transactions. One defendant, Charlie Schrem, was on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, which is promoting the virtual currency as a new means for conducting business around the world.  Federal regulators have already been going after companies that allow payments in virtual currencies. In March 2013, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a part of the Treasury Department known as FinCen, issued guidance stating that anyone operating an exchange for virtual currencies would be considered to be running a money transmitting business.   That designation means exchanges must collect information about customers, as required under Bank Secrecy Act regulations, which are intended to prevent transactions through anonymous accounts. FinCen went a step further in its guidance by including any person who puts into circulation a virtual currency, which means that the so-called Bitcoin miners are also subject to the regulations. The only ones not subject to the Bank Secrecy Act are users of virtual currencies who only buy and sell goods and services. FinCen exempted their transactions, which means individuals and merchants who use Bitcoin like cash do not need to comply with the regulations imposed on those operating exchanges. If that were the extent of government regulation, there would be little concern about the negative effect of new rules on the development of virtual currencies. No one supports creating an anonymous bazaar for dealing in drugs and other illegal goods and services - except, perhaps, the criminals themselves. The more difficult issue is whether the government will reach further and try to impose more onerous rules on the exchanges and users of virtual currencies. It might be helpful to consider what underpins any form of currency. Putting it simply, there are two aspects to currency: the medium by which it is exchanged, and the promise it incorporates. The medium can be almost anything, from paper notes and coins to gold and silver to electronic credits stored in a financial institution or central bank account. When a government issues currency, it comes with the promise that it is a legitimate means of transacting business in that country. A dollar bill, for instance, states that it is ""legal tender for all debts, public and private.""  But virtual currencies raise concerns about how they can be transmitted and used for illegal purposes. Testimony before Mr. Lawsky by Richard B. Zabel, the deputy United States attorney in Manhattan, highlighted the challenge facing law enforcement with the ""ease of movement"" that a medium like Bitcoin can provide.   Transferring $1 million in cash to buy drugs in another country would be difficult because of the sheer bulk of that much money and would probably get the attention of banking officials. Using the equivalent in Bitcoin, however, only involves a few keystrokes. So a virtual currency would be much more attractive than cash to those engaging in global illegal transactions. The regulations in place for virtual currency exchanges may not be enough to satisfy law enforcement's desire to keep criminals from creating a new avenue for transferring value across borders. If someone was able to gather up enough Bitcoin while avoiding scrutiny from virtual currency exchanges, then the transactions could fly beneath the regulatory reporting rules. Regulators are also concerned that exchanges based in foreign countries might not impose the same customer disclosure requirements as the United States. If someone can use a foreign exchange to conduct business outside the American government's watchful gaze, then criminals could find ways to slip between the cracks and avoid scrutiny.  Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, testified that ""we need stronger tools to combat new emerging threats derived from these payment systems.""   It would not be a surprise if one tool would require those who control or trade over a certain threshold amount of a virtual currency to report their holdings to the government. This approach is much like the rules requiring the owner of 5 percent of the shares of a publicly traded company to disclose any transactions to the Securities and Exchange Commission. One promise supporting government currencies is that they have a certain value. A central bank work tirelessly to maintain a target level for its currency in relation to other currencies, which explains why the fear of inflation is so great. Virtual currencies do not carry the same promise. So they depend on the market to determine their value, which is often stated in relation to a traditional currency, like the dollar or euro. The government has no stake in how Bitcoin is valued, but it is concerned that consumers be protected from abuses when they use a virtual currency to pay for goods and services. Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly in value, highlighted by a chart from Coinbase showing that it increased over 400 percent in November and then lost nearly half its value in December. That type of volatility is an invitation to unscrupulous dealers and merchants to overcharge or underpay. To protect consumers who want to use Bitcoin for legitimate transactions, the government may adopt reporting requirements on virtual currency exchanges so that there is a public repository of information about prices. Although the government cannot control the value of a virtual currency, it can make the currency more transparent to users so that they are not defrauded.   Much as the S.E.C. and Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulate stock and futures exchanges, government regulators may require centralizing the trading in virtual currencies so that the market is less susceptible to manipulation. That is a short step from treating firms that trade in virtual currencies like stock and commodities brokers, which are subject to extensive disclosure and capital requirements. The days of anonymous transactions in Bitcoin and operating an exchange with no outside interference are over. As virtual currencies develop, firms devoted to aiding trading, and perhaps even their users, will encounter greater government regulation, along with the costs that come with compliance.   "
Apple Takes Down a Bitcoin App,"Apple has taken down one of the last remaining iPhone mobile applications that allowed users to buy and sell Bitcoin.  The app, named BlockChain, had been downloaded 120,000 times, and was commonly used as a way to send and receive Bitcoins. BlockChain's chief executive, Nicolas Cary, claimed on Wednesday that Apple had made the move as a pre-emptive effort to protect the mobile payment systems Apple is developing. ""It's well known that Apple is developing its own payment system,"" he said. ""They are building a walled garden to interfere with innovation."" Apple declined to comment. Other Bitcoin apps have previously come and gone from the Apple App Store. BlockChain received an email from Apple on Wednesday evening explaining that the app ""has been removed from the App Store due to an unresolved issue."" Mr. Cary said that Apple had not contacted it previously about any issues with the app, and that the app was essentially unchanged since Apple approved it for the store two years ago. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Apple was stepping up its efforts to create proprietary systems that will make it possible to make payments with an iPhone.  "
Bitcoin Exchange Struggles,"A major player in the Bitcoin universe was struggling to stay alive on Monday, raising questions about whether there is a fundamental flaw in the computer program that underlies the virtual currency.  The price of Bitcoin has fallen sharply, to below $600 for a single Bitcoin from over $800 a week ago. Mt. Gox, a Japanese company that was previously the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, halted all customer withdrawals late last week. On Monday, the company said its problems were caused by a previously undetected glitch in the basic Bitcoin protocol that makes it possible for users to fake transactions. Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, disputed Mt. Gox's account and said the problem was at the Japaneseexchange. ""The issues that Mt. Gox has been experiencing are due to an unfortunate interaction between Mt. Gox's highly customized wallet software, their customer support procedures, and an obscure (but long-known) quirk in the way transactions are identified and not due to a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol,"" Mr. Andresen said in a statement. The price of Bitcoin recovered a bit on Monday morning, rising to nearly $650. Mt. Gox has been struggling for months to process transactions, leading many customers to take their business to other exchanges that have vaulted past Mt. Gox in popularity. But Mt. Gox's claims were taken so seriously because if they are true they raise basic questions about the soundness of the Bitcoin experiment, which has swept the technology and finance world over the last year taking the price of a single coin up over 3000 percent. From its creation in 2009, one of the most important and vaunted features of the Bitcoin program was its ability to prevent the same coins from being moved to two different places at the same time. In its announcement on Monday, Mt. Gox said that a  bug in the Bitcoin software makes it possible for someone to use the Bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it seem like a sending of Bitcoins to a Bitcoin wallet did not occur when in fact it did occur."" The company said: ""We have discussed this solution with the Bitcoin core developers and will allow Bitcoin withdrawals again once it has been approved and standardized."" Other exchanges did not report similar problems, but none of the biggest companies immediately put out a response. Beyond Mt. Gox, Bitcoin users have been rattled by several setbacks in recent days. On Friday, the Russian government said Bitcoin transactions were illegal. They joined the Chinese government, which said in December that financial institutions in the country could not participate in Bitcoin transactions. Florida prosecutors, meanwhile, arrested people on Friday who had met to exchange Bitcoins for dollars, the first such arrests. American authorities have generally given a tentative blessing to the Bitcoin experiment. But they have warned consumers about the dangers  and the fatal problems that could still pop up.  "
Before a Bitcoin Fund Comes a Price Index,"Stock traders have the S.&P. 500. Bitcoin bettors will have the Winkdex. The new financial index takes its name from the Winklevoss brothers, famous for their legal battle with the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The Winkdex was released publicly on Wednesday and provides a regularly updated figure for the price of Bitcoin, the virtual currency that has risen in popularity over the last year. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss announced the creation of the Winkdex in a regulatory filing they made on Wednesday afternoon to the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund they first applied to create last summer.  The new filing shows that the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is moving closer to regulatory approval despite skepticism in some investor circles. The brothers are now hoping to start the fund later this year, making it the first Bitcoin E.T.F. ""We've been very encouraged with how responsive and deferential the S.E.C. has been to the application,"" Cameron Winklevoss said.   The brothers and their company, Math-Based Asset Services, are being represented by lawyers at Katten Muchin Rosenman who have helped shepherd some of the most popular E.T.F.'s through the regulatory process. The Winkelvoss Bitcoin Trust is set to be traded on public stock exchanges. The fund will work with other financial firms to buy and sell Bitcoin each day to remain in line with the number of outstanding shares of the E.T.F. The so-called net asset value of the fund will be adjusted at the close of trading each day, based on the value of the Winkdex. The brothers first filed for the trust last July, soon after publicly disclosing their own sizable holdings in Bitcoin. The brothers have also invested in several virtual currency start-ups. Their investments recently came under scrutiny after the founder of a company in which they invested, BitInstant, was arrested and charged with money laundering. The brothers said they were passive investors in the company. The E.T.F. aims to provide an easy way for ordinary investors to bet on the future price movement of Bitcoin, which has gone through several volatile swings. Investors, though, will pay for the work that the Winklevoss's company will do in maintaining and securing the Bitcoins held by the E.T.F. The size of the management fees have not yet been specified.    There is already one investment fund, the Bitcoin Investment Trust, that allows Americans to bet on movements in Bitcoin's price. That currently has $50.4 million under management, but it is available only to wealthier, accredited investors, and is not publicly traded. The new Winkdex will put the brothers in competition with a growing number of companies providing data on the virtual currency industry. The most popular index for the price of a Bitcoin is operated by Coindesk, a news and information website. Coindesk's Bitoin Price Index is compiled using prices from two different virtual currency exchanges. Until last week it also used the price from a third, Mt. Gox, but that was removed from the index after the exchange suspended customer withdrawals. The Winkdex will use data from seven different exchanges and weight the prices based on the volume of trading on each exchange.  Early Wednesday afternoon, the Winkdex stood at $627, up 0.7 percent from a day earlier. A number of exchanges encountered difficulty last week after Mt. Gox exposed a problem in some of the basic Bitcoin computer code. The regulatory filing on Wednesday added a discussion of that problem. The filing also discusses the many governments that have made pronouncements about the legality of Bitcoin since the last revision to the application in October.  "
Facebook Stock Not So Different Than Bitcoin,"With its extraordinary swoop on WhatsApp last week, Facebook proved its stock is not so different from the crypto-currency of the moment, Bitcoin. They can both be used for certain, specific purposes. Neither is backed by a government. Both depend on vast networks of individuals. And their worth reflects demand, which is based on murky fundamentals. The trick: monetize them while they still have value. Unlike U.S. dollars, neither Facebook shares nor Bitcoins are an official form of legal tender. But some people are willing to accept them as payment. A prominent example is WhatsApp's founders and financial backers, who happily exchanged their stakes in the text-messaging startup for Facebook stock worth $15 billion. Yet Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's boss, would have struggled to purchase a coffee with his shares at the German bakery where he and WhatsApp Chief Executive Jan Koum appear to have hatched the deal.  Similarly, Bitcoin enjoys no universal acceptance. True, at Bandana's Bar-B-Q in Coralville, Iowa the currency will buy a slab of ribs. But it will not get a Big Mac at any of McDonald's 14,000 outlets in the United States. Bitcoin is not money as most people understand it. There is no Treasury Department controlling its issuance or value. It is backed only by mathematics, and its total stock is limited at 21 million virtual coins. In that sense, Bitcoin is only as useful as the network of people and businesses that are willing to accept it in exchange for goods and services. It goes without saying that a similar ""network effect"" underpins Facebook's entire existence. There is one big difference. Unlike Bitcoin, Facebook's share count can expand. Last week, it issued 182 million new shares and 46 million restricted stock units to WhatsApp's owners, adding some 9 percent to the total of shares outstanding. Such share-printing could undermine the share's value, just as governments debase their currencies by printing too much money. Of course, Facebook does something - it's not merely a putative store of value like Bitcoin. So it can grow into its larger equity base. The risk for Facebook and Bitcoin, respectively, is that someone creates a better social network or decentralized digital currency. History suggests both will happen - innovators almost never retain their dominant positions ad infinitum. Indeed, there are signs this may already be occurring. So far, Facebook shareholders are happy with their dilution. The stock price rose on the purchase of an upstart with no financial track record on which to judge its future success within Facebook. However, the acquisition makes Mr. Zuckerberg look fearful. Although Facebook's business is robust today, it seems that it must make big, near-blind wagers on the next big thing, lest it lose its edge. The fundamental value of Bitcoin is incredibly tricky to pin down. According to The MIT Technology Review, Bitcoin was four times more volatile in 2013 than the average stock, and the dollar-Bitcoin exchange rate was 10 times more volatile than the dollar rate with major currencies like the euro or yen. What's not hard to recognize: Bitcoin's worth has nearly halved since the beginning of December. Whatever the similarities, or differences, between the pseudo-currencies of Facebook shares and Bitcoins are, their values are clearly not fixed. Next to selling them, the wisest course of action would be to capitalize on their value. Mr. Zuckerberg just did that with Facebook stock in the WhatsApp deal.

Japan Studies Regulation of Bitcoin After Mt. Gox Goes Dark,"TOKYO- A top government official said Wednesday that Japan was studying possible ways to regulate Bitcoin trading  in the wake of the implosion of a prominent Tokyo-based trading platform for the virtual currency. Japan has no laws regulating the use of Bitcoins, and authorities here have seemed content to take a wait-and-see attitude on the currency and its recent ups and downs. But on Wednesday, Yoshihide Suga, a top government spokesman, said that relevant authorities - including Japan's Financial Services Agency, Finance Ministry, and the police - were collecting information on the Bitcoin trade in Japan, with an eye on regulatory action.  ''Once we assess the situation, we will respond as necessary,'' Mr. Suga told a press conference. ''At the moment, we are still in the information-gathering stage.''  Japan's new interest in Bitcoin comes as authorities around the world grapple with regulating, or even defining, a virtual currency whose trade has surged in recent years. Japanese financial regulators had so far suggested that the virtual coins are a traded product, not a currency, and therefore remain outside their purview. Some in Japan, where Bitcoin adoption has been relatively slow, continue to question whether the currency is here to stay, or a mere fad. Koji Ishida, a member of the Bank of Japan's policy board, said that the bank saw limited use and adoption of Bitcoins. Instead, the central bank should focus on ensuring smooth fiat money transactions for now, Mr. Ishida told reporters outside Tokyo, according to the Nikkei website. ''Though some people might find it useful, its use is limited as a method of transaction,'' Mr. Ishida said. The central bank would leave it up to the government to mull any regulatory steps, he said. Users of the now seemingly defunct Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange have said they would seek to meet with Japanese financial regulators to urge them to act against the secretive platform and help those seeking redress. Mt. Gox went dark on Tuesday amid rumors that hackers had swiped millions of dollars' worth of the virtual currency from its systems. In a statement on the company's website on Wednesday, Mt. Gox's chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said he was still in Japan and ''working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues.'' Mr. Karpeles also said that Mt. Gox employees had been instructed not to give out any information, and asked users to refrain from asking the staff questions.  Kolin Burges, a trader from London who flew to Japan this month after the exchange stopped paying out funds, said he was considering legal action to try to retrieve the money he invested in the exchange last month. But he conceded that there would not be much point in suing if the company itself had lost all of its funds. Like their counterparts elsewhere, Japanese authorities head into unfamiliar territory in regulating a virtual currency. A relatively easy change for regulation would be to bring Bitcoins under the purview of Japan's Payment Services Act, which oversees electronic money, shopping points and escrow transactions, according to a person with knowledge of the Financial Services Agency's thinking. Such a move could enforce new limits on Bitcoin transactions, including transaction size. While Bitcoin has faced relatively little scrutiny here, it has invited comparisons to an infamous scandal involving ''Enten,'' an electronic currency used by a Tokyo company to defraud investors of billions of yen in the mid-2000s.  Some experts say that because of the sway physical cash still holds in Japan, with many businesses still refusing to accept credit cards and trusting only cash, Bitcoin adoption will be slow, reducing the need for regulators to move quickly. ''There just hasn't been the need for Bitcoin in Japan as there's been elsewhere,'' said James MacWhyte, an early Bitcoin user and long-term Tokyo resident who is working to set up an association of Bitcoin users in Japan. He said the low adoption reflected the trust Japanese still seemed to hold in government institutions and government-issued money. ''No one has lost their pensions, the government hasn't shut down, bank fees are reasonable, and electronic money is so fast and easy to use,'' Mr. MacWhyte said. ''But that could change,'' he said. The general attitude among Japanese experts seems to be to let Bitcoin users be - but that anyone dabbling in virtual currencies should be aware of the risks. ''Its use should be left to those who find it's useful,'' Koji Sakuma, an economist at the Institute of Monetary Affairs, said in a research note earlier this month. ''Those who buy it might incur losses as prices go wildly up and down,'' Mr. Sakuma said, ''but I don't see it as a problem for those who choose not to get involved.''

Fortress Discloses a Paper Loss on Bitcoin,"The Fortress Investment Group has reported a paper loss of $3.7 million from investments in Bitcoin, the first large public company to disclose a stake in the volatile virtual currency.  Fortress said it bought $20 million worth of Bitcoin in 2013, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. As of Dec. 31, that stake was worth less than $17 million. Executives at Fortress have expressed interest in Bitcoin for months, but it has been unclear just how the company might be involved with it. Ripple Labs, a budding online Bitcoin payment system, has previously disclosed investment from Pantera Capital, which includes money from executives at Fortress. The Fortress filing did not detail the exact nature of its virtual currency investment in its filing on Thursday, and a spokesman for Fortress could not be immediately reached for comment. Bitcoin, which exists only as computer code, has thus far circumvented the traditional financial system. That has posed a challenge for regulators, which now face increased pressure in the wake of the collapse of Mt. Gox, one of the earliest and at one point largest Bitcoin exchanges. Fortress's investment in Bitcoin represents a tiny fraction of the firm's nearly $70 billion under management. But its stake could encourage interest in an industry that has not yet gained a foothold with Wall Street or the general economy. ""This makes it more legitimate for the hedge funds to buy, and easier, and provide the path for any other public company to report it,"" said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities.  ""Now there's a bleuprint for how to go through reporting ownership of Bitcoin in a public S.E.C. filing."" Banks have largely shied away from Bitcoin because of its volatility and lack of regulation. That has fueled Bitcoin's instability, and the price has fluctuated wildly since the currency was introduced in 2009. But venture capital firms and other established entrepreneurs have begun to back new Bitcoin companies with more sophisticated infrastructure and technology. That's fueled some hopes that Bitcoin could gain more of a foothold in the mainstream. ""I think the question now is whether they're going to market this as a product to their investors,"" Mr. Luria said of Fortress's investment. ""I think that would be the next step I would expect from them."" "
Britain to Drops Plan to Tax Trading of Bitcoins,"LONDON - British tax authorities said Monday that they would not impose a tax on trading of the virtual currency Bitcoin. The announcement comes just days after Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo.  HM Revenue & Customs, the British tax agency, said on Monday that it wouldn't charge a 20 percent tax, known as a value added tax, or VAT, on trades of the virtual currency. But, taxes still must be collected on any purchases made using Bitcoin, the tax agency said. ""In all instances, VAT will be due in the normal way from suppliers of any goods or services sold in exchange for Bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrency,"" the tax agency said.  VAT is charged on most business transactions in Britain and Europe whether they are between businesses or companies selling to the public. VAT is similar to sales tax in the United States and is included in the price for products and services sold to the public, such as clothing or other merchandise. Last year, Britain said it considered Bitcoin a tradeable voucher and that VAT could be charged on the value of the currency. Entrepreneurs in Britain had argued that treatment put them at a disadvantage to other countries. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies ""have a unique identity and cannot therefore be directly compared to any other form of investment activity or payment mechanism,"" the tax agency said on Monday. In December, China banned the nation's banks from accepting Bitcoins as a currency over concerns about potential money laundering and its potential threat to financial stability.  The European Banking Authority also has warned consumers about the potential risks of using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, including losing money if a Bitcoin exchange, such as Mt. Gox, collapses.  "
Bitcoin Is a Protocol. Bitcoin Is a Brand.,"So it appears the creator of Bitcoin wasn't a young Japanese mathematical wizard as had been long rumored. Instead, as Newsweek has first reported, he is believed to be a 64-year-old Japanese-American man named Satoshi Nakamoto who clearly does not care for attention. But Mr. Nakamoto's work has spread across the globe, even if there is still wide confusion about what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin, an Internet-based cryptocurrency, has been in the news for months, of course. Conceptions of what Bitcoin actually is, however, still run from money to software to a network of diehard believers. The Bitcoin-like currencies like Auroracoin, Dogecoin or Unobtanium offer another perspective: More than anything, Bitcoin is a brand. On one level, Bitcoin is an open-source software protocol for creating an encrypted ""currency,"" against which people store value. That is partly to give users peace of mind, since it can be inspected for security or flaws and upgraded by its own users. Open-source code can also be copied and reconfigured, cheaply enough that you might consider making a coin for your sweetheart. ""It takes about 20 minutes, and costs about $50,"" said Brock Pierce, a Bitcoin entrepreneur and investor. ""I've seen 275 logos of different coins. There's probably thousands."" He was speaking at the Oasis conference in Los Angeles, where a crowd of traditional investors seemed generally warm to the new currencies. There is not a lot of financial risk here. The website Coinmarketcap keeps tabs on the 100 most valuable. The biggest is Bitcoin, with a total market capitalization of about $8.3 billion, or 70 percent of the $11.1 billion in total market cap of all 100 coins.  Ripple, the second largest (and a trading system not based on Bitcoin) is at $1.5 billion. The recent No. 100 on the list, Pandacoin, had a market cap of $88,537, or about twice what Arby's paid for the hat that the singer Pharrell Williams wore at the Grammy awards in January. It should be noted that the recent fall of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange, with losses of about $460 million, had much more to do with the lack of oversight at the exchange, and not with Bitcoin as a protocol.  Eric E. Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, is one believer in the integrity of the Bitcoin software. ""I had a look at the code,"" he said. ""It's very good. Very sound."" Several of the new ""-coins"" themselves are gimmicky. Auroracoin promises to give coins to every citizen of Iceland, and recently had the fourth-largest market cap, at $367 million. Dogecoin is named for the lovable Internet meme. Unobtanium is named after the preposterous anti-gravitational mineral in the movie ""Avatar.""  It pains some Bitcoin fans. ""Early on, I thought, 'Oh God - fragmentation,'"" Mr. Pierce said. ""It's inevitable."" Now he's decided that it's a good thing. Lots of people are trying out different styles of money, until the world finds one it loves. Which shows how Bitcoin's fate is tied to its brand: The network of users is also a network of believers, who are moved to use one of these protocols over another as a currency. And if the brand falters, Bitcoin will be sold off. To that end, Bitcoin's fast recovery from the Mt. Gox collapse is a positive for the brand. It could be argued that paper money is a country's brand, as well, except traditional money comes with hard rules and enforced regulations that tend to overpower emotional claims. Dogecoin, which became big in part because that doggie is just so cute, cannot quite make the same claim. In open-source software, continuous tweaks to existing code, to the point of making the end product altogether different, is known as ""forking."" It is considered bad, since it makes it hard to build a standard.  The continual churn of currencies, and the promiscuous use of the protocol, make some people suspicious of how well Bitcoin and its kin will endure.  ""I used to do security for a lot of three-letter agencies, and I don't think Bitcoin has really been through a thorough security check,"" said Alex Payne, co-founder and former chief technical officer of Simple, an online bank that last month was sold to BBVA for $117 million. ""A cryptocurrency that the world uses for the next 50 years will have to get audits from regulators, universities, places the entrepreneurs of these currencies like to ridicule,"" he added.  "
Japan Won't Impose Banking Laws on Bitcoins,"TOKYO - Bitcoin trading platforms like the now-defunct Mt. Gox exchange can, for now, operate freely under Japanese law, the government said Friday in a note that signaled a hands-off approach to the virtual currency. In fact, Bitcoins are not a currency at all and are not subject to Japan's stringent banking laws, officials said in a six-page paper that highlighted uncertainties more than clarifying the issues surrounding the digital payment system. The paper did confirm that transactions using Bitcoins are not considered banking and that an exchange trading them does not need to obtain a banking license or to meet compliance standards that such a license would require. But Bitcoins' status also makes them off-limits for Japanese banks, seemingly leaving the handling of them up to unregulated operators like Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy protection last week after losing half a billion dollars' worth of its customers' Bitcoins. Like any other commodity, however, Bitcoins are subject to taxes in Japan, the paper said. It left unclear whether the simple purchase of Bitcoins would be subject to Japan's 5 percent sales tax, which is set to rise to 8 percent in April. Toshinori Matsushio, an official at the National Tax Agency, said that Bitcoin purchases were likely to be slapped with the sales tax unless they were singled out for exemption, much as postage stamps are in Japan. It would also be virtually impossible for the government to levy taxes on peer-to-peer sales. In this regard, Japan's regulatory approach seemed to differ from that taken by other countries. According to a statement this week by the UK Digital Currency Association, British revenue and customs officials are set to announce that virtual currencies should be treated almost identically to other currencies in terms of taxation. That would mean no sales tax would be levied on Bitcoin sales and transactions. Still, the paper stressed that discussions would continue on the details of how Bitcoins would be taxed, as well as the need for more regulation to better protect Bitcoin users. Japan ""has not yet grasped a complete picture"" of Bitcoins, the paper said, and various government agencies are still ""collecting information."" Now that Bitcoin has been deemed beyond the limits of Japan's financial regulator, basic oversight and the drafting of more detailed guidelines could be left to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry or the consumer protection agency. In a news conference, the top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said investigations of the Mt. Gox collapse could make it necessary for the government to review or revise its response. When asked to clarify how Bitcoins might be taxed, Mr. Suga chuckled but gave no details. ""Of course, the Finance Ministry would be thinking of various ways to tax it,"" he said. The government prepared its note in response to questions submitted to Parliament by an opposition lawmaker, Tsutomu Okubo, a former managing director for Morgan Stanley. The cabinet approved the paper Friday morning.  Colin Moreshead contributed reporting from Tokyo.   "
Morgan Stanley Chief Calls Bitcoin 'Surreal',"To its devotees, Bitcoin represents the future of transactions. But the financial establishment is still scratching its head over the virtual currency. James P. Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, said in a television interview on Monday that he did not have a firm grasp of Bitcoin, which has been much in the news after the collapse of a major exchange, Mt. Gox, and after Newsweekclaimed to have found the currency's creator.    ""Wow,"" Mr. Gorman said, smiling, when Maria Bartiromo of the Fox Business Network asked him about Bitcoin. ""I'm not sure I understand it."" ""It's totally surreal,"" he said. ""I mean, who's the founder? This guy in L.A.? What's going on with Mt. Gox? There's so many moving parts."" ""I would think and hope that the regulators are paying a lot of attention to it,"" he added. Another bank chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who runs JPMorgan Chase, has also expressed skepticism about Bitcoin, calling it a ""terrible store of value"" that could be ""replicated over and over."" ""The question isn't whether we accept it,"" Mr. Dimon said in a recent interview with CNBC. ""The question is, do we even participate in people who facilitate Bitcoin?"" These pronouncements from big banks' chief executives are significant for the Bitcoin proponents who think that the best hope for the virtual currency is to become integrated into the existing financial system. Raj Date, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who recently joined the board of a start-up focused on Bitcoin, said recently that ""market makers"" could help iron out Bitcoin's volatility. But another strain of Bitcoin fans thinks that the currency can thrive outside of traditional banking, offering a more seamless way to transfer money around the globe. Despite the skepticism from bank chief executives, Bitcoin has found a more welcome reception in the research department of Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, which predicted in a report in December that it could ""become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers.""

"At SXSW Conference, a Mother Presses Her Son's Case","Among the tech start-ups pitching their ideas at SXSW this week, there was a mother, advocating not a new company but the cause of her son. Lyn Ulbricht's son, Ross Ulbricht, was arrested in October and charged with operating the Silk Road, the online drug bazaar where Bitcoin was the only money accepted. Ms. Ulbricht has been raising money to pay for her's son's legal bills, and she thought that the crowd at SXSW would be receptive to Mr. Ulbricht's cause.  By Monday, she looked tired after making appearances at several Bitcoin-related events. At each appearance, she handed out fliers with the website her family set up, FreeRoss.org, and a QR code that allowed donors to give money immediately. ""I see it as my job to pay the people who can help my son,"" she said after the biggest Bitcoin-related panel at SXSW, where she was the first person in line to ask a question and mention her effort to the crowd. She and her husband, who run a business renting houses in Costa Rica, have made her son's cause into a nearly full-time job. She says she is taking a class on Twitter and Facebook to learn how to use social media to promote the effort. She had used neither - and had not possessed a Bitcoin - before her son's arrest. ""It's a whole new world for us,"" she said. When she has a chance to make her pitch, Ms. Ulbricht has not been talking about the merit's of the case. She says she doesn't know more than what is in the public documents. But Mr. Ulbricht has pleaded not guilty and Ms. Ulbricht has said she wants people to know him not as an indicted suspect, but as the ""wonderful person"" she knows. Friends and acquaintances described Mr. Ulbricht in a recent New York Times article as soulful and sensitive. The biggest deterrent to her efforts, she says, is the government allegations that Mr. Ulbricht solicited several murders for hire. Those charges did not end up in his final indictment, and Ms. Ulbricht says she is confident they are not true. ""I kept reading these awful things that don't sound like him at all,"" she said. She has also been arguing that her son's case matters more broadly.  ""This case opens new legal territory and the government is poised to set Internet and financial law with it,"" the website she helped build says. ""Bad law could be ushered in and we will be forced to live with it."" The trip to Austin was a homecoming of sorts for Ms. Ulbricht. She and her husband raised their family in Austin, but they recently moved to New York to be near their son, who is in jail in Brooklyn awaiting trial. Since she began raising money for her son, the donations have not been pouring in. Ms. Ulbricht says that many people have the perception that her family, or her son, was rich from Silk Road, where the operator collected a commission on each purchase. But she said that the family did not have enough to pay for the bills, and whatever Bitcoins that Mr. Ulbricht owned when he was arrested are off limits until the case is over. Ms. Ulbricht said she had not seen a major uptick in donations after attending Texas Bitcoin Conference, which took place last week, and SXSW this week. Only a few people took the fliers she handed out to attendees coming out of the Bitcoin talk on Monday. But she said she had received moral support from enough people, which she said she told her son about when she spoke with him by phone on Monday. ""No one is going to be mean to me,"" she said. ""I am a mom who is in a very bad position. At worst case, they just ignore me. But people have been very kind.""  "
A Turnaround for Bitcoin at SXSW,"AUSTIN, Tex. - At last year's South by Southwest gathering, regarded as the place where are the hip technology companies showed up, Bitcoin was still such an underdog that it was not important enough to command a single event or panel. This year, it is hard to avoid the upstart virtual currency. Bitcoin has been the subject of official events at SXSW's largest venues, and was also the buzz at after-parties that had luminaries from the tech world in attendance.  It was soon after SXSW last year that Bitcoin won an informal stamp of approval from the Treasury Department. That helped send the price of a Bitcoin on a wild ride, starting at around $50 and rising to more than $250, before a quick crash. Since then, it has experienced several run-ups and quick drops. Most recently the price was sent careening after the collapse of the first big Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, which raised questions about the long-term viability of Bitcoin.  Still, the sheer number of events, and the level of interest in virtual currency, at SXSW underscored the degree of fascination that Bitcoin is generating in the mainstream tech sector, and the broad applications that some people are imagining for it.   ""Anyone who has any interest in technology has to be interested in this,"" said Russell Castagnaro, who was attending his second SXSW for his job with the Hawaii Information Consortium. Mr. Castagnaro has attended as many of the Bitcoin events as he has been able to pack in, finishing with a meetup on Tuesday morning of Bitangels, a group that is trying to connect start-ups with angel investors.  Mr. Castagnaro is hoping that governments will begin to use the ledger that is a part of the Bitcoin system to transfer property and make payments easier. There were people from about a dozen different countries at the Bitangels events, and only a few of them were involved with Bitcoin companies. Even at events not specifically about Bitcoin, the topic frequently came up. At a panel discussion on ""The Future of Money,"" hosted by Yahoo, one panelist was from PayPal and the other from BitPay, a company that enables merchants to accept virtual currency payments. The rapper Nas brought it up during a panel discussion that featured the venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, a firm that has invested about $50 million in Bitcoin-related start-ups. Mr. Horowitz said he believed Bitcoin was like ""the Internet of money."" At one of the most exclusive parties at the conference, hosted by Nas and Mr. Horowitz, the two kibitzed with Fred Ehrsam, the chief executive of Coinbase, a Bitcoin company they have both recently invested in. ""Once you get people talking about this, you can't get them to talk about anything else,"" Mr. Ehrsam said. For Bitcoin entrepreneurs, the rise from scrappy outsiders to tech world insiders has been a bit dizzying. A year ago, Coinbase, for instance, was barely up and running and consisted of just Mr. Ehrsam and a partner. This year, his first time at SXSW, Mr. Ehrsam was invited to be the main speaker at a session on Monday afternoon in one of the conference's largest venues, which drew a large crowd.   Mr. Ehrsam's event, and many others, have frequently had to address the scandals that have plagued the virtual currency, including the downfall of Mt. Gox, and the frequent use of it for illegal means. At the Bitangels meeting, a man from Spain said, ""I am really skeptical about Bitcoin, but I'm willing to learn,"" while an entrepreneur from Los Angeles said he was concerned ""about the snake oil aspects of it."" Mr. Ehrsam, like many other Bitcoin backers, argued that Mt. Gox was a company that used Bitcoin, but it was not important to the underlying decentralized network that Bitcoin runs on. As a result, he said, its collapse should not threaten the basic technology that was invented in 2009 to allow digital money to be moved around the Internet. Many of the Bitcoin start-ups at the conference were pitching services that would make virtual currency accounts more secure with things like multiple-signature capabilities.   Bitcoin fans are hoping that the events at SXSW will help broaden the acceptance of virtual currencies beyond the early adopters and speculators who have driven many of the price moves until now. But these fans are also imagining such rapid growth for the currency that they think a year from now, Bitcoin may be helping SXSW rather than the other way around. ""Bitcoin could help SXSW continue to evolve as some of the other trends drop away,"" said Michael Terpin, the founder of Bitangels.  "
Will the Real Satoshi Nakamoto Please Stand Up?,"TOKYO - Satoshi Nakamoto of Fujisawa, Japan, is a shoe repairman.  Satoshi Nakamoto of Hiroshima is preparing to open a men's clothing store. And Satoshi Nakamoto in Tokyo is a Primal Scream-loving former worker at a rental music studio, according to the studio's Twitter feed. There are at least 28 other Satoshi Nakamotos with listed phone numbers in Japan, and even more on Facebook. Like Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, the California man profiled in a recent Newsweek article, they all deny creating Bitcoin, the virtual currency.  The identity of the math genius credited as the architect of Bitcoin has been a long-running curiosity among Bitcoin believers and the public at large ever since the online currency was created. But since the Newsweek article emerged, there has been a renewed interest in pinning down the ""real"" Satoshi Nakamoto. And although it has been widely suggested that the name may just be a pseudonym for a person or group of people, those who are named such have been enjoying a lot of attention. ""It's not me. I only heard of Bitcoin a few months ago, and it sounds risky,"" Satoshi Nakamoto said from his ""Leather Clinic"" shoe-and-bag repair shop in Fujisawa, just south of Tokyo. ""I was amused to hear we had the same name, but I prefer real money to virtual money,"" said Satoshi Nakamoto of  Hiroshima, who recently moved to Tokyo to open ""Decollo,"" a clothing store for fashion-conscious ""salarymen"" in Tokyo. Newsweek called the name Satoshi Nakamoto ""distinctive."" But if the magazine's investigation had extended to Japan, where that name originates, it would have found that neither of those names are, in fact, distinctive. About 50,000 people share the Nakamoto family name in Japan, written here using at least five different combinations of characters, according to Hiroshi Morioka, an expert on the study of Japanese surnames. In its most common rendering - using the characters for ""middle"" and ""main,"" - Nakamoto is Japan's 487th most common family name out of over 100,000 known surnames here, he said. ""In general, he said, any name in the top 500 is considered a major name,"" Mr. Morioka said in an email. By comparison, the 487th common last name in the United States is Bryan, he said. Satoshi, meanwhile, was among Japan's top most common given names for boys in the 1960s and 1970s, though the moniker's popularity has fallen in recent years, according to an annual survey of given names by Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance. It does not help that the exact rendering in Japanese of the Satoshi Nakamoto of Bitcoin fame remain unknown. A Japanese translation exists of the 2008 paper in which Mr. Nakamoto famously laid out his design of a new digital currency. Prepared by Roger Ver, a Bitcoin angel investor, the Japanese document is signed in Japanese. But the characters used was just guesswork, Mr. Ver said in an email. ""There isn't any evidence that the Bitcoin Satoshi ever wrote anything in Japanese, ever,"" he said. Written in a variety of ways, other Satoshi Nakamotos identified across Japan include an obstetrician, a councilman, a tour bus operator; an official in the Tottori prefecture office, the president of a company that makes food sterilization devices, a marketing consultant, as well as employees of Mitsubishi Electric, JFE Steel, Itochu and Asahi Calpis Beverage. One of the likelier candidates, a researcher in telecommunications engineering at Kobe University, did not return a request for comment. Of course, there is the issue of English language ability. Most Satoshi Nakamotos here were are unlikely to be able to write in the lucid English that characterize the Bitcoin founder's known writing style. If the name is indeed a pseudonym, one frequently cited candidate is the mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki, of Kyoto University. The professor shot to Bitcoin fame last year after Ted Nelson, the American technologist, singled him out as a figure who seemed to fit the known traits of the Bitcoin creator: genius, reclusiveness and English ability. Mr. Mochizuki, has so far declined to give any statement to the media. A research assistant said that he ""absolutely refused to comment.""  "
"In Hong Kong, Betting Big on Bitcoin"," HONG KONG - By day, David Shin is an investment banker at a major financial firm. By night and in pretty much every other free minute, he is an entrepreneur looking to break into Hong Kong's growing Bitcoin scene. Even as concerns swirl about the long-term viability of the virtual currency, Mr. Shin is raising money, courting clients and hiring staff to build a sort of stock exchange for Bitcoin-oriented companies. Mr. Shin, 38, plans to start his venture, CryptoMex, at the end of April. ""I believe Bitcoin will bring about a brave new world of money,"" he said. ""The Internet started out as a revolutionary protocol, became more easy to use over time, and saw an explosive growth rate. The same is happening with Bitcoin."" Mr. Shin joins a growing field of technology experts, financial players and crypto-geeks who are betting that an unfavorable regulatory environment in mainland China has put this special administrative region - with its more laissez-faire attitude - on the edge of something big.  Bitcoins, digital money backed by no government and ""mined"" by computers performing complex algorithms, have been largely unregulated, creating a virtual Wild West of programmers and speculators. But as Bitcoin tries to gain greater mainstream acceptance, authorities around the world have begun eyeing it more cautiously, as they might a currency. The spectacular collapse of Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange, has only fanned regulators' concerns. The regulatory moves in China have been among the more aggressive to date. In December, the Chinese authorities curtailed the use of Bitcoin by banks and payment processors, which helped halve the value of the virtual currency in two weeks. While the government said the general public was free to trade Bitcoin online, the broad fear is that China may eventually impose a sweeping ban on its use offline, as it did in 2009 to Q Coin, a virtual currency issued by Tencent. But Hong Kong has so far remained relatively passive on the regulatory front. The former British colony has retained a separate political and economic system since it returned to Chinese rule, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's de facto central bank, says it is not directly regulating Bitcoin, at least for now. Entrepreneurs in Hong Kong are essentially playing regulatory arbitrage. Although firm data is scarce, China is widely seen as the world's second-largest market for Bitcoin, after the United States, and the restrictions have cooled its nascent Bitcoin scene. By virtue of proximity, businesses in Hong Kong are hoping to capture some of the demand. ""Like water, Bitcoin may take the path of least resistance and find its way into Hong Kong,"" said Michael Chau, a business professor at the University of Hong Kong. ""Because of the city's proximity to China - and because it has become part of the country since 1997 - Hong Kong has the potential to absorb part of China's Bitcoin market."" The Chinese customer base of Laser Yuan, the founder of the Hong Kong-based exchange BitCashOut, doubled after the December notice. Three weeks ago, ANX, Hong Kong's largest Bitcoin exchange, opened what it said was the world's first brick-and-mortar store for the virtual currency, where customers can buy Bitcoin over the counter. It also set up a Bitcoin vending machine last week. Robocoin, a maker of Bitcoin automated teller machines, will set up its first A.T.M. in Hong Kong this spring, and plans 100 more around the world, none in China, said the company's chief executive, Jordan Kelley. ""We have hundreds and hundreds of Chinese businessmen and entrepreneurs contact us with the purpose of becoming Robocoin operators,"" Mr. Kelley said, adding that if China gave him the green light, the company would ""have 200 A.T.M.s in China before the end of the year, if not more."" Mr. Shin said he first saw the promise of Bitcoin last year, when the coins were worth $25 apiece, compared with about $620 now. After raising $2.5 million, he and his business partners built IceDrill, an operation in Montreal where racks of speedy computers race to generate Bitcoin. But he is now selling part of his stake in the Canadian mine and focusing on his start-up in Hong Kong, which he said could be ""the capital of Bitcoin in Asia."" Mr. Shin recently hired Jake Smith, a well-connected Bitcoin enthusiast who worked for Li Xiaolai - a Chinese investor who reportedly holds 100,000 coins - to get Chinese to buy into the companies listed on his platform. ""When the government comes out and puts constraints on Bitcoin in China, investors naturally look at Hong Kong - not Singapore, not Korea - for substitution,"" said Mr. Shin. Hong Kong operates in a type of regulatory limbo, so uncertainty reigns as much as opportunity. If China clamps down further, Hong Kong may be forced to rethink its stance. John Greenwood, chief economist at Invesco and architect of Hong Kong's exchange-rate system, said that whether the Chinese authorities would toughen measures depended on whether Bitcoin became so prevalent that it undermined China's capital controls. ""China's mainland residents can buy things with Bitcoin from Europe or North America or anywhere else in the world, or make transfers,"" Mr. Greenwood said. ""It's a hole in the dike, a leakage from China's system of foreign-exchange control."" Entrepreneurs like Mr. Shin also face a legacy of past ventures that have proved problematic. Two once-prominent Bitcoin crowdfunding platforms, BTCST and Bitfunder, are now defunct. BTCST, which offered Bitcoin-denominated securities that claimed to return up to 7 percent a week, has been charged by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission with fraud and with running a Ponzi scheme. ""The operating environment is much clearer,"" said Mr. Shin. ""The Hong Kong government has acknowledged Bitcoin as a commodity, so we have clarity on both fronts here as well."" Then there is the need for better basic infrastructure and consumer awareness, a challenge for Bitcoin around the world. For example, few businesses let customers make payments with the currency. In Hong Kong, they largely amount to a boutique hotel, a flower shop, a tailor, a music teacher and a Beijing-style crepe restaurant. On the eve of the Chinese New Year in January, the three co-founders of the Bitcoin exchange ANX took to the bustling streets of the Lan Kwai Fong entertainment district to hand out 50,000 red envelopes, each carrying a little more than a dollar's worth of Bitcoin. ""I use Bitcoin to buy stuff online all the time,"" Ben Lau, an online marketer, said as he stood on the sidewalk using his smartphone to scan the QR code - an image that works like a bar code - on the voucher he had just received. But Mr. Lau was in the minority. Even months after Bitcoin leapt into the limelight, most passers-by had little idea about what it does, and some associated it with drugs and scams. When the after-work crowd diminished, the co-founders went to a nearby bar to check on rumors that it had recently started accepting Bitcoin. A few beers later, Ken Lo, managing director of ANX, waved for the bill and asked to pay in the virtual currency. ""A customer's friend thought our bar had a matching name - Bit Point - with Bitcoin, so he helped us set this up,"" said Gaga Lam, the bar's manager. ""We haven't really tried it out yet."" Her iPad Mini displayed the website of BitPay, the Bitcoin payment processor in which Asian billionaire Li Ka-shing was an early investor. But the group ended up paying with a credit card after a few unsuccessful tries. ""We can do better than that,"" Mr. Lo said, referring to his company's Bitcoin payment solution. ""We clear faster than the banks, our transaction fee is lower than credit card companies, and there would be no chargebacks. And Bitcoin fans will flock to your bar in droves.""  "
Silk Road Case Began With Hunt for a John Doe,"The criminal case against Ross W. Ulbricht, the man who federal prosecutors contend is the mastermind behind the notorious Silk Road online marketplace for illegal drugs and hacked credit card numbers, began quietly with an indictment filed in a Maryland courthouse against an unidentified individual five months before the authorities made an arrest. Last May, federal prosecutors in Maryland indicted a man known only at the time by his Silk Road pseudonym, Dread Pirate Roberts, in a suspected murder-for-hire plot. Prosecutors charged that the Silk Road owner hired an undercover federal agent posing as a seller of drugs on the website to kill an employee.  The ""John Doe"" indictment was sealed by a United States magistrate judge because prosecutors were worried that the operator of the Silk Road website would destroy evidence or flee if he became aware of the pending criminal charges against him. Prosecutors asked the judge to keep the indictment secret until the man known as Dread Pirate Roberts was arrested and no longer at large. That original three-count indictment was unsealed recently by the United States attorney for Maryland, Rod Rosenstein, whose office filed a superseding indictment against Mr. Ulbricht that identified him by name on Oct. 1, the day the F.B.I. arrested him at a library in San Francisco. The court filing fills in some of the gaps in the timeline of the federal government's undercover investigation, which lasted more than a year. F.B.I. agents tracked the computer servers that ran Silk Road's website to locations in Iceland and a small town in eastern Pennsylvania. The unsealed indictment reveals that while federal prosecutors did not know Mr. Ulbricht's identity, they did know the name of the Silk Road employee they say he wanted dead - Curtis Clark Green, who reached a plea bargain with Maryland prosecutors in September and is cooperating with the investigation.  In the court filing, Mr. Curtis, who apparently did not know the identity of his boss, was identified by his initials ""CCG"" and described as a resident of Spanish Fork, Utah.  The unsuccessful murder-for-hire plot is one of the half-dozen criminal charges against Mr. Ulbricht, 29, whom prosecutors in New York have also indicted on charges of money laundering and narcotics trafficking. Mr. Ulbricht, who has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go on trial in November in New York, is being held in custody without bail. Mr. Ulbricht's case has garnered more attention than the average drug-trafficking case, not only because of the sensational nature of the murder-for-hire plot but also because Silk Road accepted only Bitcoin as payment and operated in the hidden corners of the Internet accessible only through a special software system. Mr. Ulbricht's lawyer, Joshua Dratel, has insisted his client is not Dread Pirate Roberts. Some Bitcoin proponents are following Mr. Ulbricht's case closely out of fear that it will taint the digital currency as primarily a vehicle for criminals to engage in illegal activity on the Internet with a high degree of anonymity. Five months after Mr. Ulbricht's arrest, it remains a mystery just how the F.B.I. and other law enforcement officials working on the investigation were able to unmask him as Dread Pirate Roberts, a name taken from ""The Princess Bride,"" a novel a later a movie. What is known is that in May, a few days after Maryland prosecutors indicted Dread Pirate Roberts, agents with the F.B.l. reached out to law enforcement officials in Iceland to try to track down one of Silk Road's servers. Gunnar Runar Sveinbjornsson, an official with the police department in Reykjavik, said in an emailed statement that ""the Icelandic police started assisting the F.B.I. with this matter during middle of May last year."" The federal authorities, in court filings, have not identified the country where the server was found but said the country's authorities gave the F.B.I. an image of its contents in July. Also in July, agents with the Department of Homeland Security visited Mr. Ulbricht at the San Francisco apartment he was in living in at the time after the government intercepted a package addressed to him that contained several fake ID documents that were purchased on Silk Road. The agents questioned him about the items, but he was not arrested. The information on the server in Iceland, meanwhile, would lead authorities to seize information contained on a backup server operated by a company called JTAN.com, which is owned by a staff member in the electrical engineering department at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa. In September, a few weeks before Mr. Ulbricht's arrest, federal authorities served a search warrant on JTAN, seeking access to all of Silk Road's records. The federal authorities said the servers provided a wealth of information about Mr. Ulbricht and the customers of Silk Road, which generated about $1.2 billion in sales during its two-year run and about $80 million in commissions for its owner and his team. Still, the unsealed indictment does not disclose how the F.B.I. managed to find the first server in Iceland used by Silk Road, which employed an encrypted Internet network called Tor to remain hidden from general viewing. Perhaps that part of the story will come out in the next few weeks as prosecutors turn over to Mr. Dratel and Mr. Ulbricht the information they retrieved during the investigation. "
"Mt. Gox Says It Has Found 200,000 Bitcoins Worth About $114 Million","Updated, 8:38 a.m. | Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange that collapsed and filed for bankruptcy last month, said it had found 200,000 Bitcoins that were held in an ""old-format"" wallet, or digital storage file.  Mt. Gox's former chief executive, Mark Karpeles, issued a statement in Japanese and English on the company's website saying that after it filed for bankruptcy, it began researching these wallets that were used before June 2011. That is when the company discovered the 200,000 Bitcoins, which represent about 24 percent of the coins that went missing when the site failed. Last month, Mt. Gox said it had lost 750,000 of its customers' Bitcoin holdings and more than 100,000 of its own coins, or more than $450 million worth. Based on today's rates, the found coins are worth about $114 million. Since then, plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit, seeking a temporary injunction to keep Mr. Karpeles or his company from moving any money outside of the United States. They also want a full accounting of any assets Mt. Gox has left. Mt. Gox said it reported the discovery of the coins to the bankruptcy court on March 10, and that it moved them to an offline site from March 14 to March 15. The latest announcement is likely to add to the questions about Mt. Gox's collapse. Even the company said that it was still uncertain about what led up to its failure. ""Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of Bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation,"" the company concluded in its statement dated Thursday. Bitcoins can be stored online or offline, otherwise known as ""hot"" and ""cold"" wallets. A ""cold"" wallet can be nothing more than writing down a digital key to access one's Bitcoin on a scrap of paper for later use, or storing data on a thumb drive. Thieves can steal Bitcoin by accessing it through a computer network, or by taking the physical storage material.   Many Bitcoin supporters have said that the collapse of Mt. Gox is part of the shake-out of the early, less sophisticated Bitcoin companies that have lost ground to newer, more well-oiled businesses. ""I think that it's yet another illustration of how incompetently managed that hobbyist operation was,"" said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities who has written about Bitcoin. ""That you can lose that much Bitcoin and then find it tells you that we're not talking about robust levels of security and control."" Mr. Luria said it was likely that Mt. Gox might have initially overestimated the amount of Bitcoin it had lost.  "
"I.R.S. Says Bitcoin Should Be Considered Property, Not Currency","The Internal Revenue Service announced on Tuesday that Bitcoin should be viewed and taxed as property, giving a little clarity to the shifting regulatory landscape of virtual currency. Despite the fact that many users treat Bitcoin like a regulated currency, ""it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction,"" the agency said. That means that employers who choose to pay wages in Bitcoins will have to report those wages just like any other payment made with property, and Bitcoin income will be subject to the normal federal income withholding and payroll taxes. Shortly after the announcement, Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, praised the decision by the I.R.S. ""The Internal Revenue Service's guidance today provides clarity for taxpayers who want to ensure that they're doing the right thing and playing by the rules when utilizing Bitcoin and other digital currencies,"" he said.  Bitcoin, the computer-driven virtual currency that has gained momentum since it first popped up in 2009, has presented challenges for regulators. It has attracted a growing following of users and merchants, but it has no central bank and no government oversight. In the wake of the collapse of one of the largest online exchanges for buying and selling Bitcoin last month, governments around the world have stepped up their efforts to figure out a way to protect consumers against fraud and other illegal activities. The I.R.S.'s announcement also included a question-and-answer section:   Q-1: How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes?   A-1: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.   Q-2: Is virtual currency treated as currency for purposes of determining whether a transaction results in foreign currency gain or loss under U.S. federal tax laws?   A-2: No. Under currently applicable law, virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss for U.S. federal tax purposes.   Q-3: Must a taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services include in computing gross income the fair market value of the virtual currency?   A-3: Yes. A taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services must, in computing gross income, include the fair market value of the virtual currency, measured in U.S. dollars, as of the date that the virtual currency was received. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on miscellaneous income from exchanges involving property or services.   Q-4: What is the basis of virtual currency received as payment for goods or services in Q&A-3?   A-4: The basis of virtual currency that a taxpayer receives as payment for goods or services in Q&A-3 is the fair market value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date of receipt. See Publication 551, Basis of Assets, for more information on the computation of basis when property is received for goods or services.   Q-5: How is the fair market value of virtual currency determined?   A-5: For U.S. tax purposes, transactions using virtual currency must be reported in U.S. dollars. Therefore, taxpayers will be required to determine the fair market value of virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date of payment or receipt. If a virtual currency is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, the fair market value of the virtual currency is determined by converting the virtual currency into U.S. dollars (or into another real currency which in turn can be converted into U.S. dollars) at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.   Q-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for other property?   A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer's adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable gain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency. See Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, for information about the tax treatment of sales and exchanges, such as whether a loss is deductible.   Q-7: What type of gain or loss does a taxpayer realize on the sale or exchange of virtual currency?   A-7: The character of the gain or loss generally depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. A taxpayer generally realizes capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. For example, stocks, bonds, and other investment property are generally capital assets. A taxpayer generally realizes ordinary gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is not a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. Inventory and other property held mainly for sale to customers in a trade or business are examples of property that is not a capital asset. See Publication 544 for more information about capital assets and the character of gain or loss.   Q-8: Does a taxpayer who ""mines"" virtual currency (for example, uses computer resources to validate Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin transaction ledger) realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency resulting from those activities?   A-8: Yes, when a taxpayer successfully ""mines"" virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on taxable income.   Q-9: Is an individual who ""mines"" virtual currency as a trade or business subject to self-employment tax on the income derived from those activities?   A-9: If a taxpayer's ""mining"" of virtual currency constitutes a trade or business, and the ""mining"" activity is not undertaken by the taxpayer as an employee, the net earnings from self-employment (generally, gross income derived from carrying on a trade or business less allowable deductions) resulting from those activities constitute self-employment income and are subject to the self-employment tax. See Chapter 10 of Publication 334, Tax Guide for Small Business, for more information on self-employment tax and Publication 535, Business Expenses, for more information on determining whether expenses are from a business activity carried on to make a profit.   Q-10: Does virtual currency received by an independent contractor for performing services constitute self employment income?   A-10: Yes. Generally, self employment income includes all gross income derived by an individual from any trade or business carried on by the individual as other than an employee. Consequently, the fair market value of virtual currency received for services performed as an independent contractor, measured in U.S. dollars as of the date of receipt, constitutes self employment income and is subject to the self-employment tax. See FS-2007-18, April 2007, Business or Hobby? Answer Has Implications for Deductions, for information on determining whether an activity is a business or a hobby.   Q-11: Does virtual currency paid by an employer as remuneration for services constitute wages for employment tax purposes?   A-11: Yes. Generally, the medium in which remuneration for services is paid is immaterial to the determination of whether the remuneration constitutes wages for employment tax purposes. Consequently, the fair market value of virtual currency paid as wages is subject to federal income tax withholding, Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax, and Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) tax and must be reported on Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. See Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide, for information on the withholding, depositing, reporting, and paying of employment taxes.   Q-12: Is a payment made using virtual currency subject to information reporting?   A-12: A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property. For example, a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment of fixed and determinable income using virtual currency with a value of $600 or more to a U.S. non-exempt recipient in a taxable year is required to report the payment to the IRS and to the payee. Examples of payments of fixed and determinable income include rent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, and compensation.   Q-13: Is a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment using virtual currency worth $600 or more to an independent contractor for performing services required to file an information return with the IRS?    A-13: Generally, a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment of $600 or more in a taxable year to an independent contractor for the performance of services is required to report that payment to the IRS and to the payee on Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income. Payments of virtual currency required to be reported on Form 1099-MISC should be reported using the fair market value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date of payment. The payment recipient may have income even if the recipient does not receive a Form 1099-MISC. See the Instructions to Form 1099-MISC and the General Instructions for Certain Information Returns for more information. For payments to non-U.S. persons, see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities.   Q-14: Are payments made using virtual currency subject to backup withholding?   A-14: Payments made using virtual currency are subject to backup withholding to the same extent as other payments made in property. Therefore, payors making reportable payments using virtual currency must solicit a taxpayer identification number (TIN) from the payee. The payor must backup withhold from the payment if a TIN is not obtained prior to payment or if the payor receives notification from the IRS that backup withholding is required. See Publication 1281, Backup Withholding for Missing and Incorrect Name/TINs, for more information.  Q-15: Are there IRS information reporting requirements for a person who settles payments made in virtual currency on behalf of merchants that accept virtual currency from their customers?   A-15: Yes, if certain requirements are met. In general, a third party that contracts with a substantial number of unrelated merchants to settle payments between the merchants and their customers is a third party settlement organization (TPSO). A TPSO is required to report payments made to a merchant on a Form 1099-K, Payment Card and Third Party Network Transactions, if, for the calendar year, both (1) the number of transactions settled for the merchant exceeds 200, and (2) the gross amount of payments made to the merchant exceeds $20,000. When completing Boxes 1, 3, and 5a-1 on the Form 1099-K, transactions where the TPSO settles payments made with virtual currency are aggregated with transactions where the TPSO settles payments made with real currency to determine the total amounts to be reported in those boxes. When determining whether the transactions are reportable, the value of the virtual currency is the fair market value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars on the date of payment. See The Third Party Information Reporting Center, http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Third-Party-Reporting-Information-Center, for more information on reporting transactions on Form 1099-K.   Q-16: Will taxpayers be subject to penalties for having treated a virtual currency transaction in a manner that is inconsistent with this notice prior to March 25, 2014?   A-16: Taxpayers may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with tax laws. For example, underpayments attributable to virtual currency transactions may be subject to penalties, such as accuracy-related penalties under section 6662. In addition, failure to timely or correctly report virtual currency transactions when required to do so may be subject to information reporting penalties under section 6721 and 6722. However, penalty relief may be available to taxpayers and persons required to file an information return who are able to establish that the underpayment or failure to properly file information returns is due to reasonable cause.  "
"Taxes Won't Kill Bitcoin, but Tax Reporting Might","Bitcoin is a digital representation of value, not a real currency, according to the latest pronouncement from the Internal Revenue Service. The I.R.S. on Tuesday released guidance indicating that Bitcoins and other so-called virtual currencies that do not have the status of legal tender in any jurisdiction would be treated as property, not currency, for tax purposes. The guidance also indicates that Bitcoin transactions are subject to the same information reporting and withholding requirements as similar transactions in dollars. There were ""no real surprises"" in the guidance, according to Omri Marian, a University of Florida law professor who has written about the potential for Bitcoin to be used to evade taxes. The I.R.S. guidance follows similar action by taxation authorities in Japan, Canada and Australia.  Until Tuesday, Bitcoin users have been forced to speculate about the proper tax treatment of actions such as mining Bitcoins, performing services in exchange for Bitcoins, or buying and selling items denominated in Bitcoins.  While most tax experts agreed that such transactions were taxable, it was unclear if the Bitcoins themselves, once acquired, were capital assets. The I.R.S. guidance, Notice 2014-21, sensibly takes the position that Bitcoin is property, not currency, for tax purposes. Investors who buy Bitcoins can treat those Bitcoins as capital assets, potentially qualifying for the lower tax rate applicable to certain capital gains.  Gains or losses in foreign currency transactions generally give rise to ordinary income or loss under section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Neither the tax code nor the I.R.S. guidance defines the term ""currency,"" although one can perhaps infer its meaning to be fiat currency accepted as legal tender in a country or jurisdiction. Transactions in foreign currency normally generate ordinary income or loss, not capital gains or losses. For instance, if you buy euros today for $100 and sell them a year from now for $120, you have $20 of ordinary income, even if you were holding the euros for investment purposes. The guidance is important to prevent whipsaw. In the absence of guidance, taxpayers holding Bitcoins for investment purposes might report capital gains if they appreciate, but ordinary losses if they depreciate. The I.R.S. guidance requires taxpayers to use one method or the other, depending on their trade or business.   A few opportunities for gamesmanship remain. Determining the value of a Bitcoin is more subjective than determining the value of a foreign currency. Taxpayers are supposed to convert the value of Bitcoin into dollars by looking up the exchange rate at the time of their transactions.  But the Bitcoin market is not as stable and efficient as the market for foreign currencies. Different online exchanges list different prices. While the I.R.S. says that Bitcoin users are expected to make conversion calculations in a ""reasonable manner that is consistently applied,"" aggressive taxpayers might shade values in their favor for tax purposes.  From a business perspective, the most important aspect of the guidance may be buried in the plumbing. Payments made using virtual currency are now clearly subject to the same information and backup withholding requirements as other property transactions.  Suppose you are self-employed, and you hire a virtual assistant in the Philippines to help manage your administrative tasks, and that person accepts payment in Bitcoin. Under the I.R.S. guidance, you have to obtain a taxpayer identification number from the assistant, just as if you were paying the person in dollars.  To the extent that Bitcoin's success depends on anonymity and on avoiding the burden of government regulation, this I.R.S. guidance is an unwelcome blow. Bitcoin users are not accustomed to telling their counterparties who they are, let alone what their Social Security number is.  While some people may choose to ignore the I.R.S. guidance, more established digital economy merchants (like Etsy and eBay vendors) and settlement systems (like PayPal) will tend to comply.  Bitcoin cannot thrive in the underground economy alone, and unless its users pay taxes like other grown-ups, the I.R.S. guidance virtually ensures that it will be a passing fad.   "
"Bitcoin at a 'Fork in the Road,' Analyst Says","The guidance that the Internal Revenue Service provided on Tuesday that  Bitcoin should be treated as property rather than as currency for tax purposes has prompted a fair amount of commentary, including a Standard Deduction column by DealBook's Victor Fleischer.  Steven Englander, the chief foreign exchange strategist for Citigroup,  sees the I.R.S. decision as ending ""a couple of Bitcoin mythologies""  and possibly nudging  virtual currencies toward becoming mainstream payment systems. In a note sent out on Thursday night, Mr. Englander  said that the belief that one can operate outside the financial system and conduct transactions of any significant size anonymously has been shattered. He also pointed to ""a real fork in the road between the Bitcoin as an asset and Bitcoin as a transactions medium."" Many consumers and retailers may use the generic Bitcoin transactions technology, saving on the transactions charge from conventional credit card and money transfer companies, but avoiding the I.R.S. reporting burden. So they will want to transact in Bitcoin, but not hold it, and they will be pretty much indifferent which [digital currency] they use. Exposure will be infinitesimally short. Mr. Englander argues that it is difficult to see how Bitcoin itself can have value ""when consumers and businesses actually seek to avoid holding it as an asset."" We come back to the view that if Bitcoin will evolve into a payments technology, it will be simpler to have $coin and (EURO)coin which will suffice for almost all transactions. In the same way that the exposure to Bitcoin can be made infinitesimally small in transactions, FX exposure can be made similarly small in cross-border transactions.  "
Readers Respond: How Should Apple Spend Its Billions?," So much money, so many options. My column this week, ""Apple's Deep Pockets: What $159 Billion Could Do,"" asked how Apple should spend all the cash the company has sitting in the bank, and the topic generated a pretty boisterous response from readers. People suggested building an Apple television, paying more taxes and even curing cancer.  And they were just getting warmed up. Several readers suggested that Apple buy a media company. Mo from Los Angeles said the company should have purchased Time Warner, giving Apple a treasure trove of movies and television shows that could be distributed on the Apple TV, iPad and elsewhere. Another reader said Apple could buy Comcast, also for the content. ""For today's market cap of $127.3 billion, they could own the largest cable TV provider, a broadband provider, a TV network and a movie studio,"" wrote a reader from Chicago. Gary Tsarsis, a visiting professor of finance at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, said that there are similarities between Apple and Disney, both of which are seeking to expand the distribution of content, and the two companies should explore merging. ""If the inherent interest of the corporation is to maximize shareholder value, then for Apple, they should be using the vast amount of cash that they have on their balance sheet for profit-seeking opportunities,"" Mr. Tsarsis said in an email. ""The money, at best, is getting minimal interest in the Netherlands, Ireland, etc. and becomes a drag on growth when not being used."" But perhaps the most vociferous response came from people who said Apple should pay more taxes. The company has been criticized in recent years for sidestepping taxes.  ""There are two things Apple could do with its $159 billion: Actually pay its fair share of U.S. corporate taxes instead of hiding or moving its money around,"" one reader wrote. Another echoed the same sentiment: ""How about they pay some of the taxes they owe?"" Some readers said that Apple and other tech giants with huge cash reserves should do more to help social causes. ""I have no doubt that Google, Apple and Microsoft employ some of the best and the brightest people that money can hire,"" wrote a reader from New York City. ""Why not divert some of that talent and some of that excess cash in a joint effort to find a cure for cancer?"" Other suggestions included paying for college education for thousands of students, hiring teachers and funding science research. And finally, one reader suggested betting big on Bitcoin, the crypto-currency. ""Apple should buy Bitcoin and establish itself as the world's largest Bitcoin bank and payment processor,"" the reader said.  "
Colorado Lawmaker to Accept Donations in Bitcoin,"Jared Polis may be the first politician to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin. Mr. Polis, a former technology entrepreneur and a current congressman from Colorado, has wasted no time in making his campaign more accessible to virtual currency enthusiasts. On Thursday, the same day that the Federal Election Commission said that it would allow such donations, his office announced that supporters could use Bitcoins to donate to Mr. Polis's campaign for re-election in November.  The F.E.C. was prompted by a request from Make Your Laws PAC, a political action committee based in North Carolina that says on its website that its mission ""is to allow normal citizens to directly participate in every aspect of their legislative process, worldwide.""  In February, Make Your Laws sent the commission a letter requesting that it explain how donors could make campaign contributions using virtual currency, according to records on the F.E.C.'s website. A representative for Make Your Laws could not immediately be reached for comment. Once the territory of technology enthusiasts and anti-establishment libertarian types, Bitcoin has gained wider adoption, in part due to the growing number of businesses that are trying to bring virtual currency further into the mainstream. One such business is Coinbase, which acts as a middleman between merchants and consumers. Consumers can use Coinbase to exchange their Bitcoins into dollars for payments at a growing number of businesses, including Overstock.com and the online dating website OkCupid. Mr. Polis's campaign is also using Coinbase to allow supporters to make donations, a spokesman for Coinbase, John O'Brien, confirmed. So far, the campaign has raised more than $1,000 in Bitcoin donations, according to Lisa Kaufmann, a campaign spokeswoman.  ""One of those things that people do online is give to candidates, so we want to make that available to them,"" Mr. Polis said in an interview on Friday, adding that the Bitcoin donations will be subject to all the same reporting requirements as donations given in dollars.  Mr. Polis said his campaign had been working to set up a Bitcoin payment site in anticipation of the F.E.C.'s ruling. Bitcoin, the computer-driven currency that requires solving complicated mathematical riddles, has no central bank or regulator. In recent months, it has come under scrutiny from federal authorities for its potential to aid money laundering and other illicit activities. Regulators are also concerned about the potential harm to investors. On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an alert to warn investors about ""the potential risks of investments involving Bitcoin and other forms of virtual currency."" That has made virtual currency somewhat controversial. But Mr. Polis, a Democrat who made a fortune as co-founder of the online greeting card website bluemountain.com, is not worried about potential negative attention. ""Most illegal transactions for drugs or illegal weapons occur in dollars, and most politicians accept dollars,"" he said.  "
"Marc Andreessen on the Future of Silicon Valley(s), and the Next Big Technology","Silicon Valley is starting to feel a little less exuberant these days. Some big start-ups are having trouble raising money. Others are delaying plans to go public. Hot new technologies like Bitcoin have been struggling.With all the nervous chatter out there - Where is this going? What's next? - I called on Marc Andreessen, who has lived through a bubble or two (or three). Mr. Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist, has been at the epicenter of the technology business here for two decades. In the early 1990s, he was a co-founder of one of the first major web browsers, Netscape. He went on to start Ning, an early social site. Now, in addition to being voluble on Twitter, he sits on the board of Facebook, eBay and Hewlett-Packard.  I got 28 minutes with him. But Mr. Andreessen speaks so quickly, it felt like an hour and a half. Saying ""bubble"" to a venture capitalist around here is like saying ""homework"" to a teenager. They roll their eyes and try to shoo you away. So rather than ask if we are in the middle of another - ahem - bubble, I asked Mr. Andreessen why some young companies can't seem to raise all the money they want. His answer: conditions ebb and flow. And right now, they are ebbing for some companies. But for others, capital is still available. ""We have not seen any pullback so far on private investment,"" Mr. Andreessen said. ""Actually, what we're seeing is more of the opposite right now. We're seeing a lot more institutional money - in particular from the hedge fund world - crossing over"" into tech investing. But what about companies that can't find their way to the stock market, like Box and Square? Mr. Andreessen pointed to 1997 and 1998, when the market for initial public stock offerings was briefly derailed by the Asian financial crisis. Before long, investor interest revved up again, and the Nasdaq stock market was flying high. (A few years later, of course, it came crashing down.) So if a start-up can't go public just now, it's no big deal. ""The nature of the public market is that it is maniac depressive,"" Mr. Andreessen said. ""It gets excited, it gets depressed."" Speaking of feeling down, I asked Mr. Andreessen a question I often hear from people outside Silicon Valley: Why can't other places build their own valley-style tech hubs? People in cities ranging from Dublin to Berlin to New York often ask what they are doing wrong. Mr. Andreessen said new valleys will eventually emerge. But they won't be Silicon Valley copycats. Over the past couple of years, venture firms have invested in start-ups in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and all over China. L.A., for example, is home to Snapchat, Tinder, Whisper, Oculus VR and Beats, some of the big tech stories of the year. Mr. Andreessen said another hot place is Atlanta, the home of Georgia Tech. But he offers a caveat. ""My personal view is that Silicon Valley will continue to take a disproportionate share of the No. 1 positions in great new markets, and I think that's just a reflection that the fact that the valley works as well as it does,"" Mr. Andreessen said. There is a caveat to his caveat. In Mr. Andreessen's view, there shouldn't be 50 Silicon Valleys. Instead, there should be 50 different kinds of Silicon Valley. For example, there could be Biotech Valley, a Stem Cell Valley, a 3-D Printing Valley or a Drone Valley. As he noted, there are huge regulatory hurdles in many of these fields. If a city wanted to spur innovation around drones, for instance, it might have to remove any local legal barriers to flying unnamed aircraft. So what kind of valley would Marc Andreessen build? He is a big believer in digital currencies like Bitcoin, as well as in virtual reality. He says enterprises like Bitcoin will change the world on the scale that web browsers did. And before long, virtual reality will be, well, reality. Don't believe him? Mr. Andreessen recalled similar skepticism in May 1994 when he was showing media and telecommunications executives this bizarre development called a web browser. ""They pretty much told us we were out of minds and to go away,"" he said. Five years later, Netscape was sold to AOL for $4.2 billion. Finally, I couldn't end my discussion without asking him about Twitter. Over the past several months Mr. Andreessen has become a mantle on the social network, known for his long stream of tweets that have become known as the ""Marc Andreessen tweetstorm."" So Mr. Andreessen, why the long tweets? ""My view is that 140 characters doesn't make sense anymore,"" he said. ""If it was me, I'd immediately raise the limit to 300 or 400 characters."" But if that doesn't happen, he's incredibly bullish on the service just the way it is. ""The counterargument is that there is magic to the limitation,"" he said, laying out a number of virtues around the limited character lengths. ""If Twitter doesn't adapt, I would not view them as being stupid. I just hope they change it because it would be a lot better for me.""  "
Dish Network to Accept Bitcoin,"Dish Network customers will soon be able to pay their bills in Bitcoin in a move that pushes the virtual currency a little further into the mainstream. Dish Network, one of the country's largest pay-television operators that counts 14 million subscribers, said on Thursday that it would become the largest company to begin accepting Bitcoin. Starting in the third-quarter, customers will be able to make one-time payments using the virtual money. ""It's another big milestone,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who has studied Bitcoin. ""This is a mainstream company with mainstream leadership that's decided to embrace Bitcoin and what Bitcoin technology offers.""  While Dish isn't the first company to accept the virtual currency, it claims to be the largest. Retailers such as Overstock.com, Virgin America and others already allow for Bitcoin purchases. Users access Bitcoin by buying them from one another on online exchanges, or unlocking new coins by solving complicated mathematical equations. When it first appeared in 2009, the computer-driven currency offered a cheaper payment system that allowed people to bypass the established banking industry. Since then, Bitcoin's following has evolved from technology enthusiasts and anti-establishment types to include a more mainstream audience. That soon attracted entrepreneurs backed by established venture capital firms looking to start new businesses to capitalize on a growing market. ""It doesn't seem like this has anything to do with the politics of Bitcoin and the ideology of Bitcoin, it has to do with the business of Bitcoin,"" Mr. Luria said of Dish's announcement. But the wider adoption has drawn increased scrutiny to Bitcoin's volatility and regulation. The price of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly, from a few cents in the beginning to more than a thousand dollars to its current price of about $565, according to the online index Coindesk. In February, Mt. Gox, the once-dominant online exchange for the virtual currency, collapsed amid a swirl of rumors that  hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins had been stolen. The company initially announced that nearly all of its 744,000 customer coins had gone missing. The collapse prompted a scramble among regulators to impose new rules that would protect consumers and prevent future illicit activity. The Mt. Gox collapse also came after federal prosecutors shut down Silk Road, accusing the online marketplace of facilitating drug deals and other illicit transactions. But Bitcoin enthusiasts have said that the closing of some of Bitcoin's early institutions paves the way for newer, more sophisticated companies that can help move Bitcoin further into the mainstream. ""We always want to deliver choice and convenience for our customers and that includes the method they use to pay their bills,"" said Bernie Han, Dish's executive vice president and chief operating officer, in a statement. ""Bitcoin is becoming a preferred way for some people to transact and we want to accommodate those individuals."" One such company is Coinbase, which began with $25 million in funding from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. The company acts as a third-party payment processor, transferring Bitcoin into dollars. That has made it easier for some merchants, like Overstock.com, to accept the virtual currency. Coinbase will also act as the payment processor for Dish customers, the company said in a statement. ""We're excited to support Dish and their current and new subscribers for their Bitcoin transactions,"" said Fred Ehrsam, Coinbase's co-founder. ""This is a large step forward in the growing momentum of customers paying companies in bitcoin for things we do every day, like watching premium TV."" "
Security Flaw Hits Microsoft Browser,"SEATTLE - In case those with personal computers running Windows XP still need a reason to replace or update their machines, Microsoft has just given them a great one with the disclosure of a nasty security hole in the company's web browser, Internet Explorer.   Microsoft issued a warning about the security hole in an advisory on Saturday, warning that attackers can exploit the flaw simply by persuading people to visit websites, where malicious code could be used to steal data from their computers. The company said it was aware of ""limited, targeted attacks"" that tried to exploit the flaw, though it did not provide more details about them.   Although the security flaw affects various versions of Internet Explorer browsers running on newer computers with the Windows 7 and Windows 8 operating systems, the problem is especially troubling for the millions of people still using Windows XP. Because Microsoft ended technical support for Windows XP this month, the company will not issue any security updates for the operating system, including for the flaw disclosed on Saturday.  The flaw was discovered by FireEye Research Labs, part of the security company FireEye Inc. Windows XP was first introduced by Microsoft more than 12 years ago. Computers running the software are comically outdated compared with later machines. That still does not change the fact, however, that more than a quarter of the computers connected to the Internet are still running Windows XP, according to NetMarketShare.  Microsoft is working on a final software update to remedy the security hole in Internet Explorer on its modern operating systems. Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11, the latest, are affected. In the meantime, the company recommends several precautions, including making sure that Internet Explorer is configured to run in enhanced protected mode, to lessen the risks from the security flaw.  The remedy for Windows XP users is more stark: upgrade to a computer running a newer operating system.   "
Cyberattack Insurance a Challenge for Business,"Julia Roberts's smile is insured. So are Heidi Klum's legs, Daniel Craig's body and Jennifer Lopez's derrière. But the fastest-growing niche in the industry today is cyberinsurance. Specialized policies to protect against online attacks are offered by about 50 carriers, including big names like the American International Group, Chubb and Ace. As data breaches have become a reality of the business world, more companies are buying policies; demand increased 21 percent last year from 2012, according to Marsh, a risk management company and insurance broker. Yet companies say it is difficult to get as much coverage as they need, leaving them vulnerable to uncertain losses. The main problem is quantifying losses from attacks, because they are often intangible -- lost sales or damage to a brand name, like the public relations disaster Target suffered after the breach of its point-of-sale systems late last year.  ''The losses that are more tangible and more readily quantifiable are the ones you'll be able to insure against more easily,'' said Ed Powers, who heads the online risk services practice at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm. ''The ones that are less tangible and less quantifiable are more challenging, but those are often the bigger ones.'' At the same time, underwriters lack the data they need to figure out how likely it is that an attack will occur, or what it will cost. This is because most breaches go unnoticed or are never publicly reported. Information on past attacks is not particularly helpful because attackers are always getting more advanced, and the risk is increasing as companies put their most valuable data online. Graeme Newman, a director at CFC Underwriting, said that in underwriting property, insurance companies can draw on reams of data spanning hundreds of years. ''They could tell you exactly the chance of an office building burning down in Midtown Manhattan, but there isn't anyone on this planet who could tell you the probability of a large U.S. retailer being hacked tomorrow,'' Mr. Newman said. ''Statistics from five years ago are almost irrelevant today,'' he added. Total cyberinsurance premiums paid last year reached $1.3 billion, according to Betterley Risk Consultants, a jump from the $1 billion paid in 2012. The bulk of that involves smaller policies issued to small to midsize businesses. The most coverage a company can hope to acquire, using multiple underwriters, is about $300 million, experts say, significantly less than the billions of dollars' worth of coverage available in property insurance. The problems companies face in getting insurance are illustrated by the situation Target faced last year. At the time of its breach, the retailer had cobbled together $100 million in coverage, on top of a $10 million deductible, according to regulatory filings. The coverage, which came from multiple carriers, will barely compensate for the $1 billion in losses some analysts are forecasting. Since the breach was discovered, the company has incurred $88 million in breach-related expenses, its filings say, and it expects insurance to cover $52 million of that. Target had tried to get more insurance; at least one carrier had turned it down, according to a person briefed on the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Cyberinsurance has existed since the 1990s, but companies were forced to consider coverage when a New York court ruled in February that Sony's general liability policy would not cover the $2 billion in costs the company incurred from the huge data breach in 2011 involving the online network for its PlayStation game console. Cyberinsurance policies vary widely. The most comprehensive ones reimburse for immediate cleanup costs like hiring a forensics firm, notifying customers, setting up call centers and paying for free credit monitoring. Some also cover legal fees and the cost of hiring a crisis management firm. But those costs can be only the tip of the iceberg, experts say. For example, after the breach at Target, its profit was cut nearly in half -- down 46 percent over the same period the year before -- in large part because the breach scared away its customers. The loss to the brand is essentially unmeasurable. ''There is no real way to put empirical data on what the value of a brand is post-breach, during a breach and prior to a breach,'' said Michael Tanenbaum, senior vice president of ACE Professional Risk, part of Ace. ''We are about science and math, and you just can't get your arms around it. And two people can't always agree on whether a brand has been diminished.'' To regain consumer confidence, Target announced that it would speed the adoption of more secure chip-and-PIN technology in its stores and for its branded debit and credit cards, a step it estimates will cost $100 million. That expense is not covered by its insurance policies. Policies also exclude some major forms of breach, like state-sponsored online espionage attacks, which tripled last year, according to a recent Verizon report. ''Most companies think their policy will cover them from all cyberevents, but in reality it only kicks in in a sliver of breach events,'' said Jacob Olcott, a cybersecurity expert at Good Harbor Security Risk Management, which advises companies on the risk. Some experts say insurers keep policies narrow simply because there are too many unknowns. In most cases, insurers use questionnaires to determine a client's risk of a breach. Rarely, Mr. Olcott said, they will perform a penetration test, in which paid hackers try to break into a company's network to identify its weak spots. ''They won't do the due diligence you might expect,'' he said. More data about breaches has been forced into the open because of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa, of 1996, which established strict security and privacy standards for patient data and became a model for many state breach notification laws. Insurers say those laws have forced more companies to step forward when data is lost, creating more actuarial data for underwriters to draw upon. Last year, the Ponemon Institute, a nonprofit that tracks breaches, estimated that the cost of a data breach was $188 per compromised record, with 28,765 records breached on average in the year. Still, risk experts say that those figures reflect only upfront cleanup costs and grossly underestimate the cost to companies when trade secrets are stolen or reputational damage occurs. The market continues to evolve. Recently, A.I.G. became the first insurer to expand its cybercoverage to include physical risks, like property damage and bodily injury. If an attack on an oil company resulted in an explosion, damage from that could now be covered, said Tracie Grella, global head of professional liability at A.I.G. Another wrinkle in the market is the uncertainty over how to assess the risk of cloud computing services, which increasingly are the repository for all sorts of data maintained by businesses. A big question is whether the aggregation of data from many companies in a cloud service like Amazon's is safer or more vulnerable. One breach could mean catastrophic loss for many companies. But some businesses might be better off outsourcing their data to a large cloud provider like Amazon that has greater resources to protect it, said Ty Sagalow, a former chief operating officer at A.I.G. who is now a president of an insurance consulting group. Whatever the complexities, cyberinsurance is now big business. ''Insurers can't afford not to be in this thing,'' Mr. Sagalow said. "
"After Arrest of Accused Hacker, Russia Accuses U.S. of Kidnapping","SAN FRANCISCO - On the web, he was known by his hacker handle, ""Track2,"" a nod to his skill in stealing so-called track data from hundreds of thousands of credit cards and selling it for millions of dollars in the digital underground. In real life, he was Roman Valerevich Seleznev, 30, believed to be one of the world's most prolific traffickers of stolen financial information, according to a statement released Monday by the United States Secret Service. He was also, according to Russia's foreign ministry, the son of Valery Seleznev, a prominent member of Russian Parliament's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party.  Now, one day after his arrest in Guam, Roman Seleznev is at the center of a dispute between the United States and Russia. The United States Justice Department has been conspicuously tight-lipped about the details of Roman Seleznev's arrest, other than to say he was arrested in Guam on Saturday on charges that he hacked into retailers across the United States from 2009 to 2011. According to Russia's foreign ministry, Roman Seleznev was ""kidnapped"" by the United States as he boarded a plane in the Maldives on Saturday, and was forcefully transferred to Guam. ""We consider this the latest unfriendly move from Washington,"" the ministry said in a statement, which accused the United States of violating a bilateral treaty on mutual assistance in criminal matters. The Justice Department denied Tuesday that the United States had violated any treaties in detaining Mr. Seleznev but  offered few details. ""Seleznev was arrested by another country at the request of the U.S. and was taken into U.S. custody following his expulsion from that country, which acted under its own laws,"" said Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman. ""He was advised of his rights and given consular notification. These actions also were in no way inconsistent with any treaty arrangements with Russia."" In an interview with the Russian government's overseas broadcast network, Russia Today, Valery Seleznev, said his son could not be guilty of the charges because he had only average computer skills after he was disabled from an April 2011 terrorist bombing in Marrakesh, Morocco. (The bombing took place one month after the Justice Department first indicted Mr. Seleznev on hacking United States retailers from October 2009 to February 2011). The elder Mr. Seleznev speculated his son's arrest was retaliation for Russia's harboring of former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. ""For all I know they may be demanding a ransom tomorrow or try to exchange him for Snowden or somebody,"" Mr. Seleznev told Russia Today. The younger Mr. Seleznev appeared before a court in Guam on Monday. According to a Justice Department indictment, Mr. Seleznev is accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of credit card numbers from a range of businesses, including the Broadway Grill in Seattle, the Phoenix Zoo and  Schlotzsky's Deli chain, and selling them for millions of dollars on underground sites like bulba.cc and Track2.name. He faces five counts of bank fraud, eight counts of intentionally causing damage to a protected computer, eight counts of obtaining information from a protected computer, one count of possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices, two counts of trafficking unauthorized access devices, and five counts of aggravated identity theft. Those are the charges he faces in the Western District of Washington State, which is prosecuting his case. He also faces similar charges in the District of Nevada, where he faces a separate indictment on charges of racketeering as well as two counts of possession of 15 or more counterfeit and unauthorized access devices. He will be held in custody in Guam until his next hearing in two weeks. If convicted of just the bank fraud, he faces up to 30 years in prison. The other charges also carry significant sentences. Arrests of hackers are rare in Russia, even when individuals have been outed by outside groups like the Spamhaus Project, a nonprofit spam-prevention service in Europe. Security experts say that is in large part because while many cybercriminals are based in Russia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the vast majority of their victims are in the United States and Europe. Mr. Seleznev has remained at large since March 2011, when he was first indicted for hacking in-store cash register systems in the United States from October 2009 to February 2011. In a statement, Russia's foreign ministry said that in arresting Mr. Seleznev and bringing him to Guam, the United States had ignored international treaties with both Russia and the Maldives. The ministry compared the situation to the arrest of Viktor Bout, a former Soviet Air Force officer, who was arrested in an American-led sting operation in Thailand in 2008 and later convicted of conspiring to sell weapons to kill Americans. Then too, Russia's foreign ministry called the charges against Mr. Bout ""baseless and biased"" and warned it could hamper relations between Moscow and Washington. But Mr. Seleznev's case is perhaps more reminiscent of the 2002 case of Vasily Gorshkov. Rather than enlist Russian authorities' help, the Federal Bureau of Investigation lured him to the United States with a fake offer of a job interview and arrested him. To gather evidence in that case, F.B.I. analysts hacked into Mr. Gorshkov's computer in Russia, which Russian officials said violated a 1997 agreement that mandates ""investigation and prosecution of international high-tech crimes must be coordinated among all concerned states, regardless of where harm has occurred."" Ultimately, a Washington State judge was unreceptive to arguments the F.B.I. had overstepped its search and seizure authority and sentenced Mr. Gorshkov to three years in prison. In a statement following Mr. Seleznev's arrest, Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, said, ""This important arrest sends a clear message: despite the increasingly borderless nature of transnational organized crime, the long arm of justice - and this department will continue to disrupt and dismantle sophisticated criminal organizations.""

"Target Puts Data Breach Costs at $148 Million, and Forecasts Profit Drop","Target, still feeling the pain from a huge data breach last year, said in a security filing on Tuesday that costs associated with the episode reached $148 million in the second quarter.  The company also said it expected earnings to drop to 78 cents a share from its earlier projections of 85 cents to $1 a share, reflecting more cautious consumer spending. In the filing, John Mulligan, Target's interim president and chief executive, said the company has been committed to being open about the costs. ''With the benefit of additional information, we believe that today is an appropriate time to provide greater clarity on this topic,'' he said. In December, Target disclosed that online thieves hacked into its computer system, stealing credit card or personal information from more than 100 million customers. Both personal data and credit card information may have been stolen from about 12 million people. The company has already spent tens of millions of dollars on breach-related costs since then. In January, Target announced it would offer a year of free credit screening services to any customers who believe their data may have been compromised by the attack. John Kindervag, the vice president and principal analyst with Forrester Research, estimated that costs would rise even more over time. ''I don't see how they're getting out of this for under a billion, over time,'' he said, adding, ''$150 million in a quarter seems almost like a bargain.'' Target also acknowledged some fault for the attack. In the months that followed, the company said it had missed certain warning signs about potential security gaps. As a result, Gregg Steinhafel, the former chief executive, resigned in May. Last week, the company announced that it had appointed Brian Cornell, who most recently served as chief executive at PepsiCo Americas Foods, as the company's next chairman and chief executive. He will take up his new roles next week. The $148 million in breach-related costs will be partly offset by a $38 million insurance payout, the company said in its filing. In the past, the company has attributed some of the breach-related costs to legal, consulting and credit monitoring services. Target continues to struggle elsewhere, including in its expansion into Canada. The retailer quickly opened more than 100 locations, but reported disappointing profit margins, one reason the company cited for its sagging second-quarter projections. ''While the environment in both the U.S. and Canada continues to be challenging, and results aren't yet where they need to be, we are making progress in our efforts to drive U.S. traffic and sales, improve our Canadian operations and advance Target's digital transformation,'' Mr. Mulligan said. Target shares closed down 4.4 percent, at $58.03. The company will announce earnings for the second quarter this month. ''I think investors are probably not going to be too thrilled with this,'' Mr. Kindervag said. ''They're really in a difficult place. It's going to take them a long time to build the trust of the shopper and get them to where they were prior to December 2013.'' "
A Better Credit Card,"American banks and retailers are finally embracing credit card technology that has been shown to minimize fraudulent transactions in the rest of the world. Given recent data breaches in which hackers stole the card numbers of millions of consumers from cash register systems at retailers like Target and Supervalu, the change can't come soon enough.  The new cards, which contain computer chips, are standard in Europe and more secure against hacking than the magnetic-stripe cards widely used in the United States. Users of chip-based cards in Europe have to enter a four-digit code on a keypad to complete purchases, adding another layer of security. Industry groups in Britain and Canada have reported that credit card fraud dropped sharply after banks and merchants switched to such cards. American credit card companies plan to issue more than 575 million chip-based cards by the end of 2015, and retailers like Walmart and Target are installing thousands of registers where the new cards can be used. But some banks will initially only require customers to sign for purchases when using chip-based cards rather than requiring the extra step of entering a secure code. The banks say they will add the code step once consumers become accustomed to using the new cards. One reason for the delay in conversion to chip-based cards is that banks were not willing to upgrade their systems until retailers did the same. But the publicity surrounding the data breaches changed a lot of minds, as did the fact that stricter rules governing liability for fraud-related losses will take effect a little over a year from now. Under the new rules, if one entity, the retailer or the credit card firm, is using the less-secure system, it will be held liable for losses. One big problem that chip-based cards will not address is fraud linked to purchases made over the Internet. Industry officials say they are working on various approaches to making online purchases more secure. For example, credit card companies could verify the identity of online shoppers by sending a text message to their cellphones with a unique code when they try to buy something on, say, Amazon. The customer would then have to enter that code on Amazon to complete the transaction. Some companies like MasterCard are already offering such features, but they are not in wide use. No technology can eliminate fraud. But chip-based cards can make it harder for criminals to profit. "
"With New Apple Products, a Privacy Challenge","No one has considered Apple a serious data company, until now. For years, Apple has offered Internet services like email and online calendars. But Tuesday, with the introduction of health-monitoring technology and a new service that will allow people to buy things wirelessly with some Apple devices, the Cupertino, Calif., company positioned itself as a caretaker of valuable personal information, like credit card numbers and heart rates. Talk about unfortunate timing. Just last week, a number of celebrities, including the Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, discovered that hackers broke into their Apple accounts, stole nude or provocative photos, and posted those photos on the Internet. Even though Apple found no widespread breach of its online service, the company's ability to protect its customers' private information -- for perhaps the first time -- was openly questioned.  Against that background, Apple faces two threats to its new services: one from hackers always looking for clever ways to steal financial information, and another from regulators increasingly interested in ensuring that information gleaned from health monitoring devices stays private. So Apple executives, in a two-hour presentation and in media interviews Tuesday, were careful to explain what the company planned to do with the information users were sharing through the health-monitoring capabilities of a smartwatch called the Apple Watch, which will be available next year, and its new payment service, Apple Pay. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, said in an interview that in contrast to companies like Amazon and Google that relied on tracking user activity to serve ads or sell things, Apple still primarily made money from selling hardware. With Apple Pay, which will be available next month, Apple does not store any payment information on the devices or on Apple's servers. It simply acts as a conduit between the merchant and bank. ''We're not looking at it through the lens that most people do of wanting to know what you're buying, where you buy it at, how much you're spending and all these kinds of things,'' he said. ''We could care less.'' Jeff Williams, Apple's head of operations, noted that for the Apple Watch, Apple is forbidding app developers from storing any health information on Apple's iCloud service. He added that all health information logged by the watch would be encrypted on the device and users would decide which apps had access to the data. Some security experts are already pleased by what they see of Apple's payment system. Apple Pay relies on a technology called near-field communication to exchange information wirelessly between devices. The new payment system could also drive faster adoption of a chip-based security feature called EMV, for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, the companies that first backed the technology. EMV is more secure than the magnetic stripes on credit cards because a new string of numbers is created for each purchase, making it difficult for hackers to use a stolen number for another purchase or to counterfeit credit cards. The technology has been widely adopted in Europe, but American banks have been slow to use it. Tom Pageler, the chief information security officer at the computer security company DocuSign, said EMV -- which Apple Pay uses -- could help avoid recent giant breaches at retailers like Target, where the information of 40 million cardholders was stolen. ''If we move to EMV, all that data will be useless to criminals,'' Mr. Pageler said. The Apple Watch will add to a field of health-monitoring devices that is largely unregulated. Personal health sensors, like Fitbit and Jawbone, are not deemed medical devices by the Food and Drug Administration. And personal health data collected by individuals for their own use is outside the federal laws controlling the use of patient information. But regulators are closely watching this fast-growing market, and the Apple Watch will only add to the scrutiny. The F.D.A. has issued a list of mobile applications for which it has warned that it will ''exercise enforcement discretion.'' The list includes software used by individuals to log personal data on activity and exercise, food consumption and sleep patterns, and make suggestions about health and wellness. The key, privacy advocates say, is the practices that govern how personal data is handled and analyzed by the device makers and software developers. ''The Achilles' heel for privacy and consumer protection are apps connected to marketing, where the information can be gathered and used,'' said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. ''I do not believe safeguards are in place to protect consumer health information that will be gathered for profiling and targeting.'' Apple has made it clear to developers of health apps that it wants to protect privacy. Last week, it updated its guidelines for app developers, stating that apps working with HealthKit, Apple's new set of tools for tracking fitness and health statistics, may not use the personal data gathered for advertising or data-mining uses other than for helping manage an individual's health and fitness, or for medical research. The guidelines also say that app developers cannot share data with third parties without the user's consent. ''I think Apple is certainly aware of the privacy issues with health data,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''But whether it really enforces those guidelines to uphold its privacy commitments will be the real test.'' Mark A. McAndrew, a partner with the law firm Taft Stettinius & Hollister, which works with health and science clients, questioned whether Apple had the tools and resources to keep developers in check. Apple already has over one million apps to monitor in its App Store for iPhones and iPads, and occasionally questionable apps get published. ''It may not be as much of an Apple issue as much as it is, How do you police the app developers?'' Mr. McAndrew said.

"Mail Monitoring Rarely Denied, Postal Service Says","WASHINGTON -- The United States Postal Service granted almost all of the nearly 6,700 requests from law enforcement agencies last year to monitor the mail of Americans for use in criminal and national security investigations, Postal Service officials told a House panel on Wednesday. The officials said that only 10 requests had been denied, for a rate of approval that some members of Congress sharply criticized. Cases of monitoring are called mail covers because the collected information comes from the outside of letters and parcels.  ''The fact that 99.85 percent of the mail covers were approved raises serious questions about privacy and the management of the mail covers program,'' said Representative Blake Farenthold, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee responsible for the Postal Service, the panel that heard the testimony. The hearing followed a recent data breach by hackers into the Postal Service's computer system and a May audit by the agency's inspector general that found numerous problems with how the Postal Service runs its mail surveillance program. At the hearing, postal officials sought to assure members of the panel that the agency had adequate controls over the surveillance to protect the privacy and civil liberties of Americans. Guy Cottrell, chief of the Postal Inspection Service, the law enforcement arm of the Postal Service, said the agency had made several changes in the way it managed the mail covers program after the audit in May. The audit found that 21 percent of law enforcement requests to monitor mail had been approved without written authorization from the proper Postal Service officials, and that 13 percent had lacked properly documented explanations for their approval. The audit also found that the Postal Inspection Service had not conducted annual reviews of the mail cover program as required by federal law, and that more than 900 mail covers were still active even though the orders for them had expired. ''We had made substantial progress in addressing the issues raised in the audit,'' Mr. Cottrell told the subcommittee. He provided data showing that the number of mail covers requested by law enforcement agencies had declined to about 6,700 in 2013 from slightly more than 9,400 in 2010. But Mr. Cottrell said the Postal Service's overall use of mail covers, including by its internal law enforcement arm, had jumped to about 57,000 so far this year from about 16,000 in 2012. He said the increase was due to the Postal Inspection Service's use of one-day covers, mostly in cases of suspected drug smuggling through the mail. The one-day covers permit surveillance of a single piece of mail rather than of all the mail going to an individual or business. Under the program, which is more than a century old, local and federal law enforcement officials send requests to the Postal Inspection Service to monitor the mail of individuals or businesses suspected of a crime. The inspection service then directs postal workers to record visible external information on mail sent to the target of an investigation, including names, addresses and postmarks. The process is not subject to judicial review. Law enforcement officials, including Capt. Charles E. Hamby II of the Prince George's County, Md., Police Department, who testified at Wednesday's hearing, said that although mail covers are old-fashioned, they can still be critical to investigations. The agency is updating its computer system, Mr. Cottrell said, to make sure its information on each mail cover is accurate, and it is developing a process to bar law enforcement agencies who abuse the program from being approved for mail covers. The Postal Service also uses a program called Mail Imaging, in which its computers photograph the exterior of every piece of paper mail sent in the United States. The program primarily helps process the mail, but in some cases it allows law enforcement agencies to request stored images of mail sent to and received by people who are under investigation. Timothy H. Edgar, a visiting fellow at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University who was the first director of privacy and civil liberties for the National Security Council in the Obama administration, told the panel that the Mail Imaging program was troubling. ''It raises real questions about the bulk collection of metadata, raises privacy risks and questions about who has access to this data,'' he said. "
"When It Comes to Holiday Shopping, Not All Plastic Is Equal","Over the past year, so many data breaches at retail chains and restaurants have come to light that it's hard to keep track. So what does that mean for shoppers, as the holiday season gets underway? Although it's unnerving to have any sort of card information stolen -- whether by hackers or through an old-fashioned pilfered wallet -- consumer and security experts say the fallout may be less damaging if shoppers avoid debit cards and use credit cards instead. ''One of our biggest concerns is debit cards, because they're linked to your checking account,'' said Richard K. Avery, president of the Northeast region for Securitas Security Services.  With both credit and debit cards, consumers generally aren't liable for charges made with stolen card numbers, as long as the problem is reported within 60 days, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But there could be more headaches with debit cards, because banks have 10 business days to investigate and credit funds to your account. In the meantime, you may be short of money for any bills that come due. ''That's a long time to wait,'' said Gail Hillebrand, the bureau's associate director for consumer education and engagement. And when your physical debit card is lost or stolen or your PIN is compromised, you must notify the bank within two business days in order to limit your liability to $50, the agency says. Otherwise, you could lose up to $500 -- or even more, in the case of a lengthy delay in reporting a problem. In any case, it's best to contact your bank promptly. Credit cards also provide protection in case you are unhappy with goods or services you purchased. You can dispute the charge and withhold payment while the bank sorts things out with the merchant. Nevertheless, many people expect to avoid using credit cards for holiday shopping. A survey released on Nov. 19 by Bankrate.com found that just under a quarter of those who planned to make in-store purchases on Black Friday -- the day after Thanksgiving, which is traditional start of the holiday shopping season -- said they were likely to use credit cards. In comparison, 34 percent said they would use debit cards, and 38 percent planned to use cash. Debt-averse younger shoppers, in particular, prefer debit cards, said Jeanine Skowronski, an analyst with Bankrate. Just 11 percent of 18- to- 29-year-old Black Friday shoppers said they would use a credit card for in-store purchases, and more than half said they would use a debit card for online purchases on Black Friday and the Monday after Thanksgiving, now called Cyber Monday. The telephone survey of 1,000 adults was conducted for Bankrate by Princeton Survey Research Associates International from Oct. 30 to Nov. 2. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points. Here are some questions about keeping your finances safe while shopping: â-  What if I prefer to use a credit card but am worried about overspending? Ms. Skowronski says that you don't have to wait until you get your monthly statement to make payments on your credit card; you can make a payment anytime, whether by check or online. So you could simply shop with your credit card, then pay off your purchases right away, to help stick to your budget and avoid surprises when the bill arrives. Of course, to avoid interest charges, you should pay your balance in full each month. â-  Are some methods of payments more secure? Over the next year, banks will increasingly issue ''chip'' credit and debit cards to their customers. Such cards are more difficult to counterfeit are expected to reduce fraud stemming from in-store payments. Apple Pay, the new contactless payment system that pairs payment card information with the iPhone 6, is promoted as more secure because it creates a unique number for each purchase rather than using your real card number. A drawback is that for now, the number of retailers accepting chip cards and Apple Pay is relatively limited. â-  What about making online shopping safer? Some credit cards offer virtual account numbers that act as a proxy for your real credit card number when you shop online. If your card doesn't offer that option, Mr. Avery of Securitas suggests that you restrict online shopping to one credit card dedicated to online shopping. It's easier to track purchases that way, and if the card is compromised and you cancel the account, you won't have to worry about re-establishing automatic payments made with the card. "
"With Fraud Afoot, Shield Your Wallet","Identity theft, credit card theft and other data breaches seem to be a fact of life these days. The key to weathering them is to catch the problem early and act quickly. If your credit card information is compromised, you'll most likely find out from your bank, when someone tries to use the card for purchases that just don't seem right. You should always check statements carefully for unauthorized purchases, but most credit card retailers have become good at spotting them and alerting you. In most cases, you can simply dispute the charge and the card issuer will take care of the rest. According to the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act, if you report unauthorized purchases within 60 days, you can't be held liable for more than $50, and many major credit cards have reduced that to zero. Some have higher liability claims, though, so check with your bank.  Debit cards can be vulnerable, although Visa or MasterCard require that any such cards with their brand have the same zero-liability protections as their credit cards, said Jason Oxman, chief executive of the Electronic Transactions Association, a trade group. If you have a bank debit card, you have two business days to report any unauthorized transactions if you want full protection, but you may still be liable for $50. After two days but within 60 days, you could be responsible for up to $500 in losses. And if you somehow don't notice or don't report the theft within 60 days, you're out of luck; someone could drain your bank account and you'd have no recourse. That is why it's a good idea to use a credit card when shopping online, or if you must use a debit card, use it in conjunction with something like PayPal, which adds an extra layer of fraud protection and will take responsibility for most unauthorized purchases. With identity theft fraud, someone has impersonated you and opened credit accounts in your name. If that happens, you should immediately call one of the big three credit reporting agencies in the United States -- Experian, TransUnion or Equifax -- and ask them to place a fraud alert on your credit file. The alert lasts 90 days and will prevent anyone from opening new accounts without your specific consent by phone. You have to notify only one credit bureau, and it will tell the other two. To be extra cautious, you should call all three yourself or set the alert online. Once you've confirmed the theft, it's also important to file a police report. In some cities, you can do this online as well. That report, the timeline of events and case number will be invaluable when you call banks or stores to assure them that the fraudulent accounts aren't yours. And you can use the police report to extend the fraud alert on your credit files to seven years. If thieves have opened multiple accounts in your name, you may want to enlist the help of an identity protection service like LifeLock or ProtectMyID, which is affiliated with the credit bureau Experian. If you're already in trouble, these companies will help you find unauthorized charges on your credit file, and then track down and help you call the banks and stores that may have accounts in your name. That can make it much easier to clean up the mess. You may have to be present on the calls, or fill out affidavits or other paperwork to complete your claims, but the fraud resolution agents assist you with creating dispute letters and reaching the right people.It costs $10 to $30 a month to have one of these services monitor your account information for fraudulent activity, or you can monitor your credit activity yourself for the next few months or even a year. Either way, stay vigilant for future activity. ''If you've been a victim of ID theft, the likelihood is that your data's been sold,'' said Becky Frost, a public relations manager from Experian's consumer division. ''This may be something that you deal with once and move on, but what's more likely is that you take care of the problem and then the data is sold again.'' For more extreme protection, some consumers are actually freezing their credit accounts so that credit agencies cannot release reports to anyone without explicit consent. The freeze doesn't apply to companies you currently do business with, but would stop any new accounts from getting into your credit. That means that if someone wants to open a credit card or get a loan, the credit agency will have to reach you for specific authorization, which you can grant with a personal identification number. In most states, you can place a freeze on your credit without charge if you're the victim of identity theft. (What gives, Connecticut?) Some states require a copy of a police or other identity fraud report as proof. If you just want the additional security of knowing that your credit report is locked down against identity theft, you can pay a small fee -- usually around $10 -- to freeze your credit and then pay the same amount again to thaw it. That may seem like an extreme step, but considering how often personal and financial data seems to be exposed lately, maybe extreme is the only way to feel safe. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Preparing for Chip-and-PIN Cards in the United States,"On a recent morning, eager shoppers swarmed around Covent Garden, a 350-year-old former open-air vegetable market in central London whose glass-fronted stores now include popular American companies like Apple and Shake Shack. But when consumers here pulled out a credit card to make a purchase, they got an extra layer of security compared with most shoppers in the United States. A chip embedded into all credit and debit cards in Europe - a technology known as E.M.V. - has cut many forms of card fraud by more than 65 percent in the last decade.  ""At first, it was a little strange to use, but now it's become second nature,"" said Jennifer Spencer, 39, an office manager, who was at Covent Garden to get a head start on holiday shopping. ""I can't imagine paying for things in any other way."" The technology, which has a microchip in the card and requires consumers to enter a PIN at checkout, has been required in Europe and some countries elsewhere for about a decade. Now, Americans retailers and banks are preparing for the wide release of the technology, in a wholesale security upgrade that will cost billions of dollars. The change will start next year and is expected to take several years to complete. The upgrade follows several major credit card data breaches at major retailers, including Target and Home Depot. And while security specialists say E.M.V. technology (named for Europay, MasterCard and Visa) will not stop hackers from targeting bank accounts, the new cards represent a significant improvement on how individuals' financial data is handled. The new credit and debit cards also bring the United States up to the security standards of the rest of the world. ""The U.S. is the weakest link in the payment chain,"" said Julie Conroy, research director in the retail banking unit of the Aite Group, a consulting firm in Boston. ""As card fraud has risen 30 percent annually in recent years, the business case to upgrade cards now makes sense."" In response to consumer fears about future data breaches, major American retailers and banks are moving fast to introduce cards and checkout systems before October 2015, when the cost for fraudulent transactions will shift from banks to merchants if the merchants have not upgraded their equipment. Already, retailers like Walmart and Walgreens have outlined plans to issue E.M.V. store-branded credit cards. And President Obama announced in October that cards issued by the federal government would come with encrypted microchips and four-digit codes as standard, beginning in 2015. In total, roughly 70 percent of credit cards and 40 percent of debit cards are expected to use the technology by the end of next year, though the introduction of upgraded checkout systems will not be completed until the end of the decade. ""Companies now realize that this type of fraud represents a real and present danger,"" Ms. Conroy said. The major difference between older credit cards and E.M.V. cards will be a small embedded microchip that creates an individual transaction code when the card's owner makes an in-store payment. An individual's data is now stored on a card's magnetic strip, based on technology barely changed since the 1970s, that does not alter financial information between transactions. When copied, the strip allows thieves to readily falsify a person's personal details to make illegal purchases. That is not possible with the encrypted microchip that uses individual transaction codes. The technology, often called chip-and-PIN, also uses a four-digit code to verify transactions, rather than a signature. The code must be entered to approve each purchase. When combined with the secure microchips, these numeric codes make transactions roughly 700 times as secure as older payment methods, according to the Federal Reserve. ""The main reason to use these cards is to reduce fraud,"" said Jeremy Light, a managing director for payment services at the consultancy Accenture in London. ""When you make a chip-and-PIN purchase, it gives the consumer greater control over the entire transaction."" While the technology is only starting to be introduced in the United States, most of Europe - and emerging markets like Brazil and Mexico - have relied on these highly secure cards for years. Security specialists say other parts of the world have been quicker to embrace E.M.V. cards because levels of financial fraud there were traditionally higher than those in the United States. In Britain, for example, roughly 14 cents out of every $100 was lost to card fraud in 2004 (when the technology was introduced), compared with just 5 cents in the United States, Aite said. Since the cards were adopted, British counterfeit and stolen card fraud has fallen roughly 60 percent, to $160 million, over the last decade while the same figures for the United States have jumped about 50 percent, to $3.2 billion, in the same period. Specialists warn, however, that the E.M.V. technology will not address all types of financial fraud. Although the encrypted microchips have led to a significant decline in counterfeit cards, they cannot stop illegal online purchases that do not require an individual to enter a four-digit code. Such purchases represent the fastest-growing area of financial fraud. The technology also would have not have stopped hackers from breaching companies like Target and Home Depot by gaining access to in-store cash register systems. But the microchip technology would have ensured that any data they pulled from customers' credit cards could not be used for future purchases, or to make counterfeit cards. ""Although E.M.V. on its own would not have stopped the full breach, it would have reduced the overall risk and consumer anger,"" said Gilles Ubaghs, a senior analyst at the technology research company Ovum.                       "
"The Credit Card of Tomorrow: Software, Not Plastic","SINCE the 1970s, paying with plastic has been pretty standard everywhere: Customers swiped their cards, signed receipts and took home their purchases. But after security breaches at Target late last year led to the loss of personal data from as many as 110 million customers, the financial industry is racing to adopt technologies that will alter that decades-old ritual. Driven largely by security concerns, credit card companies and issuers say they are working to make the system as consumers know it obsolete through smart chips and advanced computer programming. To many, it is about time. The roots of the magnetic strip on credit cards extend back to World War II, ample time for thieves to learn to hack and steal those black lines of prized account information.  Credit card fraud totaled nearly $5.3 billion in the United States alone in 2012, giving the industry plenty of incentive to devise a better system. The amount lost to fraud continues to grow by 30 to 50 percent a year, according to estimates from the Aite Group, a research company. Efforts to bolster card security were underway well before hackers broke into the systems of Target, Neiman Marcus, Michaels and other store chains. But the recent data breaches injected new urgency into adopting newer technology. ""I think this will become a defining moment about how we in the industry think about security,"" said Eileen Serra, the chief executive of Chase Card Services. The credit card industry, especially in the United States, has long relied on increasingly sophisticated analytical programs to weed out potentially fraudulent transactions. But it has also focused on a handful of technologies it contends will better protect customers in stores and online. One is placing microprocessors onto cards, a standard known as E.M.V. for its initial backers: Europay, MasterCard and Visa. Another is known as tokenization, a way of masking consumers' card information over the Internet. ""It's about taking vulnerable data out of the merchant environment,"" said Ellen Richey, Visa's chief legal officer. E.M.V. is the best-known technology. Such cards are embedded with smart chips authenticating that their bearers are their rightful users. The chip is also extraordinarily difficult for thieves to counterfeit. Cardholders verify the transaction with a PIN or a signature. Though the latter is less secure, it will likely be more prevalent in the United States at first, though Chase and others expect to offer chip-and-PIN cards this year. Europe and parts of Asia have already used the system for the better part of a decade, while American merchants and issuers have balked, largely because of cost. Chip-equipped cards cost an estimated $1.30 each to make, while a standard plastic card with a magnetic stripe on the back costs roughly 10 cents. Retailers, too, have been loath to update their systems to accept chip technology because of the added cost. ""E.M.V. is going to cost billions of dollars to implement in this country,"" said Shirley W. Inscoe, an analyst at the Aite Group. But research suggests that the system works. In 2005, when Britain fully phased in the E.M.V. technology, credit counterfeit card fraud was 25 percent; such fraud plummeted to 11 percent seven years later, according to the Aite Group. Visa, MasterCard and American Express all announced road maps for adopting smart chips more than a year and a half ago, with the aim of forcing most retailers and issuers to put E.M.V. in place by October 2015 in the United States. By then, the liability for any counterfeit fraud will fall on whoever has not adopted the chip technology. (Gas stations and A.T.M.s will have until 2017 to meet the new requirements.) From 17 million to 20 million chip cards have been issued in the United States, according to the Smart Card Alliance, an industry group. But that represents just 2 percent of the one billion cards in use. In many ways, the chip technology is already decades old. It has been around since the 1990s, born in an era before the Internet and widespread e-commerce. Industry officials concede that such technology would not have prevented the data breach at Target, or any sort of online fraud in which thieves obtained lists of customers' credit card numbers. Markets where E.M.V. has been adopted have shown a significant increase in Internet fraud. That is a gap that tokenization is meant to fill. The technology works behind the scenes of a digital transaction: Customers still put in their card number, but software then transforms that information into a one-time token - a randomly generated code - that is sent through the payment-processing chain. Thieves who intercept the code can do little with it without the means to unscramble the token. To many in the industry, part of the technology's appeal is that it requires less upheaval than E.M.V. Customers still put in card information as they always have. And the digital tokens are largely in the same format as traditional card numbers, but mask identifying information. ""Now you don't have personal information around the world,"" Ms. Serra said. ""With tokenization, we can keep that data much more secure."" The hope of digital tokens is that they will not be confined to any one way of paying. Websites, digital wallets and mobile devices could all use the technology, broadening its utility. ""Every device should have the same foundation,"" Ed McLaughlin, MasterCard's chief emerging payments officer, said. Still, for years token technology lacked the sort of universal standard that underpins chip cards. But in recent months, a joint venture of Visa, MasterCard, American Express and others announced a proposed framework to ensure that everyone was on the same page. At least two of the five biggest card issuers in the United States are adopting some form of tokens, Ms. Inscoe said. A framework for token systems is still being built, and meaningful adoption is years away, said Randy Vanderhoof, the executive director of the Smart Card Alliance. For now, chip cards will help eliminate the most obvious and pressing kinds of fraud. ""If your boat is leaking in multiple places, and you can't plug them all up at the same time, you plug the biggest one first,"" Mr. Vanderhoof said. Ultimately, while physical cards will remain in use for some time, many in the industry predict plastic as the primary way to pay will give way to digital wallets embedded in smartphones, tablets and other devices. MasterCard is already testing a way for Australian consumers with Samsung Galaxy S4 phones to pay using their phones. Smart chips and tokens eventually will be embedded in an array of computers, providing multiple layers of security, Mr. McLaughlin of MasterCard said. A consumer's smartphone will not only have a unique ID, it will also generate one-of-a-kind tokens for every transaction - ones that can be easily be disabled if the phone is lost or stolen. ""The mag stripe will become functionally obsolete,"" Ms. Richey of Visa said. ""Mobile will take over.""  "
Daily Report: U.S. Charges in Chinese Cyberespionage,"The tensions between the United States and China over accusations over cyberespionage have reached a new level. The Justice Department is expected to announce charges Monday against several individuals in the People's Liberation Army, accusing them of stealing trade secrets from American companies, Michael S. Schmidt of The New York Times reports.  It will be the first time the United States has charged government employees with economic espionage. The announcement will be made by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., law enforcement officials said, and documents are expected to be unsealed that name the companies that were hacked. In a separate case, the department will announce charges against several people who used a hacking software called Blackshades. The software allows hackers to remotely control a computer. Last year, American officials tried to pressure the Chinese government to stop its military from compromising American systems. The officials cited a report released by Mandiant, an American security company, as evidence that the Chinese government was behind the attacks. The report linked a unit of the Chinese Army to a vast share of attacks on American corporations and government agencies.   "
Ex-Premier Cited in Email Read at Trial on Hacking,"LONDON -- Tony Blair is the latest high-profile person to surface in the British phone hacking trial, a high-stakes criminal prosecution of shadowy practices at Rupert Murdoch's tabloid The News of the World. According to an email written by Rebekah Brooks, the former head of Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper empire, Mr. Blair, the former prime minister of Britain, offered to act as an ''unofficial adviser'' to Mr. Murdoch and to herself. Ms. Brooks is one of eight defendants in the case and is expected to give evidence for the first time on Thursday.  In an hourlong phone conversation days before Ms. Brooks's arrest in July 2011, Mr. Blair told her to ''keep strong'' and take sleeping pills, according to the email, to Mr. Murdoch's son James, in which she relayed the conversation. It was read out by the prosecution in court on Wednesday. The email to James Murdoch, dated July 11, 2011, said Mr. Blair ''is available for you, K.R.M.'' -- shorthand for the elder Mr. Murdoch's full name, Keith Rupert Murdoch -- ''and me as an unofficial adviser, but needs to be between us.'' ''It will pass,'' Mr. Blair told her, according to the email, advising her to commission an independent inquiry, ''Hutton-style.'' The 2004 Hutton report cleared the Blair government of wrongdoing over its handling of intelligence about unconventional weapons in Iraq. He even suggested the name of an outside lawyer, Ken Macdonald, ''a great and good type,'' the email read. On July 15 of that year, Ms. Brooks resigned from News International, the umbrella company covering the Murdoch newspapers in Britain, and on July 17, she was arrested. Mr. Blair's office issued a statement on Wednesday saying that he had been ''simply giving informal advice over the phone.'' ''If what he was being told by Ms. Brooks at the time was correct, and there had been no wrongdoing, then a finding to that effect by a credible inquiry would be far better than an internal and therefore less credible investigation,'' the statement said. The trial has become one of the most high-profile criminal prosecutions in recent times here. The disclosure in 2011 that journalists at The News of the World had years earlier intercepted the voice mail messages of a kidnapped teenager who was subsequently found dead caused widespread outrage in Britain. The case has since mushroomed, involving more than 160 Scotland Yard police officers and staff members and at least 1,000 likely victims from politics, sports and the media, as well as Prince William and his future wife, Kate Middleton. Mr. Murdoch shuttered the newspaper in 2011 as the scandal deepened. Ms. Brooks, 45, editor of The News of the World and The Sun before she ran News International, is accused of condoning if not encouraging such practices among journalists, of bribing at least one official, and of conspiring with her husband to hide evidence. Like all her co-defendants, she has pleaded not guilty. The case has been closely watched for how it may prompt efforts to tone down Britain's cacophonous journalism industry to avoid similar misconduct in the future. It has also been a window into the intimate ties at the top of news media and political power here. The email disclosing the ''between us'' counsel Ms. Brooks received from Mr. Blair, himself a friend of the Murdochs, was further evidence of that intimacy. Ms. Brooks, a longtime protégée of Mr. Murdoch's, has been called his ''fifth daughter'' in the British news media. She was named editor of The News of the World at 31 and ran his British newspaper business at 41. Prime Minister David Cameron was a friend and neighbor in the Oxfordshire countryside who rode her husband's horses. He and his immediate predecessor, Gordon Brown, reportedly both attended her wedding, as did Mr. Murdoch. Adding drama to the trial -- and steamy love letters to the pile of evidence -- have been revelations that Andy Coulson, her deputy editor and successor at The News of the World and more recently Mr. Cameron's chief spokesman, was also Ms. Brooks's lover of six years. "
Testimony at Hacking Trial Gives Peek Into British Tabloids,"LONDON -- When Rebekah Brooks first entered the witness box in Britain's phone hacking trial, her lawyer reminded the jury that she was not on trial for running Rupert Murdoch's tabloid newspapers. Even so, her testimony over the past two weeks has offered a rare view into the skating-on-the-edge culture of the popular press here, one that fascinates and revolts Britons in equal measure: the scavenging in lawyers' trash cans; the hidden recording devices; the six-figure sums paid for exclusive access to the mistresses of celebrities; the private jets whisking those mistresses to expensive hide-outs from the competition. Not to mention the illegal interception of mobile phone voice mail messages, which Ms. Brooks is accused of condoning when she was editor of The News of the World, the sensational weekly that Mr. Murdoch shut down because of the scandal. Like her six co-defendants in the trial, Ms. Brooks, who was later promoted to run all of Mr. Murdoch's British newspapers, denies all the charges against her, including paying a public official for information and hiding evidence from the police.  Ms. Brooks, 45, was questioned about some of the crasser highlights of her career by her own lawyer, Jonathan Laidlaw, even before prosecutors began their cross-examination on Wednesday. In 2004, when a former government minister, Clare Short, criticized the photographs of topless models that appear daily on Page 3 of another Murdoch tabloid, The Sun, Ms. Brooks, who was the editor of the paper at the time, hit back with a headline calling Ms. Short '' 'Fat, Jealous' Clare.'' Ms. Brooks also published an altered photograph combining Ms. Short's head with a topless woman's body, and sent a group of topless models to Ms. Short's home in Birmingham to sneer and jeer. Ms. Brooks took a different line in court. ''This was one where, again, the reaction of the paper -- I'm the editor, my responsibility -- was cruel and harsh,'' she told the jury. ''We did it in the heat of the moment: Keep your hands off Page 3. It was too personal.'' That incident was one of several decisions Ms. Brooks made, over 12 years as deputy editor or editor of the two tabloids, that she called mistakes in court. Others included a headline she approved about Frank Bruno, a boxer who developed mental health problems: ''Bonkers Bruno Locked Up.'' ''The speed of decisions at The Sun often cause lapses of judgment,'' Ms. Brooks said. ''I personally made lots of mistakes.'' Sometimes, she said, the mistake was in not acting aggressively enough. When a source demanded ''quite a lot of money'' for a disc containing exclusive information about British lawmakers abusing their expense accounts, Ms. Brooks said she hesitated, and the offer was snatched up by a competitor, The Daily Telegraph. The Telegraph's report touched off a major scandal in 2009 that led to several high-profile resignations of politicians. ''In terms of errors of judgment, it was quite high on my list,'' Ms. Brooks told the court. ''It was quite embarrassing that we didn't do it.'' Mostly, though, her tabloids paid -- in at least one case, as much as 150,000 pounds, or about $240,000, for a single article -- the court heard. In 1995, The News of the World tracked down the prostitute Divine Brown, who was arrested with the actor Hugh Grant in Los Angeles, and offered her £100,000, or about $160,000, for an exclusive. It then paid about £50,000 more to fly her extended family to Nevada and put them up in a desert resort to keep other journalists from finding them. When a rival reporter came too close, the whole clan was moved a second time. ''Hugh Told Me I Was His Sex Fantasy,'' the resulting headline read. The Murdoch-owned tabloids competed fiercely, even with one another, the jury heard. The Sun had the glass wall of its newsroom frosted to block the view of News of the World reporters and editors headed for the company cafeteria. Under cross-examination on Wednesday, she was asked by the prosecutor, Andrew Edis, whether as editor of either tabloid she had ever actually given her journalists the ''specific instruction, 'Do not hack phones.' '' ''No, that phrase I did not use,'' Ms. Brooks replied. Soon after she became editor of The News of the World in 2000, Ms. Brooks began a name-and-shame campaign publishing photographs and identities of sex offenders. The campaign cost the paper about £2 million, she testified, with much of the money spent trying to track down registered pedophiles. The campaign prompted a series of vigilante assaults, some of them on innocent people who resemble subjects of the newspaper's campaign. In one case, the home of a pediatrician was attacked by vigilantes who got their spelling wrong. Some articles came more cheaply. One private investigator, nicknamed Benji the Binman, would rifle through the trash cans outside lawyers' offices for scraps that could make an article. Journalists used hidden tape recorders to trip up members of the royal family, and occasionally donned intricate disguises to go undercover, the court heard. Ms. Brooks's close ties with Britain's political establishment have also been detailed at the trial. On Tuesday, the court heard that the day after news broke that the voice mail account of a kidnapped teenager had been hacked by The News of the World, Ms. Brooks received several supportive text messages, including one from the former Prime Minister Tony Blair. ''Let me know if there is anything I can do to help,'' Mr. Blair texted on July 5, 2011. ''Thinking of you.'' At one point during Ms. Brooks's testimony, her lawyer turned to the allegation that she conspired to hide evidence from the police two days before The News of the World was closed down. Asked if she had ordered her personal assistant and co-defendant, Cheryl Carter, to lie about Ms. Brooks's whereabouts on July 8, 2011, Ms. Brooks called the suggestion ridiculous. ''On 8 July I was in front of News of the World staff,'' she said. ''True to News of the World style, they had brought hidden cameras and listening devices -- it went live on Sky News,'' she said. ''I could hardly complain.'' "
Ex-Tabloid Executive Acquitted in British Phone Hacking Case,"LONDON -- She rose from being a secretary in Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper empire to running it. She called prime ministers her friends. Then she found herself in the middle of one of the most riveting trials in years, accused of illegally intercepting voice mails and other crimes, alongside her husband and her former deputy, who it turned out, was also her lover. And on Tuesday, in the latest twist in her extraordinary saga, Rebekah Brooks, the protagonist of Britain's phone hacking trial, who more than any other defendant had come to symbolize the freewheeling tabloid press and its proximity to power, was acquitted of all charges against her. Her former lover, Andy Coulson, who succeeded her as editor at the now-defunct Sunday tabloid at the heart of the hacking scandal and who later became a spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron, was found guilty of a conspiracy to intercept voice mails. Of the seven defendants in the case, Mr. Coulson was the only one to be convicted Tuesday; the jury has yet to decide on two other charges against Mr. Coulson, who faces a maximum of two years in prison for hacking, and another defendant.  That single conviction belied the outsize impact of a yearslong saga that produced parliamentary hearings, humbled Mr. Murdoch, led to a new media law and spurred a cleanup of the worst practices in tabloid newsrooms. The trial embarrassed many in Britain's media and political establishment, inducing additional political heartburn for Mr. Cameron, who on Tuesday apologized publicly for having hired Mr. Coulson as one of his top aides in 2007. Testimony in the trial revealed that former Prime Minister Tony Blair offered to act as an ''unofficial adviser'' to Ms. Brooks after she was implicated in the case. Tense and at times tawdry, the trial has also exposed in great detail the inner workings of British tabloid journalism -- the six-figure price tags paid for celebrity scoops, the scavenging in trash cans and the systematic eavesdropping on the cellphones of celebrities, sports stars, politicians, members of the royal family and others caught up in the news. Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson, both 46, were close colleagues and friends who rose from scrappy tabloid newsrooms to become members of the London elite. Part of the prosecution's case was that their relationship was so intimate that they would have shared what they knew about how their newspapers were operating, including the phone hacking. But in the jury room, their parallel careers diverged with finality. He was found to have admitted enough knowledge of what was going on that he could be convicted on at least one charge of conspiracy to intercept cellphone calls and messages. She apparently managed to convince the jury that she was sufficiently removed from it that it was possible she was unaware. When the verdict was read and Ms. Brooks was cleared of charges related to phone hacking, hiding evidence and bribing public officials for information, she appeared to be overcome by emotion and was led away by a court official. Mr. Coulson clenched his jaw, then took a deep breath and stared straight ahead. During the trial, the jury heard that Mr. Coulson commented ''brilliant'' when a journalist played him an intercepted voice mail left for the James Bond star Daniel Craig by the actress Sienna Miller. When a reporter was working on a story about Calum Best, a television celebrity, Mr. Coulson told him to ''do his phone.'' Prosecutors had presented phone data confirming widespread hacking during Mr. Coulson's editorship of News of the World from 2003 to 2007. There was far less evidence of hacking from 2000 to 2003, when Ms. Brooks was in charge. The most controversial instance of hacking, however, did occur on her watch, in 2002: News of The World intercepted the voice mail of a kidnapped teenager, Milly Dowler, who was later found dead. When The Guardian disclosed the hacking in 2011, it galvanized public outrage at unscrupulous tabloid practices and helped pave the way to the trial. During the week in question in 2002, however, Ms. Brooks was on vacation and her then-deputy, Mr. Coulson, was in charge. The prosecution failed to persuade the jury that as Mr. Coulson's boss and on-and-off lover, Ms. Brooks must have known. Roy Greenslade, a professor of journalism at City University in London, said many in Britain had expected her to be convicted. ''People will be outraged that the prosecution couldn't make a good enough case,'' he said. Ms. Brooks and her husband, Charlie, a racehorse trainer who was also acquitted of charges of hiding evidence (along with his pornography collection) from the police, left the court in a taxi without offering comment. The other people acquitted were Ms. Brooks's former personal assistant, Cheryl Carter, 50; Mark Hanna, 51, a former security director; and Stuart Kuttner, 74, a retired managing editor. The jury is still considering further charges against Mr. Coulson and Clive Goodman, 56, the former royals editor of News of the World, on charges related to paying police officers for access to royal telephone directories. At times Britain's phone-hacking scandal has felt like a badly scripted television drama, with all its barely believable turns and twists: the father-daughter-like relationship between Mr. Murdoch and Ms. Brooks; her $17.6 million severance payment from News International (since renamed News UK); a steamy love letter to Mr. Coulson that was read in court; and a tabloid-style defense strategy that featured the kind of highly personal revelations for which the tabloids Ms. Brooks once edited might have paid six figures, like the adultery and the daughter she had by a surrogate mother. ''My personal life was a bit of a car crash,'' she said in the witness stand early on. Ms. Brooks was a longtime protégée of Mr. Murdoch's and has been called his ''fifth daughter'' in the British news media. At 31, she became editor of News of the World. A decade later, she was running his British newspapers. All the while, she accumulated a glittering list of friends. Mr. Cameron, a neighbor in the Oxforsdshire countryside, rode her husband's horses. The tabloid culture revealed in the trial was one in which paying as much as $240,000 for a single article was deemed justified, if that meant beating rivals, even at other Murdoch papers, to a scoop. In one striking example, News of the World tracked down the prostitute Divine Brown, who had been arrested with the actor Hugh Grant in Los Angeles in 1995, and offered her 100,000 pounds, or about $160,000, for an exclusive. ''Hugh Told Me I Was His Sex Fantasy,'' the resulting headline read. The testimony was such that Ms. Brooks is unlikely to fully recover her reputation -- and the trial has humbled a once mighty and swaggering tabloid press, regardless of the outcome. Newspapers may become a little more boring, experts said, but at least they appear to stay within the law these days. ''The tabloids have become rather less tabloidy,'' said John Lloyd, co-founder of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. Indeed, given the economics of the industry, he suggested, these changes are unlikely to be reversed. The tabloids, Mr. Lloyd said. ''are losing power all the time.'' This may not be the end of legal action against Mr. Murdoch's News UK. More trials loom, involving 20 current or former reporters from The Sun and News of the World, accused of phone hacking and paying public officials for information. The Guardian reported Tuesday that News UK itself may be charged as a corporation, following Mr. Coulson's conviction. Mr. Murdoch and his son James, the former executive chairman of the company, might both face questioning by the police in the ''near future,'' the newspaper reported. In an internal memo to his staff on Tuesday, Mike Darcey, the current chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's News UK, urged staff members to ''hold your head high.'' ''We should all be proud of what we do here, and the way we do it,'' Mr. Darcey said. ''Our journalism is world class, and is conducted under the strictest standards of ethics and governance.'' "
"Judge Dismisses British Hacking Jury, Hung on Remaining Charges","LONDON -- It was an unspectacular denouement to Britain's spectacular phone hacking trial: The jury was dismissed Wednesday after failing to reach a verdict on two outstanding charges against Andy Coulson, a former tabloid editor who had been found guilty of conspiracy to intercept voice mail messages a day earlier. But in a last-minute moment of drama, Mr. Coulson's conviction abruptly shifted much of the attention to a former boss, Prime Minister David Cameron, who suddenly found himself in an uncomfortable public spat with the presiding judge.  On Wednesday, Judge John Saunders, who is expected to announce a sentence for Mr. Coulson next week, took the unusual step of castigating the prime minister for making a public statement about Mr. Coulson, his former spokesman, while the jury was still deliberating on two bribery charges against Mr. Coulson and Clive Goodman, a former royals editor at The News of the World, a tabloid that is now shuttered. Under attack by the opposition Labour Party for bringing a ''criminal'' into 10 Downing Street, Mr. Cameron hastily summoned television news crews for a ''full and frank'' apology on Tuesday after the hacking verdict was announced, saying that he was sorry he had hired Mr. Coulson, and that it had been a mistake to do so. He also said that before hiring Mr. Coulson in 2010, he asked Mr. Coulson about earlier allegations of phone hacking, and that Mr. Coulson denied having any knowledge of it. Judge Saunders was not shy about showing his irritation. ''I don't know whether it's been done in ignorance or been done deliberately,'' he said after seeing Mr. Cameron's statement. Briefly, it looked as if Mr. Cameron might have even been at risk of being held in contempt of court for prejudicing jurors, which could have derailed a trial that had lasted eight months and by some estimates cost 100 million pounds, or almost $170 million. Mr. Coulson's and Mr. Goodman's lawyers asked the judge on Wednesday to dismiss the jury, saying a fair trial could no longer be guaranteed. Their request was refused, but the judge said in his ruling, ''I consider that what has happened is unsatisfactory so far as justice and the rule of law are concerned.'' Judge Saunders said he had written to Mr. Cameron's private secretary. ''I asked for an explanation from the prime minister as to why he had issued his statement while the jury was still considering verdicts,'' he said. ''My sole concern is to ensure that justice is done. Politicians have other imperatives, and I understand that. Whether the political imperative was such that statements could not await all the verdicts, I leave to others to judge.'' Mr. Cameron's office insisted that the prime minister had sought legal advice. ''The prime minister was careful to make no further comment about any matters that might still be before the court,'' his office told the judge, who swiftly retorted that that explanation ''misses the point.'' ''He has now told the public, and therefore the jury, that he was given assurances by Mr. Coulson before he employed him, which turned out to be untrue,'' Judge Saunders said. ''The jury were not aware of that before, and it is a matter which is capable of affecting Mr. Coulson's credibility in their eyes.'' Later in the day, the jurors were dismissed anyway because they could not reach a verdict on charges that Mr. Coulson and Mr. Goodman had illegally paid police officers in return for in-house royal telephone directories. Prosecutors said they would announce on Monday whether they would seek a retrial. Out of eight hacking suspects the police had their sights on, five pleaded guilty before the trial. Mr. Coulson's conviction brings the number of those found guilty to six. He could face up to two years in prison. Rebekah Brooks, who edited The News of the World for three years before Mr. Coulson took over in 2003 and was once regarded as one of the most powerful people in British tabloid journalism, was acquitted of all charges on Tuesday. "
Curtain Will Rise on Dirty Laundry,"The verdicts are in, so the play can begin. Britain's National Theater announced that Richard Bean's play ''Great Britain,'' which deals with, among other things, the phone-hacking scandal that led to the demise of The News of the World, one of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, will have its premiere at the Lyttelton Theater in London on Monday, without previews, and will run until Aug.   23. The play will be directed by Nicholas Hytner, the theater's artistic director. ''Great Britain'' had been in rehearsals since April, but for legal reasons the theater decided to wait until a verdict was reached in the trial of editors and journalists involved in the scandal before committing to a start date. That came Tuesday, when Rebekah Brooks, formerly a top executive for Mr. Murdoch, was cleared of charges related to hacking, hiding evidence and bribing public officials for information. Five fellow defendants were also declared not guilty. Andy Coulson, her successor as editor in chief of The News of the World, was found guilty. The phone-hacking scandal is just one plot thread. Described on the theater's website as ''fast and furious'' and ''an anarchic satire,'' the play explores the relationship among the press, the political establishment and the police. ''One of the reasons I wanted to write this play is to show that those three institutions are essentially in bed with each other and this threatens democracy,'' Mr. Bean told The Guardian. "
News Corp. Slowly Putting Phone-Hacking Scandal Behind It,"Less than three years ago, a phone-hacking scandal at Rupert Murdoch's British newspapers was seen by some as the beginning of the end of his media empire. But the acquittal last week of Rebekah Brooks, the most senior News Corporation executive charged in the hacking case, is the latest development in an apparent recovery. After initial stumbles, the company has emerged largely unscathed. Mr. Murdoch's son James, once at the center of the scandal, has been promoted. And the splitting of Mr. Murdoch's holdings into two companies -- News Corporation and 21st Century Fox -- has been well received on Wall Street.  Some dark clouds still loom, however. Andy Coulson, a former editor of The News of the World, was convicted last week of conspiring to intercept voice mail messages. He is to be sentenced on Friday, part of a group of six former journalists and investigators potentially facing prison. Additional criminal trials, mostly connected to claims that News Corporation journalists paid public officials for information, are scheduled to begin this summer. And when those criminal trials are done, a public inquiry in Britain, led by a judge, will hold more hearings. Perhaps the biggest threats to News Corporation are the continuing investigations into the company's conduct on both sides of the Atlantic. In Britain, Scotland Yard began building a case against News Corporation in late 2012. Any resulting prosecution could name News Corporation as its subject, and would probably focus on whether negligence or collusion at its highest levels fostered criminality within newsrooms. Scotland Yard's inquiry, though, does not seem to have progressed from its initial stages. It was in that period that officers first sought to interview Mr. Murdoch and his son James. The company also turned over emails to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States that were subsequently passed to British authorities. In 2011, at the height of the scandal, the Justice Department opened an investigation into whether hacking had occurred in the United States. It is unclear where that investigation stands. News Corporation officials and the Metropolitan Police in London declined to comment on the investigations. Other challenges linger. The company has settled nearly 650 civil claims related to phone hacking, according to a News Corporation document from April obtained by The New York Times. That number has since risen to 718, according to figures provided by the company. Those that have settled -- a group that includes numerous prominent Britons -- received assurances that they would not face harassment in future. Before writing about any of them, journalists at the company's British papers must ''consult a member of the in-house legal team,'' the News Corporation document said. The costs of such settlements, as well as the legal fees covered for former employees like Ms. Brooks, could exceed $1 billion. The far larger and more profitable of Mr. Murdoch's two companies, 21st Century Fox, is paying some of those fees. ''Clearly that is a lot of money,'' said Alan Gould, an analyst at Evercore Partners. ''But Fox has a $76 billion market cap, and News Corp. has a $10 billion market cap. This is not make or break for them.'' Mr. Gould added, ''The key thing is that there was no contagion from the scandal.'' The company faced other financial setbacks. It shut down the profitable News of the World, and the scandal resulted in News Corporation's dropping its multibillion-dollar bid to take full control of the satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting. But a move hastened by the hacking scandal -- the division of News Corporation into two companies -- has been a major boon for Mr. Murdoch and his shareholders. The combined stock market value of the two companies has increased by tens of billions of dollars since the spinoff. Investors in 21st Century Fox -- a collection of lucrative film and television assets -- had been much less interested in the less profitable print holdings. The rump News Corporation, which houses the newspaper and book publishing businesses, was infused with more than $2 billion in cash, and though those businesses face headwinds, analysts say they are well managed. "
Former Editor Gets 18 Months in Phone Hacking,"LONDON -- Andy Coulson, a former senior editor in Rupert Murdoch's news empire and a onetime adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, was sentenced on Friday to 18 months in prison for his part in the phone hacking scandal that convulsed Britain's press, police and political elite and inspired calls for tighter regulation of journalists. After a trial that spanned almost eight months, Mr. Coulson was found guilty last week on a charge of conspiring to intercept phone messages. Five other defendants who, like Mr. Coulson, had denied the charges were acquitted. They included Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper subsidiary and Mr. Coulson's onetime lover.  Reporters in the courtroom on Friday said Mr. Coulson displayed no emotion when the sentence was read out. If he is given time off for good behavior, he could be paroled after serving half of his sentence. Standing alongside him in the courtroom were four other people involved in the hacking scandal who had admitted their part in the scandal earlier in the trial and who were sentenced to up to six months. Mr. Coulson, who edited Mr. Murdoch's tabloid The News of the World from 2003 to 2007, and the newspaper's former royals editor, Clive Goodman, also face a retrial on separate charges of making illegal payments to police officers in return for two royal telephone directories. Prosecutors called for the retrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict on those charges. The phone hacking scandal in Britain goes back more than a decade, when a private investigator hired by The News of the World hacked the voice mail of Milly Dowler, a teenager who had been abducted and was later found murdered, in 2002. When news of that episode broke in July 2011, a wave of public revulsion forced Mr. Murdoch to close the newspaper. Mr. Coulson, 46, had faced a maximum sentence of two years. ''Mr. Coulson has to take the major shame for the blame of phone hacking at The News of the World,'' Judge John Saunders said. ''He knew about it, he encouraged it when he should have stopped it.'' While Mr. Coulson's lawyer said no one in the news business realized that phone hacking was illegal at the time of the offenses, Judge Saunders said on Friday: ''I do not accept ignorance of the law provides any mitigation. The laws of protection are given to the rich, famous and powerful as to all.'' During the trial, prosecutors listed more than 1,900 occasions on which journalists commissioned a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, to hack into voice mail messages. A prosecutor, Andrew Edis, said the list of victims read like a ''Who's Who of Britain in the first five years of the century.'' On Friday, Mr. Mulcaire, who had carried out much of the hacking, including in the case of Milly Dowler, received a suspended prison sentence of six months. Like Mr. Goodman, the former royals editor, Mr. Mulcaire served a prison term in 2007 after a conviction for intercepting voice mail messages on the mobile phones of politicians, film stars and royal aides, including some left by Prince William. His lawyer had argued that he should not be punished twice. Two former News of the World senior journalists, Greg Miskiw and Neville Thurlbeck, were jailed on Friday for six months each, while their former colleague James Weatherup received a four-month suspended term. Mr. Coulson's time as editor of The News of the World came to an end in early 2007, when he resigned over the earlier hacking case that sent Mr. Mulcaire and Mr. Goodman to prison. Mr. Cameron, then in opposition, subsequently hired him as communications director -- a post he maintained after the election of 2010 that brought Mr. Cameron to power. As the scandal began to resurface in 2011, Mr. Coulson resigned again -- this time from his position at 10 Downing Street. Mr. Cameron has faced accusations that he showed a lack of judgment in hiring him and keeping him on. The opposition Labour Party has accused Mr. Cameron of seeking to curry favor with Mr. Murdoch by hiring Mr. Coulson, hoping to win the electoral endorsement of the Murdoch newspapers. Michael Dugher, a Labour spokesman and lawmaker, declared on Friday that ''this a damning verdict for David Cameron as well as Andy Coulson.'' ''Now, not only is trust in the prime minister's judgment deeply damaged, his government is tainted,'' Mr. Dugher said. Asked about his former aide's sentence, Mr. Cameron said on Friday that it was ''right that justice should be done and no one is above the law, which is what I have always said.'' The scandal inspired an array of investigations by Parliament, by the police and by a senior judge, Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson, whose inquiry concluded in November 2012 with a call for tighter press regulation.

"Andy Coulson, Former Murdoch Editor, Accused of Perjury","LONDON -- Adding to the legal tangle spreading from the phone hacking scandal, prosecutors in Scotland on Wednesday accused Andy Coulson, a former top editor in Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper empire, of committing perjury in a trial in 2010.  The accusations came weeks after Mr. Coulson, 46, a former senior adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for conspiring to intercept phone messages. The hacking scandal, which ensnared the political elite, the police and the press, has provoked calls for closer regulation of Britain's freewheeling newspapers. In the same eight-month trial, five other defendants who, like Mr. Coulson, had denied the charges, were acquitted. One of them was Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper subsidiary and Mr. Coulson's onetime lover. Prosecutors in London are also seeking a retrial for Mr. Coulson on separate charges of illegally acquiring royal telephone directories from police officers. The jury failed to reach a verdict on that accusation. Mr. Coulson's embroilment in the hacking scandal prompted opposition parties to criticize Mr. Cameron for showing poor judgment in hiring him and defending his work. Mr. Coulson resigned from Mr. Cameron's office in 2011. The latest charges at the High Court in Glasgow relate to testimony in 2010 at the trial of Tommy Sheridan, a Scottish lawmaker, and his wife. Mr. Coulson is accused of making false claims while under oath as a witness. The accusations relate to his knowledge of phone hacking at The News of the World, a best-selling Sunday tabloid that Mr. Murdoch ordered closed after the hacking scandal broke in 2011. Mr. Coulson was deputy editor of the newspaper from 2000 to 2003 and editor from 2003 to 2007. At an earlier and less explosive phase in the scandal, a journalist and a private investigator working for the newspaper during Mr. Coulson's editorship were jailed briefly in 2007 on charges of hacking into the voice mail of members of the British royal household. Scottish prosecutors said that Mr. Coulson had given a deposition as a witness denying that he knew that the two men were involved in phone hacking before they were arrested in 2006. The prosecutors alleged, however, that he was aware of instances of phone hacking, including one in 2002 involving a teenager, Milly Dowler, whose cellphone messages were hacked after she was abducted. She was later found murdered. The disclosure of the Dowler case in 2011 led to the resignation of Ms. Brooks as chief executive of the company that ran Mr. Murdoch's British newspapers. The Scottish prosecutors also said on Wednesday that Mr. Coulson was aware of corrupt payments made to police officers to obtain a private telephone directory compiled by the royal family. Mr. Coulson was not present in court on Wednesday and did not enter a plea. "
Clooney to Direct Film on Hacking Scandal,"LOS ANGELES -- And Rupert Murdoch thought his newspaper phone hacking scandal had faded from the headlines. Sony Pictures Entertainment, a media conglomerate that competes with Mr. Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, said on Wednesday that it would make a movie from the book ''Hack Attack: The Inside Story of How the Truth Caught Up With Rupert Murdoch,'' written by the British journalist Nick Davies.  George Clooney will direct the film. ''Hack Attack'' gives a behind-the-scenes account of Mr. Davies's reporting for The Guardian that exposed the extent of phone hacking at The News of the World, a newspaper that was part of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation until it was closed in 2011. Sony said Mr. Clooney would begin shooting the film next year. ''This has all the elements -- lying, corruption, blackmail -- at the highest levels of government by the biggest newspaper in London,'' Mr. Clooney said in a statement. ''And the fact that it's true is the best part.'' Mr. Clooney was nominated for an Oscar in 2005 for directing ''Good Night, and Good Luck,'' which looked at the CBS anchor Edward R. Murrow and McCarthyism. Michael De Luca, a senior Sony Entertainment executive, noted in a statement that Mr. Clooney was the son of a journalist, and he said that the Murdoch film ''will explore the dark side of that world, a business where all the rules of journalism are broken in the race for an easy and ever-larger payday.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Rebekah Brooks, Former British Tabloid Executive, Exploring Work in U.S.","Rebekah Brooks, a former editor of Rupert Murdoch's British tabloid newspapers who became an executive before resigning and standing trial in the phone hacking scandal, is in New York and has been meeting people at News Corporation to explore her next professional moves, the company and people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  Ms. Brooks was acquitted on phone hacking and three other charges in June after a trial that included details of an affair she had with a colleague, Andy Coulson, another former editor of The News of the World, the tabloid that was at the heart of the scandal. Mr. Coulson was convicted on a charge of conspiring to intercept phone messages and sentenced to 18 months in prison. ''She and her family are here in the United States for a visit, reconnecting with friends and meeting with businesses as she explores and considers her professional future,'' a News Corporation spokesman said in a statement on Thursday evening. News of Ms. Brooks's meetings with News Corporation were earlier reported by Capital New York. Ms. Brooks, known in Britain for her rise from secretary to tabloid kingmaker and confidante of the political elite, including Prime Minister David Cameron, has long been known as a favorite of Mr. Murdoch's. Since her trial ended, there has been speculation that she might rejoin his company, perhaps in the United States, away from the scandal that seemed to have ended her career. A person close to Ms. Brooks, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that she might also use her powerful connections to start her own enterprise. "
"Security Secrets, Dated but Real","Follow Edward Rothstein on Twitter; twitter.com/EdRothstein. ANNAPOLIS JUNCTION, Md. -- Was the National Cryptologic Museum designed using a code of some kind? Something perhaps meant, cryptically, to mask its character and significance? Something that can be deciphered only by those familiar with mysterious organizations like the Black Chamber? This is, after all, a museum created and run by the National Security Agency, a peculiar governmental body: Its existence was once scarcely acknowledged; its 1952 founding documents were once completely classified; and its finances were once buried deep in a ''black budget.'' But with Edward J. Snowden's release of stolen classified files, along with reportorial histories by James Bamford, the N.S.A. is now partly revealed; it is popularly portrayed as an agency unhampered by oversight, secretly probing every aspect of our data-saturated lives. Yet here, just down the road from that agency's black-box buildings with their thousands of workers and immense parking lots, we come upon this quaint, slightly old-fashioned, flat-topped structure that looks like a converted motel, which it is. And when you enter, instead of facing evidence of untrammeled technological power, you are greeted with a rack of informative booklets and children's activity sheets, almost as if invoking tourist brochures from the building's previous incarnation.  The quaintness continues: The first exhibit, about ''hobo communication,'' is a model-train-size diorama of a small New England town. Is ''hobo'' perhaps the code word for a data-mining project that tracks smartphones? Does it refer to a cipher machine like Enigma? No, it means what it says: When hobos used the rails to travel the country, they would scrawl warning signs to fellow travelers on walls and walkways. A jagged line meant ''barking dog here''; a circle with an X inside meant ''good place for a handout.'' Hobo code. We press buttons and see lights go on where the signs appear. Maybe there really is a bit of agency coding involved, too. Just as when it opened in 1993, this museum is the agency's only public face, so the hobo exhibit may be meant, in part, to disguise or humanize the caricature. It also sets the tone for the museum, which is stylistically dated, slightly ramshackle and cramped. But it is also thoroughly engrossing, offering a compelling survey of American cryptography. It is redacted, of course, and its content deliberately dated. You never get close to anything redolent of classified technologies or Snowden-esque controversies. And you never quite shake the feeling that maybe if you touched a wall sconce, the cabinets would pull back, revealing a cyberwarfare lab. But such fantasies quickly fade, because the material here spurs the imagination in so many other directions. These artifacts are as various and seemingly miscellaneous as the markings on an encoded document. Here, in 13,000 square feet, is a 16th-century copy of the first published book on cryptology, Johannes Trithemius's ''Polygraphiae,'' along with a cipher disc used by the Confederacy during the Civil War; children's school notebooks used by the Vietcong to cloak intelligence on fighting forces; and a heliograph, whose maneuverable mirrors were used in the First World War to flash sunbeams in Morse Code patterns. There is a portion of the United States Navy Bombe, built by the National Cash Register Company in Dayton, Ohio, in 1943: an early mechanical computer, whose tangle of wires and whirring gears were used to break the German code. There are also, remarkably, two working German Enigma machines, whose intricacies led a generation of Polish, British and American code breakers into intricate explorations, with thousands of lives at stake. You can type on them now and watch the keys light up in a code once thought unbreakable. The museum's curator, Patrick D. Weadon, noted in a conversation that the museum's unspecified budget was modest. You feel that, too. Acquisitions, donations and expanding ambitions have led to recently added displays about the Civil and Revolutionary Wars. But over all, the tight space jumbles the dense narrative so you have to unspool it as you maneuver. Yet it works. The museum's old-fashioned wall-panel style is suited to its theme. Here we see cryptology as a craft, dependent as much on insight as on technology. ''They served in silence'' reads one memorial to fallen agency employees, but in a series of displays, some silence falls away -- at least for the retired or deceased. We see portraits of brilliant linguists who could learn languages in a weekend, along with images of female and African-American analysts whose genius also allowed them to break constraining social codes. The historical examples of cryptologic invention are remarkable: During the Revolutionary War, a letter sent by the British general Sir Henry Clinton seemed to be supporting a particular military maneuver, unless you placed an hour-glass-shaped cutout, whose use was prearranged, over the page: The message showing through means just the opposite. Activities for children invite similar exercises, but this is no game. The pivotal 1942 Battle of Midway might have been lost if the United States hadn't begun to break Japan's code; the war in the Pacific could well have ended in American surrender. There is recurring emphasis here, too, on language. We begin to understand coding as an unusual form of translation: It turns sense (the message) into non-sense (the code). The job of decryption is much harder: to discern pattern in the midst of noise, meaning in seeming chaos. As we approach the present, those tasks become more and more daunting, keeping pace with the technology. We see sections of a supercomputer that was installed at the N.S.A. in 1993: the Ziegler, from Cray Research. It was, we read, ''among the most powerful supercomputers in the world.'' The piece on display weighs 7,495 pounds. It required a 60-ton refrigeration unit. And how powerful was it? Its processor speed is now dwarfed by a smartphone's. It had just 32 gigabytes of memory, and its disk storage was 142 gigabytes. I'll stick with my laptop. What happens to cryptology during 20 years of such transformation? In a gallery devoted to the evolution of intelligence satellites and secure communications, we see the changes in hardware, but it is the processing that becomes extraordinary. And that we can't see (or are not cleared to). Still, we know enough to imagine what is happening. Contemporary cryptology leaves General Clinton's cutout and the Enigma's turning discs far behind. A particular message may not even be the point any longer. The larger challenge is to identify that transmission amid noisy background chatter. And more important than any single message may be the patterns and anomalies discerned as vast quantities of data are churned. A secret in this world might be best preserved by seeming not to be a secret at all. That's the comfort I take in recent revelations about the N.S.A.'s engorgement on communications data. It may not care much about the isolated case -- the individual, say, worried about privacy. The problem is that the quantities of data are so great that anomalies are almost certain. Something may seem to have coded significance when it does not. And that would sweep even the innocent into a cryptographic world determined to discern meaning, even if, on occasion, there is none.

Big Web Crash: Experts Suspect Great Firewall,"Updated, 10:30 p.m. | SAN FRANCISCO -- The story behind what may have been the biggest Internet failure in history involves an unlikely cast of characters, including a little-known company in a drab building in Wyoming and the world's most elite army of Internet censors a continent away in China. On Tuesday, most of China's 500 million Internet users were unable to load websites for up to eight hours. Nearly every Chinese user and Internet company, including major services like Baidu and Sina.com, was affected.  Technology experts say China's own Great Firewall -- the country's vast collection of censors and snooping technology used to control Internet traffic in and out of China -- was most likely to blame, mistakenly redirecting the country's traffic to several sites normally blocked inside China, some connected to a company based in the Wyoming building. The Chinese authorities put a premium on control. Using the Great Firewall, they police the Internet to smother any hint of antigovernment sentiment, sometimes jailing dissidents and journalists; they blacklist major websites like Facebook and Twitter; and they block access to media outlets like The New York Times and Bloomberg News for unfavorable coverage of the country's leaders. But the strange story of Tuesday's downtime shows that sometimes their efforts can backfire. The China Internet Network Information Center, a state-run agency that deals with Internet affairs, said it had traced the problem to the country's domain name system. One of China's biggest antivirus software vendors, Qihoo 360 Technology, said the problems affected about three-quarters of the country's domain-name system servers. ''I have never seen a bigger outage,'' said Heiko Specht, an Internet analyst at Compuware, a technology company based in Detroit. ''Half of the world's Internet users trying to access the Internet couldn't.'' Those domain-name servers, which act like an Internet switchboard, routed traffic from some of China's most popular sites to an Internet address that, according to records, is registered to Sophidea, a company based, at least on paper, in that Wyoming building, in Cheyenne. It is unclear where the company or its servers are physically based, however. With so much Internet traffic flooding Sophidea's Internet address, Mr. Specht said he believed it would have taken less than a millisecond for the company's servers to crash. Until last year, Sophidea was based in a 1,700-square-foot brick house on a residential block of Cheyenne. The house, and its former tenant, a business called Wyoming Corporate Services, was the subject of a lengthy Reuters article in 2011 that found that about 2,000 business entities had been registered to the home. Among them were a company controlled by a jailed former Ukraine prime minister, the owner of a company charged with helping online poker operators evade online gambling bans, and one entity that was banned from government contract work after selling counterfeit truck parts to the Pentagon. Wyoming Corporate Services, which helps clients anywhere in the world create companies on paper and is designated to receive lawsuits on their behalf, moved its headquarters 10 blocks from its former base last year. Gerald Pitts, the Wyoming Corporate Services president, said in an interview on Wednesday that his company acted as the registered agent for 8,000 businesses, including Sophidea, though he did not know what the company did. Technology experts say Sophidea appears to be a service that reroutes Internet traffic from one website to another to mask a person's whereabouts, to make it easier to send spam for example -- or to evade a firewall, like the ones that Chinese censors erect. Sophidea's managers are not publicly listed. Wyoming is light on business regulation. The state requires only that companies file a short annual report disclosing assets that are physically located in Wyoming and the name of one person submitting the report. According to Wyoming state records, Sophidea's director is Mark Chen, with no associated contact information. Mr. Pitts, of Wyoming Corporate Services, said he could not provide any further information for the company without a legal order. But for less than a millisecond on Tuesday, the company's operators may have been surprised to find that a huge portion of the world's Internet traffic was firing at their servers and that their Internet address was the subject of much speculation within the Chinese media. Several Chinese newspapers named Sophidea's Internet address as the ''No. 1 suspect'' in a cyberattack. By late Tuesday, some technologists surmised that the disruption might have been caused by Chinese Internet censors who tried to block traffic to Sophidea's websites because they could be used to evade the Great Firewall and mistakenly redirected traffic to the Internet address. That theory was buttressed by the fact that a separate wave of Chinese Internet traffic Tuesday was simultaneously redirected to Internet addresses owned by Dynamic Internet Technology, a company that helps people evade China's Great Firewall, and is typically blocked in China. According to D.I.T.'s website, its clients include Epoch Times, a newspaper affiliated with the Falun Gong movement; Voice of America; Radio Free Asia; and Human Rights in China, an activist group based in New York. Bill Xia, a Falun Gong adherent who founded D.I.T. after emigrating to the United States, said in an email that the problem could have been caused by a ''misconfiguration'' in the state's firewall, which controls traffic across multiple Internet service providers in China. ''Only the Great Firewall has this capability ready,'' he said. Greatfire.org, an independent site that monitors censorship in China, echoed that theory in a blog post. One thing is certain, said Mr. Specht of Compuware: Chinese Internet users' and companies' trust in the Internet has been shaken. ''Already Chinese Internet users do not have too much trust in the Internet,'' he said. Amy Qin contributed reporting from Beijing. "
Saving Golf by Bastardizing It,"To the Sports Editor: Re ''In a Hole, Golf Considers Digging a Wider One,'' April 19: Although I consider myself a golf hacker who regards a final score below 100 as an achievement, I nevertheless read this article with horror. Making the cup the size of a dinner plate is to me just another sign of the continuing trend to make everything in life require less effort so as to achieve a satisfactory result, rather than an excellent one. My grandchildren also lower their basketball backboard so they can dunk, rather than try to improve their overall skill by keeping it at the official height. From my standpoint, all of these concessions are indicative of our overall trending toward mediocrity.  MATT KAUFMAN Monroe, N.J. To the Sports Editor: There is a certain irony in golf equipment manufacturers' crying over slow play and the lack of interest among people with no time for the game. One of the primary causes of slow play is the ridiculous expense of their own highly promoted, overpriced and unnecessary premium golf balls. Golfers are not going to leave the woods until they find them. Then they have a long discussion about where to drop from and whether to go back to the tee. Those are some of the silliest rules in golf. Just drop the ball, take your stroke and keep playing. KIM EISLER Bethesda Md. To the Sports Editor: Golf is not the only sport that has experienced a wide defection. Think back to the popularity of tennis and bowling. But did the powers that be decide to amend the rules of those games to make to easier or simpler to play? Did they make the bowling pins larger or make the tennis nets lower or the balls larger? As a golfer, I'm glad that fewer people are playing the game. It makes it easier to get tee times and speeds up play. JUDITH WEISBUCH Westwood, N.J. To the Sports Editor: A hole the size of a pizza? A mulligan on every hole? That's not golf. That's called nobody wants to take the time to learn or play a great game. Those folks should stick with video games. Please don't wander onto the fairways or greens to bother real golfers who are playing the game according to its rules. Besides, we're focused on rolling that birdie putt into that perfectly sized hole. JAMES NEUPERT Atherton, Calif. To the Sports Editor: Why stop with new rules for golf? Americans have always found low-scoring soccer boring. Let's widen the nets by 10 feet. Final scores like 9-8 should generate enough excitement and revenue to overcome the objections of purists. MICHAEL EMMER Brooklyn To the Sports Editor: I've been golfing for nearly 25 years, and I will never conquer this game. That's part of the allure. I always joke that golf, like life, is best played with low expectations. Despite the frustrations that golf presents to me, it has rewarded me many times over. I've developed good friendships through the game, enjoyed beautiful surroundings and occasionally felt a sense of accomplishment that's hard to describe. Pace of play is a problem. My female foursome often waits on men studying their putts as if they had a green jacket on the line. I'm proud that my 24-year-old nephew plays -- and much better than me. So there's hope for the future. I must admit, though, two throws out of a bunker a round just may have some merit. MARCIA REICHL CONLEY Pittsburgh "
"Tiny Tracking Bugs Lurk in Emails, but There Are Ways to Squash Them","By now you probably know that browsing the web leaves you open to tracking by Internet service providers, website operators and advertisers. But less well known is that you can be tracked simply by opening an email. Merely clicking or tapping to open a message can transmit to the sender not only that you opened it, but also where you were when you did so and on what device, among other things. The technology has been used by email marketers and Nigerian fraudsters for more than a decade. But more recently, it has become a tool used by employers, sales people, bill collectors, lawyers, political candidates, nonprofit fund-raisers and maybe also that guy you met at a bar and regrettably gave your contact information to.  Here's how it works: The sender of the email embeds a so-called web bug or pixel tracker into the content of the message or possibly inside an attached PDF, Word or PowerPoint. These bugs are 1-by-1 pixel images (tinier than tiny), which are invisible to the recipient. When the email or document is opened, the bug triggers your device to contact the sender's server and convey all sorts of information. ''What it does is lure you into an online environment and the collection that goes on there without alerting you that it's happening,'' said Ryan Calo, a professor of law at the University of Washington Law School in Seattle who specializes in privacy issues. There are some things you can do to avoid having your email activity monitored. Perhaps the easiest defense is to adjust the settings of your email program so there is no image rendering. It used to be set that way by default but last year, in a boon to marketers, Gmail made the setting an opt-out feature and many other email providers followed suit. Disabling images will sift and block images from incoming emails, including those tiny, pixel-size tracking bugs. You can click on the missing images you want to see and which ones you don't. ''A more advanced technique is to construct a personal firewall that blocks images,'' said Gerald Friedland, director of audio and multimedia research at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. Or, he said, you could simply turn off your Wi-Fi while opening and reading email messages. This, of course, assumes you aren't checking your email on your provider's website but rather using a retrieval program like Apple Mail or Outlook. And don't click on any attachment while connected, nor a link within the message, even if it's the unsubscribe button. ''The unsubscribe link is the most clicked item in emails so it's often what they use to track you,'' said H.D. Moore, a senior researcher with the Internet security consultant Rapid7. ''As soon as you click on it, they know everything about you.'' Besides when, where and on what device you opened the message, an email sender can also tell how long you looked at the message and if you opened other windows while you had the message displayed. Also transmitted is if you saved, forwarded or deleted the message, how many times you subsequently opened the message plus various details about your device's operating system and settings. Analysis of this kind of tracking data is a standard service offered by bulk email providers like Constant Contact, MailChimp or HubSpot. These companies facilitate sending emails to large mailing lists and generate tracking reports so their customers can assess how well their messages are received. ''If a business learns what email content resonates, then you'll get better content,'' said Gail Goodman, the chief executive of Constant Contact. Indeed, email marketing services argue that the tracking actually helps recipients because senders use the data to craft more relevant messages as well as to determine the best viewing format and delivery time. Sales people who track emails through services like Yesware and Tout-App say the practice allows them to call customers soon after they have opened messages, while the pitch is still fresh. Or perhaps they can conveniently bump into customers at Starbucks or drop by their office, where the sales person knows the customer just opened an email. Within the last couple of years, mobile apps like Bananatag and MailTracker have made email tracking available to just about anyone. Email tracking apps and services, whether intended for professional or personal use, can cost up to $35 a month depending on the number of emails users want tracked and the detail of the tracking data. The legality of the practice is unclear. Email trackers argue it is the same data you give away when you visit a website with cookies. Opponents say it is a matter of expectation and consent. Websites are legally required to have a privacy policy that visitors can read to understand what data is being collected. ''People don't have that same understanding when they open an email,'' said Professor Calo at the University of Washington. "
The Lesson of the Sony Hack: We Should All Jump to the Erasable Internet,"This month's news provides yet another occasion for a friendly public-service reminder to anyone who uses a digital device to say anything to anyone, ever. Don't do it. Don't email, don't text, don't update, don't send photos. At least, don't do it if you have any expectation that what you say will remain private - a sentiment that's usually taken for granted in human communication, but that we should all throw to the winds, at least until we figure out a way to completely rethink how we store and manage our digital data.  Because here's the thing about the digital world that we must remember. Nothing you say in any form mediated through digital technology - absolutely nothing at all - is guaranteed to stay private. Before you type anything, just think: How will this look when it gets out? What will Angelina Jolie think if she finds out about this? If Angelina won't like it, don't send it. Because Angelina will find out. So will the rest of the world. This might seem like an extreme, perhaps jaded response to the hack at Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has resulted in the disclosure of thousands of private documents ranging from trivial to merely embarrassing to grossly serious. The disclosures make the case for creating what I've called ""the erasable Internet."" Last year, after the stunning rise of Snapchat, an app that sends pictures and messages that disappear after the recipient receives them, I argued that we were witnessing the birth of a new attitude toward data online. Snapchat showed that saving everything - the default assumption of digital communication since its birth - wasn't the only way to navigate the digital world. ""Erasing all the digital effluvia generated by our phones and computers can be just as popular a concept as saving it,"" I argued - and if we moved toward that model, the Internet might be a more private, and less dangerous and damaging place. The Snapchat Internet is now being built. A range of start-ups across the world, including Snapchat itself, are working to create communications systems that are not based on saving as a default. Someday, perhaps someday soon, it may be possible to quickly and easily send messages that you can be fairly confident are secure. But the erasable Internet is not really here today. And we should start acting like it. Despite the increasing popularity of programs that don't store all of our data by default, almost everything we do on computers today is recorded and stored somewhere, often in places over which we don't have any control.  Even Snapchat itself has been too loose on privacy. In May, it settled charges with the Federal Trade Commission, which had accused the company of collecting more data about users than it had disclosed, and of leaving users' messages vulnerable to being captured using simple workarounds. This suggests two ways to respond to the Sony hack. First, assume everything is public. Go about your business as if all you do on a computer is vulnerable to intrusion and exposure. Second, agitate for a world in which saving is not the default. ""Everyone is so excited about the cloud, but the cloud is really a drunken Xerox machine making copies of pretty much everything that everyone has said anywhere and spewing it all over the place,"" said Howard Lerman, the co-creator of Confide, a messaging app that works like the corporate version of Snapchat. Messages on Confide are deleted as soon as they are read. The app even includes a clever user-interface trick that requires scrolling a finger across the screen to read text, a measure that reduces the chance of someone capturing and distributing a screen image of a message. According to Mr. Lerman and his partner, Jon Brod, the Sony hack has prompted a surge of interest in Confide. ""This was our biggest week ever,"" Mr. Lerman said. He sees Confide as a replacement for the business phone call. ""For you to be truly secure, the stuff that you say shouldn't be lying around in places you have no control over,"" Mr. Lerman said. ""It used to be, 20 years ago, that the stuff you said in a conversation would be gone. That's not true anymore."" But the problem with Confide, Snapchat and every other ephemeral app is that not everyone uses them. To communicate with much of the world today, we've got to rely on insecure systems like email. That means we've got to remember to watch what we say and how we say it. It's a telling point that one victim in the Sony hack was Snapchat itself, whose secret business dealings were uncovered. In an email to employees after the hack- an email he later tweeted - Evan Spiegel, Snapchat's chief executive, wrote that he was saddened and angered by the hack, but that it underscored the urgency of Snapchat's vision for the future of online life. The central motivation of that vision, he wrote, was to bring a measure of secrecy back into our social lives. Secrets ""bring us together,"" Mr. Spiegel wrote, launching into an elegiac defense of privacy. He added: ""It's not O.K. that people steal our secrets and make public that which we desire to remain private."" I downloaded Confide today, and I'm on Snapchat. I hope you will be, too. "
China Criticizes U.S. Government Curbs on Foreign Technology Purchases,"BEIJING -- China's Commerce Ministry has condemned a $1.1 trillion spending bill passed by the United States Congress last week over clauses that limit technological purchases from China, saying the limits clash with the principles of fair trade.  The bill, signed by President Obama on Friday, included a cyberespionage review process for federal purchases of technology from China, a provision incorporated last year as concern grew in the United States about Chinese cyberattacks. In a weekend statement, the Commerce Ministry said the move ''went against the principles of fair trade'' in seeking to curb purchases of Chinese technology and the exporting of satellites and parts to China. ''China is resolutely opposed,'' the ministry said in comments attributed to an unnamed official in its United States trade division. The comments added that bill sent the wrong message, did not aid exchanges and cooperation in high technology and would harm both Chinese companies and American ones. ''We have noted that U.S. business groups have already made noises opposing the bill,'' the statement said. ''The U.S. side should correct its mistaken ways, and create good conditions for the healthy development of Sino-U.S. trade and business cooperation.'' The legislation bars the American space agency NASA and the Justice and Commerce Departments from buying information technology systems without the approval of federal law enforcement officials. That approval must take into account ''any risk associated with such system being produced, manufactured or assembled by one or more entities that are owned, directed or subsidized'' by China, it says. Representative Frank Wolf, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee, said he directed the language to be included last year because of concerns about potential cyberthreats from Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE. Mr. Wolf cited a 2012 congressional intelligence report that found such companies were closely connected to China's army, which coordinates cyberespionage against the United States. ''A slightly modified version of this language was continued again this year by bipartisan agreement with the Senate, and I believe it should be maintained and expanded to all civilian federal agencies in the year ahead,'' Mr. Wolf said in a news release. United States curbs on foreign access to satellite technology since 1999 have effectively banned the export, re-export or transfer of this equipment or expertise to China. The restriction followed a 1996 Chinese rocket launching accident that destroyed a satellite manufactured in the United States. "
Germany: Hacker Group Says Officials Aided Allies' Spying,"MUNICH -- The Chaos Computer Club, a leading hacker organization based in Germany, filed a criminal complaint against Chancellor Angela Merkel and members of her government on Monday, accusing them of violating the law by helping intelligence agencies in the United States and Britain to spy on German citizens.  The move comes days after Secretary of State John Kerry visited Berlin to try to smooth over relations that have been strained by revelations of the extent of the National Security Agency's surveillance activities in Germany. While filing the complaint with the Federal Prosecutor General is only a first step in the cumbersome German legal process and does not guarantee that an investigation will be opened, it demonstrates unwillingness by some here to drop the issue. Along with the International League for Human Rights, based in New York, the 32-year-old hacker group said in the complaint that Ms. Merkel's government and German intelligence agencies violated the personal privacy of German citizens through ''illegal and prohibited covert intelligence activities, along with aiding and abetting such activities'' by tolerating and cooperating with the N.S.A. and the British eavesdropping agency, known as GCHQ. ''Every German citizen has been affected by the massive surveillance of his or her communication data,'' Julius Mittenzwei, a lawyer and member of the hacker group, said in a statement issued by the Chaos Computer Club. ''Our laws protect us and threaten anyone responsible for such surveillance with punishment. Consequently, an investigation by the Federal Prosecutor General is necessary and mandatory by law.'' Ms. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said that every German citizen had the right to file such a complaint, but declined to comment further. Germany's debate of the N.S.A. has focused heavily on the extent to which the agency might have broken the law by carrying out surveillance in Germany. Information from documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the fugitive former contractor for the agency, indicating that the chancellor's cellphone had been monitored and that surveillance was being conducted from the United States Embassy in the heart of the city, helped fuel the debate. But in an interview with Hubert Seipel, a reporter for the German public television station NDR, Mr. Snowden described the relationship between Germany's foreign intelligence service, known by the initials BND, and the N.S.A. as ''intimate.'' ''They not only share information, the reporting of results from intelligence, but they actually share the tools and the infrastructure,'' Mr. Snowden said. But he declined to say whether the German service was giving data to the N.S.A. The Germans have sought unsuccessfully to draw up a ''no-spying'' agreement with Washington. During a visit to Berlin on Friday, Mr. Kerry did not mention the surveillance issue, focusing instead on the importance of the relationship between the two countries. ''We want this to be a year of renewal of the strength of that relationship,'' Mr. Kerry said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
British Man Faces Charges of Hacking Fed Computers,"A British man has been charged with hacking into computer servers belonging to the United States Federal Reserve, and then widely disclosing personal information of people who use them. Thursday's charges against Lauri Love were announced four months after he was arrested in England, and accused by United States and British authorities of hacking into various American government computer systems, including those run by the military.  According to the latest indictment, Mr. Love, who is in his late 20s, worked with other hackers from October 2012 to February 2013 to infiltrate the Federal Reserve's system. The Suffolk resident allegedly used a hacking method called a ''sequel injection'' to access names, email addresses and phone numbers, and then post the stolen information to a website he controlled after a prior hacking. Prosecutors said Mr. Love boasted about his activity in a chatroom under names such as ''peace'' and ''Smedley Butler,'' once saying he planned to ''drop another little federal reserve bomb,'' meaning he would disclose confidential information. ''Lauri Love is a sophisticated hacker,'' said Preet Bharara, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a statement. ''We place a high priority on the investigation and prosecution of hackers who intrude into our infrastructure and threaten the personal security of our citizens.'' The extent of the theft was not immediately clear. Last February, the Fed said one of its internal websites had been breached briefly, after a claim that hackers linked to the group Anonymous stole and published personal information on more than 4,000 American bank executives. Thursday's grand jury indictment charges Love with one count each of computer hacking and aggravated identity theft. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison on the hacking charge and another two years on the identity theft charge, if convicted. A lawyer for Mr. Love could not immediately be reached. Jim Strader, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., declined to elaborate on the new charges. Britain's Serious Frauds Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In the earlier case, investigators said Mr. Love and three unnamed co-conspirators, including two in Australia and one in Sweden, infiltrated thousands of systems, including those of the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency. Criminal charges in that case were filed with the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Love has not entered a plea. The New York case is U.S. v. Love, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-cr-00126. The Virginia case is U.S. v. Love, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, No. 13-mj-00657. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Has Privacy Become a Luxury Good?,"Julia Angwin is a senior reporter at ProPublica and the author of ''Dragnet Nation: A Quest for Privacy, Security, and Freedom in a World of Relentless Surveillance.'' LAST year, I spent more than $2,200 and countless hours trying to protect my privacy. Some of the items I bought -- a $230 service that encrypted my data in the Internet cloud; a $35 privacy filter to shield my laptop screen from coffee-shop voyeurs; and a $420 subscription to a portable Internet service to bypass untrusted connections -- protect me from criminals and hackers. Other products, like a $5-a-month service that provides me with disposable email addresses and phone numbers, protect me against the legal (but, to me, unfair) mining and sale of my personal data. In our data-saturated economy, privacy is becoming a luxury good. After all, as the saying goes, if you aren't paying for the product, you are the product. And currently, we aren't paying for very much of our technology.  Not long ago, we would have bought services as important to us as mail and news. Now, however, we get all those services for free -- and we pay with our personal data, which is spliced and diced and bought and sold. Consider Google, which scans what you write in Gmail to offer advertisers a chance to promote their items based on your missives. Or a visit to an online news site where your data is secretly auctioned and sold before the page loads. Or Facebook, which allows marketers to turn your status updates into ads for their products. Those who aren't bothered by that exchange should keep in mind that our data is used not just for advertisements. It has also been used to charge people different prices based on their personal information. It has been used to provide different search results to different people based on their political interests. It has been used by the government to identify possible criminal and terrorist suspects. Just last week, we learned that the British government had intercepted and archived still images from millions of Yahoo webcam chats around the world, whether or not the participants were suspected of wrongdoing. The more we learn about how our data is being harnessed -- and how it may be exploited in the future -- the more likely we are to re-evaluate the true cost of these supposedly free services. And some of us will start trying to buy our way out of the trade-your-data-for-services economy. But, as I have learned, it isn't cheap or convenient to start buying privacy. I spend annoying amounts of time updating software or trying to resolve technical difficulties when my different privacy-protecting services conflict with one another. It all reminds me of the early days of the organic food movement, when buying organic often meant trekking to inconveniently located, odd-smelling stores and paying high rates for misshapen apples. Only the devoted few were willing to suffer the hassles. Over time, however, the number of people worried about chemicals in their food grew large enough to support a robust market. The stores eventually became better looking, the apples were less misshapen, and organic food entered the mainstream of American life. A similar evolution in the personal-data-protection market is underway. Traffic to the privacy-protecting search engine DuckDuckGo has more than doubled since Edward J. Snowden revealed vast government surveillance programs last June. The Blackphone, a $629 not-yet-released Android-based smartphone that will have privacy-protecting software installed to allow users to send encrypted texts and make encrypted calls, is being pre-ordered by the thousands. And last year, a New York entrepreneur, Adam Harvey, sold out of his first run of the OFF Pocket -- an $85 cellphone case that blocks signals to and from the phone. ''My vision is that privacy won't be given to you as a law completely,'' he told me. ''You have to commercialize it so people can speak with their money.'' Standing in the way of the widespread adoption of these tools, however, is the problem of verification. I have Mr. Harvey's OFF Pocket and it seems to block the cell signals, but I don't know for sure that it works as promised. The same is true with the Blackphone, or DuckDuckGo's privacy policies. I hope their claims are true, but there are few trusted third parties to verify them. This was brought home to me when I signed up for a service from TrustedID. For $35, the company promised to opt me out of some of the biggest American data brokers. A few months later, I contacted those brokers to confirm that my information had been removed from their databases. It turned out that TrustedID had failed to process more than half of the opt-outs. The service has since been suspended. As more privacy-protecting services pop up, we need to consider two important questions: Can we ensure that those who can afford to buy privacy services are not being deceived? And even more important, do we want privacy to be something that only those with disposable money and time can afford? The food industry can offer some possible answers to those questions. Our government enforces baseline standards for the safety of all food and has strict production and labeling requirements for organic food. It may be time to start doing the same for our data. "
Online Map Tracks Frauds Against the Old,"David Burdette, a retired executive in Concord, N.H., narrowly missed becoming a victim of financial fraud last summer after criminals were apparently able to crack the password to an online account that he used to manage his telephone service. Mr. Burdette, 63, said it took months to change various account numbers and reset passwords after the episode, which left him wary of the perils of the Internet. ''My level of paranoia has certainly increased,'' he said.  Alerting consumers to fraudulent schemes targeting older Americans is the goal of a new interactive Fraud Watch Network map created by the advocacy group AARP. The national map, which became available this week, follows creation of the group's fraud awareness campaign last fall. The goal is to help consumers more easily track illegal schemes that target them for financial fraud and identity theft, said Nancy LeaMond, executive vice president at AARP. ''It's to make sure that people are alerted to scams that are out there,'' she said. The online map lets you click on your state and see notices about fraudulent activity in your area, both from consumers reporting their personal experiences and from state authorities. Arizona's attorney general, for instance, warns of ''medical alert'' scams that are now circulating in several regions, targeting older people in particular. Reports on the map include one from a woman in Tennessee who received emails telling her she was about to be evicted, and asking her to click on an attachment. Another in Texas learned that someone had created an online Social Security account in her mother's name, and had redirected her monthly payment to another account. Older Americans are increasingly using the Internet. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, 56 percent of Americans aged 65 and older are online, and more than half of those who are online use social network sites. That means schemes targeting older people, and the services they use, also are moving online. ''The Internet is providing another opportunity for people to be scammed,'' said Maggie Flowers, senior program manager at the National Council on Aging. Older Americans may be attractive targets because they have accumulated nest eggs for retirement, or have substantial equity built up in their homes. ''They have access to resources and funds they've saved for their whole lives,'' said Nora Eisenhower, assistant director at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Office for Older Americans. ''You're a target because you've lived a fiscally responsible life.'' In Mr. Burdette's case, he learned that he was nearly a victim when he got a call from his bank, asking if he had authorized a transfer of funds to an overseas account. He hadn't, so the transfer was canceled. But it had been a close call, he learned. Before the criminals contacted his bank to request the transfer, they used their online access to his telephone account to activate a feature that lets customers forward calls to another phone number. When the bank initially called to verify the transaction, the call went to the criminal's telephone number, instead of to Mr. Burdette. The scheme was thwarted when a suspicious bank employee contacted Mr. Burdette on another telephone number. Mr. Burdette said he was considering becoming a volunteer with AARP to help advise others about avoiding fraud and staying secure online. While he still is not sure how the criminals obtained his bank account number, he said he realized that his online password should have been stronger. ''People need to pay attention to what they're using for passwords, and they shouldn't use the same one for multiple vendors,'' he said. Here are some additional questions about online fraud: â-  How can I help an older relative stay safe online? Advise that person not to open emails or attachments from unknown senders, and to avoid clicking on ''pop up'' alerts, which may actually be a way for malicious software to make its way onto the computer. People who are under stress from events in their life -- like illness, a job loss or the death of a loved one -- should be particularly cautious about responding to unsolicited offers or inquiries, said Ms. LeaMond of AARP. â-  How can I choose a safe password? Passwords should be at least eight characters long and contain both upper- and lowercase letters as well as numbers and symbols. If the password must be written down, security experts recommend that it be kept in a safe place -- and ideally, not labeled a password. â-  Where can I go for help, if I think I've encountered a scam? You can complain to the consumer bureau of your state attorney general's office; a list by state is available at the National Association of Attorneys General. The National Council on Aging lists tips for avoiding fraud, and you can file a complaint about a financial service with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Stop Glorifying Hackers,"The author of ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama: The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution.'' I WAS at the Museum of Modern Art in New York not long ago, soaking in Edward Hopper's retro downer mystique, when I got a call that opened up brave new all-night-diners of doom and gloom. The editor of thesmokinggun.com, a website that publishes embarrassing documents with headlines like ''Man Jailed for Toilet Seat Attack on Disabled Kin,'' had come into some documents of mine, including my Social Security number with birth date, a photograph of me assailing a moth infestation in an elderly friend's kitchen and nearly all my passwords.  The conduit of the purloined goods was Guccifer, a hacker made famous last year for liberating George W. Bush's post-presidential self-portraits from his sister's email. Colin Powell's Facebook page was also defaced, but plenty of people with no state secrets got caught in his net (apparently he got to me while hacking the email of my friend Sidney Blumenthal, the Clinton family consigliere). Yet in January, when Romanian authorities arrested Marcel Lazar Lehel, the 40-something citizen thought to be Guccifer, the world did not seem to share my relief. Instead of being called out as the Grim Reaper of privacy, Mr. Lehel got mostly attaboys. Guccifer is ''to hacking what the Beatles are to rock and roll,'' wrote New York magazine. A commenter on Gawker suggested a legal defense fund. Given that private citizens as well as celebrities (Candace Bushnell, Tina Brown) have been undressed by him, where is the alarm that anyone's online dossier could be called for no particular reason -- unless you have total control over not just your own cyber-presence, but that of your lawyer, your financial adviser, your therapist, your children's teachers, your spouse, paramour, bookie and bail bondsman? Partly, of course, the seeming indifference is resignation -- the fragility of our privacy is well established. But it also stems from pride, reflecting the extent to which our ''devices'' have become stand-ins for our egos. Consider the assumption in early media accounts that Guccifer was fooling only with ''geezer'' servers like EarthLink, Yahoo and AOL. If you were so gauche as to use what one New York magazine writer called ''a second-tier e-mail account,'' then you basically had it coming. This is wishful thinking. Although my (inactive) EarthLink account was hacked, so was my primary address, Gmail. More troubling, ''the system'' seemed to have worked. Within 24 hours I had received anodyne alerts from Google and EarthLink and -- not suspecting anything criminal -- reset both my passwords. I would not learn for nine months that within my short, oblivious interval of defenselessness Guccifer had managed to capture a passwords list I had Gmailed to myself at the office. But unlike the unfortunate insurance executive whose divorce records Guccifer released, at least I had conducted my own correspondence with the matrimonial bar on an old EarthLink server, before we parked our business on Gmail's platform indefinitely. That said, I hold less antipathy for Guccifer than for the gatekeepers who give us a false impression that our digital homes are protected and encourage us to cram in ever more precious assets. But when the locks are picked with abandon, there is no accountability. EarthLink initially made a very pleasant security expert available to me. But once I began bearing down on the company's duty to issue stronger hacking warnings or conduct follow-ups to possible intrusions, the corporate veil of boilerplate descended. Google simply directed me to a link suggesting that password theft was the fault of consumers being gulled out of their account information by phishing spammers. And even in the wake of its recent mass hacking, Yahoo likewise continues to push that argument of user fallibility. The advice I got from the nice EarthLink engineer, Rich Gardner, was instructive: Keep your personal data on a thumb drive, in a safe. That new normal explains why I wouldn't have dreamed of writing about Guccifer until after his arrest was announced. Believe me, Mr. Guccifer -- and all your friends -- far be it from me to provoke you into really strutting your stuff! But even still I hesitated, given the risk, as Mr. Gardner put it, of ''painting a target'' on my back. The realization that I was falling into totalitarian thinking convinced me I had no choice. For in the vacuum of fearful silence, crimes like Guccifer's begin to resemble principled dissent. The cult of the hacker is the tech-age update of America's long romance with the outlaw; hence an emerging narrative that casts Guccifer as sort of a Sundance Kid to Edward Snowden's Butch Cassidy -- or, per New York magazine, the hacker's ''Graydon Carter, the host of a fabulous, scandalous party,'' to Mr. Snowden's ''geek crusader.'' Being mugged by Guccifer recalled the sense of revelation I had on a visit to Tombstone, Ariz.: that a setting enshrined on grainy black-and-white film was in reality stained with the blood of actual men. The shootout at Tombstone's O.K. Corral was a mythic episode in a struggle now gone global, of rogues (those aggrieved ranchers) raging against the state-backed elite, represented by Wyatt Earp. The United States surely marshaled its finest in pursuit of a bandit who pulled off security breaches against two former presidents, former and sitting secretaries of state, a senator and a variety of intelligence officials. Yet for a year the world's most exhaustive electronic surveillance dragnet came up short against a cyber-insurgent so brazen that he was allegedly hacking the head of his own country's domestic intelligence -- while serving a suspended three-year sentence for hacking. For us civilians, with no choice but to wander into the digital crossfire, it becomes increasingly hard to know who, if anyone, wears the white hat. "
The C.I.A. Torture Cover-Up,"It was outrageous enough when two successive presidents papered over the Central Intelligence Agency's history of illegal detention, rendition, torture and fruitless harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects. Now the leader of the Senate intelligence committee, Dianne Feinstein, has provided stark and convincing evidence that the C.I.A. may have committed crimes to prevent the exposure of interrogations that she said were ''far different and far more harsh'' than anything the agency had described to Congress. Ms. Feinstein delivered an extraordinary speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday in which she said the C.I.A. improperly searched the computers used by committee staff members who were investigating the interrogation program as recently as January.  Beyond the power of her office and long experience, Ms. Feinstein's accusations carry an additional weight and credibility because she has been a reliable supporter of the intelligence agencies and their expanded powers since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 (sometimes too reliable). On Tuesday, the C.I.A. director, John Brennan, denied hacking into the committee's computers. But Ms. Feinstein said that in January, Mr. Brennan acknowledged that the agency had conducted a ''search'' of the computers. She said the C.I.A.'s inspector general had referred the matter to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution. ''Besides the constitutional implications,'' of separation of powers, she said, ''the C.I.A.'s search may also have violated the Fourth Amendment, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as Executive Order 12333, which prohibits the C.I.A. from conducting domestic searches or surveillance.'' Ms. Feinstein's speech detailed the lengths to which the C.I.A. had gone to hinder the committee's investigation, which it began in 2009 after senators learned the agency had destroyed videotapes of the interrogations under President George W. Bush. Under President Obama, prosecutors exonerated the officials who ordered those tapes destroyed. Ms. Feinstein said that when Senate staff members reviewed thousands of documents describing those interrogations in 2009, they found that the C.I.A.'s leadership seriously misled the committee when it described the interrogations program to the panel in 2006, ''only hours before President Bush disclosed the program to the public.'' The interrogations included a variety of brutal methods, some of which -- waterboarding in particular -- were unequivocally torture. When the Senate staff compiled a still undisclosed 6,300-page report, it described these acts and also concluded that the C.I.A. had falsely claimed that torture and other brutality produced useful intelligence. The report has been going through the snail's pace review and declassification process since December 2012. The C.I.A. disputed some of its findings. But Ms. Feinstein publicly confirmed on Tuesday that an internal review by the C.I.A. had reached conclusions similar to those in the Senate staff report. It was the committee staff's possession of that internal review -- which the C.I.A. has refused to give to the Senate -- that spurred what Ms. Feinstein said was an illegal search of computers (provided to the Senate staff by the C.I.A.) that contained drafts of the internal review. Ms. Feinstein said that staff members found the drafts among the documents that the C.I.A. had made available to the committee. She said she did not know whether the drafts were put there inadvertently, or by a whistle-blower. The Senate's possession of the documents was entirely legal, she said. She dismissed the acting C.I.A. general counsel's claim that the Senate staffers had hacked agency computers as intimidation. The counsel, she noted, was a lawyer and then chief lawyer for the interrogations division and is ''mentioned by name more than 1,600 times in our study.'' The Justice Department now has a criminal investigation to conduct, but the C.I.A. internal review and the Senate report must be released. Ms. Feinstein called on President Obama to make public the Senate report, which he has supported doing in the past. She said that this would ''ensure that an un-American, brutal program of detention and interrogation will never again be considered or permitted.'' The lingering fog about the C.I.A. detentions is a result of Mr. Obama's decision when he took office to conduct no investigation of them. We can only hope he knows that when he has lost Dianne Feinstein, he has no choice but to act in favor of disclosure and accountability. "
The Spies Who Didn't Love Her,"Thomas L. Friedman is off today. WASHINGTON -- Even ''Homeland'' never thought of a plot this wild. The C.I.A. hacks into computers that Senate intelligence committee staffers are using in the basement of a C.I.A. facility because the spy agency thinks its Congressional overseers have hacked into the C.I.A. network to purloin hidden documents on torture. It puts a whole new tech twist on the question from Juvenal's ''Satires:'' Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Who will guard the guards themselves? The Obama administration was caught off guard by Vladimir Putin's power grab in Ukraine. Was the C.I.A. too busy spying on the Senate to spy on Russia?  In his mad odyssey through the dark side -- waterboarding, secret rendition, indefinite detention, unnecessary war and manipulation of C.I.A. analysis -- Dick Cheney did his best to vitiate our system of checks and balances. His nefarious work is still warping our intelligence system more than a decade later. Barack Obama, the former Constitutional law teacher who became president vowing to clean up the excesses and Constitutional corrosion of W. and Cheney, will now have to clean up the excesses and Constitutional corrosion in his own administration. And he'd better get out from between two ferns and get in between the warring Congressional Democrats and administration officials -- all opening criminal investigations of each other -- because it looks as if the C.I.A. is continuing to run amok to cover up what happened in the years W. and Vice encouraged it to run amok. Langley needs a come-to-Jesus moment -- pronto. That was clear Tuesday morning when Senator Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee, suddenly materialized on the Senate floor to ''reluctantly'' out the C.I.A. It was an astonishing ''J'accuse'' moment because Feinstein has been the bulwark protecting the intelligence community against critics worried that we've become a surveillance state, ''the privacy people,'' as she has called them. But she saw things differently when she was the victim of government spying. She suggested that the C.I.A. had violated federal law and wondered ''whether our work can be thwarted by those we oversee.'' She said her staff, after dealing with C.I.A. obstructionism and an unwieldy document dump while trying to get the truth about the agency's detention and torture programs, somehow got access in 2010 to a review conducted under former C.I.A. Chief Leon Panetta, which she said acknowledged ''significant C.I.A. wrongdoing.'' She asserted that committee staff used a search tool provided by the C.I.A. and did not hack into the agency's computers, wondering if they could have been helped by a whistle-blower. But, soon enough, the Panetta review -- along with about 920 other documents -- began vanishing from Senate computers. Feinstein said that on Jan. 15, John Brennan, the C.I.A. director, came to the Hill to tell her and Vice Chairman Saxby Chambliss that C.I.A. personnel had arbitrarily conducted a ''search'' of her committee's computers, worried that the Senate had improperly gotten access to the Panetta review. In June, Brennan had issued a 122-page classified rebuttal to the still-classified $40 million, 6,300-page Senate report. But Feinstein said on the floor that she found the C.I.A. riposte ''puzzling,'' given that the Panetta internal review admitted to what the C.I.A.'s rebuttal objected to. Given the C.I.A.'s 2005 destruction of videotapes showing the torture of two Al Qaeda operatives, Feinstein said she has now locked up in the committee vault in the Hart Office Building the parts of the Panetta review that her staff had printed out before it disappeared. She has also requested in writing that Brennan turn over a complete version of the review to the committee. She said she has received no answers from Brennan, who is no fan of Congress or the media, to her formal questions about the agency's actions and no response to her request for an apology. She was clearly appalled by the nerve of the agency's acting general counsel, Robert Eatinger, in making a criminal referral to the Justice Department suggesting her staff is guilty of wrongdoing. She noted that Eatinger, whom she identified only by job title, worked in the Bush administration as a lawyer in the C.I.A.'s counterterrorism center, which carried out the notorious detention and interrogation program. She observed archly that Eatinger's name was cited more than 1,600 times in the Senate report. In 2007, The Times's Mark Mazzetti and Scott Shane reported that when a C.I.A. official trashed those interrogation videotapes, he told superiors that two C.I.A. lawyers had signed off on it. One was Eatinger. In a Q. & A. at the Council on Foreign Relations just after Feinstein's floor speech, Brennan told Andrea Mitchell that he is in no way trying to ''thwart'' the Senate. He denied that the C.I.A. hacked into Senate computers, noting that it was beyond ''the scope of reason in terms of what we would do.'' But is anything beyond the scope of reason for the C.I.A. anymore? Shouldn't someone have gone to jail now besides the guy who blew the whistle on waterboarding? It's typical that Langley, which has bungled so much for decades, couldn't even spy on the Senate properly without getting caught. "
"SOPA Defeat Haunts Efforts to Rein In Illegal Copying, British Official Says","''It's going to be five years before anybody puts his head above the parapet again.'' That's how Michael Weatherly, a member of the British Parliament and intellectual property adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron handicapped the prospects for a fresh legislative push against online piracy in the United States.  Following the defeat in 2012 of the Stop Online Piracy Act, movie companies and other advocates for copyright owners both here and in Britain have been pointed toward voluntarism. That has meant, among other things, agreements under which Internet service providers send escalating warnings to those who are believed to be downloading copyrighted material illegally. But at a news briefing in Los Angeles on Wednesday, Mr. Weatherly, a plainspoken type, also talked of escalating pressure -- legal and otherwise -- on those who advertise on sites where illegal downloading is taking place. ''There are some laws in place, but we might need to beef up a couple of them a bit more,'' suggested Mr. Weatherly, who spoke of an effort to ''strangle the advertising revenue from the illegal sites.'' Mr. Weatherly was in Los Angeles to meet with entertainment executives, with a particular eye toward cloning an American version of his favorite anti-piracy enterprise. That is a government-sponsored competition, called ''Rock the House,'' which gives prizes to young musicians, while drilling them with a message: You'll never have a career in entertainment if your audience keeps stealing the goods. But the educational message was only one side of a dual approach that finds Mr. Weatherly pushing for a tougher kind of engagement with the legal adjuncts to illegal sites. The word ''Google'' kept coming up in his talk and in reporters' questions. Mr. Weatherly said Google should be credited for a new openness toward steps to curb piracy. Only days ago, he said, Google's British executives asked him to organize a summit with entertainment executives and others in Britain, to get a grip on complaints. "
A Switch to Fight Phone Theft,"To combat phone theft, several lawmakers over the last year have put pressure on manufacturers and wireless carriers to include smarter antitheft technology on smartphones. A group of tech and phone companies on Tuesday said they were on board with the idea. CTIA, the industry trade group that represents the carriers, said over a dozen companies, including Apple, AT&T, Google, Samsung Electronics and Verizon Wireless, had committed to offering free antitheft software for cellphones at the beginning of next year.  The software would allow consumers to lock down a phone after the device has been reported stolen and reactivate it only with the correct password or personal identification number. Lawmakers like George Gascón, San Francisco's district attorney, have called this type of technology a ''kill switch.'' Still, Mr. Gascón and Eric T. Schneiderman, New York's attorney general, on Tuesday released a joint statement saying the trade group's commitment was not a complete solution. They said the issue that remained with the group's proposal was that the kill-switch would not necessarily be enabled by default on the phone, meaning criminals may still target smartphones in hopes that some consumers did not have the antitheft technology turned on. Several antitheft technologies, some of them free, already exist on the market that people can download. In their statement, Mr. Gascón and Mr. Schneiderman said: ''While CTIA's decision to respond to our call for action by announcing a new voluntary commitment to make theft-deterrent features available on smartphones is a welcome step forward, it falls short of what is needed to effectively end the epidemic of smartphone theft.'' CTIA's position is a shift, as it had initially opposed a so-called kill switch. In a filing to the Federal Communications Commission last year, the group said that a kill switch would pose risks, because hackers who took control of the feature could disable phones for customers, including the phones used by officials in the Defense Department and in law enforcement. Steve Largent, chief executive of CTIA, said in his statement on Tuesday that it was important to offer various antitheft technologies so that hackers and criminals could not easily find a ''trap door'' to disable people's phones. ''We appreciate the commitment made by these companies to protect wireless users in the event their smartphones are lost or stolen,'' he said. ''This flexibility provides consumers with access to the best features and apps that fit their unique needs while protecting their smartphones and the valuable information they contain.'' Some lawmakers are still pushing for a kill switch to be included on all smartphones. State Senator Mark Leno of California introduced a bill that would require a kill switch for phones sold in California. That bill might be on the floor of the Senate for a vote as early as next week. ''The wireless industry today has taken an incremental yet inadequate step to address the epidemic of smartphone theft,'' Mr. Leno said in a statement. ''Only weeks ago, they claimed that the approach they are taking today was infeasible and counterproductive. While I am encouraged they are moving off of that position so quickly, today's 'opt-in' proposal misses the mark if the ultimate goal is to combat street crime and violent thefts involving smartphones and tablets.'' The latest software system on Apple's iPhones and iPads already include a kill-switch solution called Activation Lock. Still, phone theft continues to grow. In San Francisco, 2,400 cellphones were stolen last year, a 23 percent rise from 2012, according to the San Francisco police. Phone thefts also grew in New York and Washington, D.C., last year, according to statistics from the police in those cities. "
Top U.S. Retailers to Share Data in Fight on Cybercrime,"Some of the nation's largest retailers are banding together in hopes of protecting consumers' personal and financial information from hackers and thieves. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, along with several top retailers, like Gap and Walgreen, on Wednesday opened an intelligence-sharing center focused on the prevention of cybercrimes against retailers. According to the retail group, the center will allow retailers to share information about data breaches and potential threats as well as to inform industry analysts and members of law enforcement. Other participating retailers include Nike, Lowe's and Target, which was hit with a large data breach at the height of last year's holiday shopping season. The Target breach resulted in the theft of 40 million debit and credit card numbers, as well as the personal information of up to 70 million shoppers. While work on the intelligence-sharing center began in the wake of the Target breach and smaller breaches at Neiman Marcus and Michaels Stores, Sandy Kennedy, president of the retail leaders' group, said data crime had been a big concern for the industry well before those breaches occurred. ''All of our members have been focused on this for a long time,'' she said. She also said: ''We're looking at how we can deal with this long term.''  "
U.S. Gains in a Spat With China Over Tariffs,"WASHINGTON -- The World Trade Organization sided with the United States on Friday in a dispute over punitive Chinese tariffs on American exports of cars and sport utility vehicles. China, which joined the W.T.O. in 2001 in a move that signaled its broader entry into the global market system, had already lifted the tariffs involved in the dispute, but American officials declared victory, citing the decision as the latest in a series of rulings that it has won against Beijing. ''China has had 14 years -- 14 years -- to start playing by the rules,'' said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, at a news conference in Washington. ''But instead we see illegal and improper activities over and over again. As long as China keeps up this illegal behavior, we can and must respond with these kinds of strong enforcement actions.''  The decision comes against a backdrop of increasing commercial tensions between Beijing and Washington. The Obama administration has criticized China for its supposed state-sponsored spying on American firms, and challenged its willingness to play by the rules over trade in cars, steel and chickens and other goods. The broader diplomatic situation has become tense as well, over concerns about how to deal with North Korea and whether China's territorial ambitions in the South China Sea and elsewhere threaten United States allies in the region. On Monday, the United States filed criminal charges against Chinese military officers, accusing them of breaking into the computer networks of American companies and a union group. That prompted Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, to ask the administration to file a new suit against China at the W.T.O. ''Cyberattacks from China and other nations could prove crippling to American businesses in the years to come, so we need real teeth in our response,'' Mr. Schumer said. In response to the Justice Department action, China pulled out of a working group on cybersecurity and said that Washington's action ''grossly violates the basic norms governing international relations.'' Even though the new W.T.O. ruling will have no immediate practical effect, it is seen as potentially important for American businesses, as it might discourage China from putting up antidumping or anti-subsidy tariffs in response to foreign trade actions that it dislikes in the future. ''This is an important case, and it's an important victory and it is important for the auto industry,'' said Representative Sander Levin, also a Michigan Democrat. ''It's important for manufacturing. But it's important even beyond that.'' Mr. Levin said that it showed that the administration would be tough with China, demanding an equal playing field for American workers and firms. China imposed antidumping tariffs of 2 to 8.9 percent on American cars and S.U.V.s with an engine displacement of more than 2.5 liters in December 2011, saying that these vehicles were being sold to dealers in China for less than the full cost of manufacturing them. China also imposed additional anti-subsidy tariffs of 12.9 percent on large-engine passenger vehicles from General Motors and 6.2 percent on these vehicles, mainly Jeeps, from Chrysler. Beijing contended that the government-managed bankruptcies of G.M. and Chrysler had the effect of providing subsidies for these manufacturers' exports. A W.T.O. panel in Geneva spent more than a year reviewing legal briefs from the two sides over the Chinese commerce ministry's action. China's ''unjustified duties'' affected about $5 billion in automobile exports, said Michael B. Froman, the United States trade representative. ''This is also an important victory that impacts our nation's workers and their families.'' American trade officials said that they did not know the actual dollar value of any lost sales because of China's tariffs. The W.T.O. panel found that in imposing penalties on imported large-engine vehicles, China had failed to prove first that the imports were causing any injury to its domestic industry. International free-trade rules require a so-called injury determination to prevent countries from imposing tariffs to forestall imports from entering at all, instead of waiting to see if they actually cause a problem. The panel also found fault with the Chinese government's methodology in calculating that automakers with factories in the United States -- including Daimler, which makes Mercedes-Benz, and BMW of Germany -- had underpriced their sales in China. Large cars and S.U.V.s in China often cost as much as three times as the same models cost in the United States, although this is mostly because of heavy taxes that China has imposed in large-engine market segments where its domestic manufacturers have virtually no sales. Officials at the commerce ministry in Beijing and at the Chinese mission to the W.T.O. in Geneva did not respond to requests for comment. The W.T.O. ruling is the third in favor of the United States in recent years. Beijing and Washington have also disagreed on trade terms for broiler chickens, rare earth minerals, tires, steel and auto parts. A separate W.T.O. panel is considering an American complaint that China has subsidized exports of car parts to the United States. Automakers have been rushing to shift production of practically every model to China, as it has emerged as the world's largest market in terms of the number of vehicles sold, although the American market remains somewhat larger in dollar terms. From the start, China's commerce ministry imposed the tariffs for a term of only two years, and they expired in December. An American analysis of the tariffs found that China has not been collecting them since then. The United States nonetheless pressed for the W.T.O. to declare that China had misapplied antidumping and anti-subsidy rules in imposing the tariffs at all. The goal was to set a legal precedent limiting China's ability to slap antidumping and anti-subsidy tariffs on other products without following internationally approved procedures. The losing party in W.T.O. cases almost always appeals the decision, and sometimes both sides do so, with the winner seeking a clearer endorsement of its position. China has a consistent track record of appealing when it loses on the panel report. "
"Hacker Helped Disrupt Attacks, Prosecutors Say","A prominent hacker set to be sentenced in federal court this week for breaking into numerous computer systems worldwide has provided a trove of information to the authorities, allowing them to disrupt at least 300 cyberattacks on targets that included the United States military, Congress, the federal courts, NASA and private companies, according to a newly filed government court document. The hacker, Hector Xavier Monsegur, also helped the authorities dismantle a particularly aggressive cell of the hacking collective Anonymous, leading to the arrest of eight of its members in Europe and the United States, including Jeremy Hammond, who the Federal Bureau of Investigation said was its top ''cybercriminal target,'' the document said. Mr. Hammond is serving a 10-year prison term. The court document was prepared by prosecutors who are asking a judge, Loretta A. Preska, for leniency for Mr. Monsegur because of his ''extraordinary cooperation.'' He is set to be sentenced on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan on hacking conspiracy and other charges that could result in a long prison term.  It has been known since 2012 that Mr. Monsegur, who was arrested in 2011, was acting as a government mole in the shadowy world of computer hacking, but the memorandum submitted to Judge Preska late on Friday reveals for the first time the extent of his assistance and what the government perceives of its value. It also offers the government's first explanation of Mr. Monsegur's involvement in a series of coordinated attacks on foreign websites in early 2012, though his precise role is in dispute. The whereabouts of Mr. Monsegur have been shrouded in mystery. Since his cooperation with the authorities became known, he has been vilified online by supporters of Anonymous, of which he was a member. The memo, meanwhile, said the government became so concerned about his safety that it relocated him and some members of his family. ''Monsegur repeatedly was approached on the street and threatened or menaced about his cooperation once it became publicly known,'' said the memo, which was filed by the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. Born in 1983, Mr. Monsegur moved to the Jacob Riis housing project on the Lower East Side of Manhattan at a young age, where he lived with his grandmother after his father and aunt were arrested for selling heroin. He became involved with hacking groups in the late 1990s, drawn, he has indicated, to the groups' anti-government philosophies. Mr. Monsegur's role emerged in March 2012 when the authorities announced charges against Mr. Hammond and others. A few months later, Mr. Monsegur's bail was revoked after he made ''unauthorized online postings,'' the document said without elaboration. He was jailed for about seven months, then released on bail in December 2012, and has made no further postings, it said. The memo said that when Mr. Monsegur (who used the Internet alias Sabu) was first approached by F.B.I. agents in June 2011 and questioned about his online activities, he admitted to criminal conduct and immediately agreed to cooperate with law enforcement. That night, he reviewed his computer files with the agents, and throughout the summer, he daily ''provided, in real time, information'' that allowed the government to disrupt attacks and identify ''vulnerabilities in significant computer systems,'' the memo said. ''Working sometimes literally around the clock,'' it added, ''at the direction of law enforcement, Monsegur engaged his co-conspirators in online chats that were critical to confirming their identities and whereabouts.'' His primary assistance was his cooperation against Anonymous and its splinter groups Internet Feds and LulzSec. ''He provided detailed historical information about the activities of Anonymous, contributing greatly to law enforcement's understanding of how Anonymous operates,'' the memo said. Neither Mr. Bharara's office nor a lawyer for Mr. Monsegur would comment about the memo. Mr. Monsegur provided an extraordinary window on the activities of LulzSec, which he and five other members of Anonymous had created. The memo describes LulzSec as a ''tightly knit group of hackers'' who worked as a team with ''complementary, specialized skills that enabled them to gain unauthorized access to computer systems, damage and exploit those systems, and publicize their hacking activities.'' The memo said that LulzSec had developed an ''action plan to destroy evidence and disband if the group determined that any of its members had been arrested, or were out of touch,'' and it credits Mr. Monsegur for agreeing so quickly to cooperate after being confronted by the bureau. Had he delayed his decision and remained offline for an extended period, the document said, ''it is likely that much of the evidence regarding LulzSec's activities would have been destroyed.'' After his arrest, Mr. Monsegur provided information that helped repair a hack of PBS's website in which he had been a ''direct participant,'' and helped patch a vulnerability in the Senate's website. He also provided information about ''vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, including at a water utility for an American city, and a foreign energy company,'' the document said. The coordinated attacks on foreign government websites in 2012 exploited a vulnerability in a popular web hosting software. The targets included Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and Brazil, according to court documents in Mr. Hammond's case. The memo said that ''at law enforcement direction,'' Mr. Monsegur tried to obtain details about the software vulnerability but was unsuccessful. ''At the same time, Monsegur was able to learn of many hacks, including hacks of foreign government computer servers, committed by these targets and other hackers, enabling the government to notify the victims, wherever feasible,'' the memo said. The memo does not specify which of the foreign governments the United States alerted about the vulnerabilities. But according to a recent prison interview with Mr. Hammond as well as logs of Internet chats between him and Mr. Monsegur, which were submitted to the court in Mr. Hammond's case, Mr. Monsegur seemed to have played a more active role in directing some of the attacks. In the chat logs, Mr. Monsegur directed Mr. Hammond to hack numerous foreign websites, and closely monitored whether Mr. Hammond had success in gaining access to the sites. Sarah Kunstler, a lawyer for Mr. Hammond, said on Saturday: ''The government's characterization of Sabu's role is false. Far from protecting foreign governments, Sabu identified targets and actively facilitated the hacks of their computer systems.'' At his sentencing in November, Mr. Hammond was prohibited by Judge Preska from naming the foreign governments that Mr. Monsegur had asked him to hack. But, according to an uncensored version of a court statement by Mr. Hammond that appeared online that day, the target list included more than 2,000 Internet domains in numerous countries. Mr. Hammond's sentencing statement also said that Mr. Monsegur encouraged other hackers to give him data from Syrian government websites, including those of banks and ministries associated with the leadership of President Bashar al-Assad. "
Hacker Group Lashes Out Against Informant,"SAN FRANCISCO -- While Hector Xavier Monsegur awaited sentencing for charges that could bring him a lengthy prison term, his former partners in the hacker collective Anonymous and the group's sympathizers expressed their feelings online.  On Twitter, where Mr. Monsegur first gained notoriety as a hacker and later as a federal informant, many denounced him as a ''traitor'' and a ''snitch.'' Some posted T-shirts featuring a caricature of Mr. Monsegur as Tweety Bird, the cartoon canary, and asked that hackers warn one another about Mr. Monsegur's whereabouts. Some linked to websites containing Mr. Monsegur's Social Security number, the names of his family members and his previous address. Mr. Monsegur's sentence, which was initially expected last year, has been repeatedly delayed, without explanation. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan on hacking conspiracy and other charges. Prosecutors have asked the judge for leniency because of Mr. Monsegur's ''extraordinary cooperation'' that they said has allowed the authorities to disrupt at least 300 cyberattacks on high-profile and international targets. According to a memorandum submitted to the judge late Friday, Mr. Monsegur has been repeatedly approached and threatened over cooperating with the government. Concerned about his safety, the memo said, the government relocated Mr. Monsegur and his family. As this latest sentencing date neared, many people online resurrected the slogan ''Free Hammond,'' referring to Jeremy Hammond, one of several hackers whom the authorities indicted through Mr. Monsegur's cooperation. He is serving a 10-year prison sentence. Mr. Monsegur's information led to charges against several hackers, and all but one pleaded guilty. Many hackers and security researchers have accused Mr. Monsegur of entrapment. Some posted archived Twitter messages between Mr. Monsegur, whose online alias was ''Sabu,'' and others whom they claimed he baited into discussions about hacking domestic and foreign targets. Among those who have accused Mr. Monsegur of entrapment is Jacob Appelbaum, the privacy activist and onetime WikiLeaks volunteer. ''He would encourage me to do criminal things with him -- which I always refused,'' Mr. Appelbaum said Saturday in a message posted on Twitter. Members of the group Anonymous posted an image featuring Mr. Monsegur and the judge overseeing his case, Judge Loretta A. Preska, in tutus with the words, ''Back in the U.S.S.R. Democracy's enemies are disguised as Bolshoi Dancers.'' ''We will not forgive and we will not forget until every Anon is free,'' the Anonymous post read. "
Hacker Who Became a Federal Informer Is Allowed to Walk Free,"The New York man whose cooperation helped the authorities infiltrate the shadowy world of computer hacking and disrupt at least 300 cyberattacks on targets that included the United States military, courts and private companies was given a greatly reduced sentence on Tuesday of time served and allowed to walk free. Federal prosecutors had sought leniency for the hacker, Hector Xavier Monsegur, citing his efforts in helping the Federal Bureau of Investigation take down an aggressive group of hackers who were part of the collective Anonymous, with which he had been involved, and its splinter groups, which had taken credit for attacking government and corporate websites.  Mr. Monsegur's information, the authorities said, led to the arrest of eight ''major co-conspirators,'' including Jeremy Hammond, whom the F.B.I. had called its top ''cybercriminal target'' and who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in November. The judge, Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court, gave Mr. Monsegur time served, calling his cooperation ''truly extraordinary''; he had spent seven months in custody in 2012. ''You obviously have great skill,'' Judge Preska told Mr. Monsegur, who used the Internet alias Sabu. ''To deploy that skill for good would be a very good thing. ''You have done as much as any human being can do in terms of helping the government to make up for your past wrongs and to avert other damage to probably millions of people,'' she added. ''So, I salute you for that.'' The advisory federal sentencing guidelines had called for a term of roughly 21 to 26 years, although the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, had asked that he receive a substantially lower sentence. ''Through his cooperation, we averted untold millions of dollars in loss to victims,'' a prosecutor, James J. Pastore Jr., told the judge. ''We also averted potential really catastrophic problems with critical infrastructure.'' Judge Preska cited ''the immediacy of Mr. Monsegur's cooperation and its around-the-clock nature.'' Mr. Monsegur agreed to cooperate immediately upon being confronted by agents in June 2011, prosecutors have said. At the time of his arrest, Mr. Monsegur was serving as a foster parent for two young female cousins; his federal public defenders, Peggy Cross-Goldenberg and Philip L. Weinstein, said in court papers that their client's decision to cooperate had not been a difficult one. ''His family came first,'' the lawyers wrote. ''He would do whatever he had to do to protect the girls and avoid their placement in the foster care system.'' Judge Preska noted that Mr. Monsegur and his family had been subjected to threats after his role as a cooperator became known in March 2012. As prosecutors have said in court papers, he had been vilified online by supporters of Anonymous and was repeatedly ''approached on the street and threatened or menaced about his cooperation.'' The authorities were so concerned about his safety that they relocated Mr. Monsegur and certain members of his family, prosecutors have said. ''He despairs when he thinks of what he put his family through,'' Ms. Cross-Goldenberg said in court. Mr. Monsegur, 30, who as a youth lived in the Jacob Riis housing project on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, pleaded guilty before Judge Preska in August 2011 to 12 counts of hacking conspiracy and other charges. He was released on bail, but his bail was revoked in May 2012 after he made ''unauthorized online postings,'' the government has said. He served seven months in custody and was again released on bail in December 2012. While detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, he developed and taught a computer-skills course, Ms. Cross-Goldenberg told the judge. In court, Mr. Monsegur told the judge that in the past three years, he had ''gone through a lot of changes, learned a lot of lessons.'' ''I assure you I will not be in this courtroom ever again,'' he added. ''I'm not the same person you saw three years ago. I'm ready to move on.'' As part of the sentence, the judge imposed a one-year period of supervised release, including what she called ''a computer monitoring program.'' After the hearing, Mr. Weinstein said that his client was now looking for a good job. ''He has a skill set that is very unique,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''He schooled the agents on things they didn't know about.'' "
"A Vigilante and a Techie, Too","To the pantheon of lawbreaking folk heroes in American culture, alongside the mobster and the Wild West gunslinger, we can add the computer hacker. Matthew Broderick's character in the 1983 movie ''WarGames'' may have been Patient Zero for this strain, followed by figures from William Gibson's cyberpunk novels, ''The Matrix'' and a parade of forgettable 1990s Hollywood thrillers. Aiden Pearce, the protagonist of ''Watch Dogs,'' a new video game blockbuster that arrived this week to anticipation worthy of an Apple keynote presentation, is a blend of the heroic hacker and an earlier archetype, the street-crime vigilante. He is Julian Assange or Edward J. Snowden crossed with Charles Bronson and Batman.  Pearce lives in a place that is Chicago yet not Chicago, recognizable for Lake Shore Drive and the El train but with a baseball team that won the World Series in 1941. Slightly less far-fetched is a municipal computing system that controls the infrastructure while also allowing the government -- along with private hackers and corporations with the skill -- to surveil the citizenry. After his niece is murdered in an apparent act of vengeance for something in his criminal past, Pearce allies himself with the city's computing underground, including an Anonymous-like collective known as DedSec. He carries an iPhone-ish device that allows him to spy through anything that has a camera (laptops, cellphones, security terminals) and to detect a person's name, age, occupation and salary. There's a brilliant conceit at the core of Watch Dogs, a vision of a game you might call Grand Theft Anonymous, in which the heroes and villains wield smartphones instead of sniper rifles. While driving through the gorgeously rendered streetscape, Pearce can evade his pursuers by scrambling traffic lights, raising bridges and other barriers, or (most destructively) exploding subterranean steam pipes. He can invoke a temporary blackout to escape under cover of darkness or jam police communications to elude capture. He infiltrates buildings virtually to uncover secrets, bouncing from security camera to security camera. (In practice, the player does all the hacking for Pearce either by pressing a single button or by rotating pipe fittings to solve simple puzzles; Pearce's Internet really is a series of tubes.) Layered on top of this exhilarating essence, alas, is a much more conventional game that mashes together a facsimile of the open-world masterpieces of Rockstar Games with Assassin's Creed, a franchise that, like Watch Dogs, is developed by the French giant Ubisoft. If you've ever wanted Grand Theft Auto games to require you to climb towers to unlock parts of the map and to include annoying tailing missions that restart instantly if you're detected, then Watch Dogs is the game for you. As in ''The Matrix,'' there are guns, lots of guns. The hacking quickly becomes merely an unusual accessory -- a bow tie, or maybe a jaunty hat -- that is packaged with a navy suit you've been sold before. There is undisputedly a lot to do here. After spending four days with the main story line, I have completed less than 40 percent of the game, according to Ubisoft's progression statistics. There are still convoys to obstruct, crimes to prevent, cars to steal, human-trafficking victims to save, codes to crack, towers to climb and mini-games to check out: poker, chess, drinking contests, the shell game, smartphone diversions and psychedelic ''digital trips'' that can lead Pearce to bounce in a field of giant flowers. Watch Dogs is an overstuffed burrito, familiarly delicious but packed with so many ingredients that it struggles to retain its shape. Some online elements have great promise, though it has not been possible to test them under the strain of public servers. Most notably, in a tactic borrowed from the Dark Souls games, other players can invade your game while you're playing and hack into your account to steal from you. You're notified once the attempt has started, and you have to scour the area to find the other player's character and shoot him or her if you don't want the job to be finished. The tourism in the game is deep and interesting, if occasionally confused by the intermingling of the real history of Al Capone, John Dillinger and the 1893 World's Fair with unidentified fictional elements. (The World News is the most-read newspaper in the city, and the nation's tallest building is called the Vault Tower.) There's a small competitive aspect to the virtual sightseeing that's very much like Foursquare: Check in enough times at a particular spot, and you become that location's ''mayor,'' with your nickname advertised for all to see. Some of the writing is terrific. When Pearce scans a crowd of faces with his superphone, he can detect a stray fact about each person that someone had a very good time inventing: A cop might be a baking enthusiast, or maybe he's removed carbohydrates from his diet. A gynecologist might be a habitual procrastinator, or she could go fishing with dynamite. A pedestrian could be a social media celebrity, in remission from cancer, a hentai enthusiast, a registered sex offender, a mineral collector, a hoarder, a clown fetishist. At times, this storytelling technique carries more weight, as when the young women in a gang's headquarters are revealed as runaways and immigrants forced into sexual slavery. But the rest of the script is mediocre, with underdeveloped characters and more villains than a superhero movie. The watchable cinematic scenes alternate between maudlin and merely dull, and Pearce's frequent narration is overlong and often redundant. The cast is filled with hoarse whisperers who talk like Littlefinger, Aidan Gillen's character in the HBO series ''Game of Thrones.'' Slow-motion footage and piano tinkling are not enough on their own to create drama, and worse, the somber narrative tone is at odds with the tense joy created by the interactive play. Aiden Pearce, you just disabled a helicopter with your phone, raced your car underneath a highway overpass and leapt over a raised bridge. Why so glum? Watch Dogs, developed for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and Windows PC, is rated M (Mature, for players 17 and older). It has lots of killing and some nudity. "
China Pulls Cisco Into Dispute on Cyberspying,"TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Amid heightening tension between Washington and Beijing over online espionage, a Chinese state media outlet has sharply criticized the American network equipment maker Cisco Systems, saying it is complicit with United States cyberspying. Cisco denied the accusations. Cisco ''carries on intimately with the U.S. government and military, exploiting its market advantage in the Chinese information networks, playing a disgraceful role and becoming an important weapon in the U.S. exploiting its power over the Internet,'' said the article, which was published on the website of China Youth Daily, a state-run newspaper. The article was widely reposted on Chinese news sites Tuesday.  Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., said it did not provide any sort of electronic back doors in its products. ''Cisco does not work with any government to weaken our products for exploitation,'' John Earnhardt, a Cisco spokesman, said in a statement. ''Additionally, Cisco does not monitor communications of private citizens or government organizations in China or anywhere in the world.'' Last week, the United States announced the indictments of five members of the Chinese military, saying that they had hacked the computer networks of several major American companies and a trade union. That move touched off recriminations from China and concern that rising tensions between the two countries would have repercussions for foreign technology companies pursuing business in China. Beijing denounced the indictments and accused Washington of hypocrisy in light of the revelations from the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden about widespread surveillance by the United States. Fresh accusations came in a new report on Monday from the China's Internet Media Research Center. Although the report relied heavily on foreign news accounts of Mr. Snowden's revelations, it said that Beijing's official inquiries had borne out his assertions that Chinese leaders and companies had been targeted. The People's Daily, the mouthpiece of China's ruling Communist Party, said in an opinion piece posted on its website Monday that the United States raised the issue of cyberspying because it wanted to thwart China's development, cover up its own actions and blunt the pressure of domestic public opinion. China's State Internet Information Office said last week that the government would begin requiring security examinations of equipment from foreign suppliers before it could be sold in the domestic market, a move analysts described as retaliation for the indictments. That pattern of escalation will probably continue, said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting, a Beijing-based information technology consulting firm. ''I think it is certainly difficult for policy makers and other authorities here to simply sit back and be subject to these sorts of allegations and say nothing,'' he said. ''I do think we'll see some more escalation, and hopefully, it will not be permanent. Hopefully, it will not last too long. Right now it's hard to imagine it all clearing away.'' Just before the indictments were announced, China said it was banning Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system on government computers. The state media said the move was prompted by security concerns after the retirement of the 12-year-old Windows XP system in April. On Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported that Chinese government agencies were examining whether the use of IBM servers by the country's banks posed a risk to financial security, citing unidentified sources. IBM responded with a statement, saying: ''IBM is not aware of any Chinese government policy recommending against the use of IBM servers within the country's banking industry. In fact, news reports now state that China's National Development and Reform Commission has not heard of any alleged directive to that effect. IBM is a trusted partner in China and has been for more than 30 years.'' About 15 percent of Cisco's revenue of $34.8 billion for the nine-month period ended in April came from Asia, including China, the company said this month. In that time, overall sales in Asia dropped 9 percent, and sales in China dropped 7 percent. The company noted that it was experiencing pressure from ''price-focused competitors from Asia, especially from China'' -- most likely a reference to Huawei and ZTE, the leading Chinese telecommunications equipment makers. United States officials have warned that Huawei posed a threat to national security and sought to restrict its ability to develop networks in the United States and for American allies. In 2012 a congressional panel cited documents from former Huawei employees that said the company had provided services to China's military. Legislation signed by President Obama last year prevents the federal government from purchasing equipment made by Huawei or other Chinese telecommunications equipment makers without a security review. Huawei has denied that it has close ties to China's military or that its products present security vulnerabilities. The Chinese state media have voiced concerns about Cisco's role in the nation's digital infrastructure before. Last year, the state-run China Daily newspaper cited an unidentified analyst who said, ''There is a terrible security threat in China from U.S.-based technology companies including Cisco, Apple and Microsoft.''

Whither Yo?,"It's hard to talk about Yo. The app is so simple (it lets users send the word ""Yo"" to each other) that even to mock it feels like taking it too seriously - come on guys, it's just Yo! Luckily, hackers have made things easier on all of us by making Yo do some new tricks. Pre-hack, critics had to evaluate Yo on its merits, which was somewhat difficult, since it has so few of them (and so few demerits, for that matter). Nonetheless, some rose to the challenge. At Yahoo, Alyssa Bereznak said the app's one message ""might be succinct, but then so is throwing a brick through the window."" She cast her vote for modes of communication with some non-""Yo"" options:  ""There are so many other fun, inspired ways to get a person's attention via social media: @signing his username under a funny photo on Instagram, texting her with just an emoji cactus, liking a Facebook photo from three years ago. The best messaging apps are the ones that act as a platform for inventive individual expression."" Jeff Macke, also at Yahoo, was pro-Yo: ""Yo didn't go viral because we're all idiots. Yo taps in to something that impacts us all."" He added that the app's creator, Or Arbel, called ""Yo"" an example of ""'context-based communications,' meaning it means different things depending on who it's from and when."" Indeed, Mr. Arbel told The Times: ""People think it's just an app that says 'Yo.' But it's really not. We like to call it context-based messaging. You understand by the context what is being said."" Others saw Yo - specifically, the fact that Mr. Arbel was able to raise $1 million worth of funding - as a sign of bigger problems with the tech industry. At ThinkProgress, Judd Legum wrote: ""The larger problem is whether an economy built on seven-figure investments in apps like Yo is sustainable. If Arbel can convince sophisticated investors that Yo already merits a $1 million investment, maybe he is onto something. Or maybe the potential of Yo is not in the product itself, but on the ability in a frenzied marketplace to quickly flip Yo to another company for a profit and move onto the next app. It was too many of those kinds of transactions - divorced from revenue or value of the consumer - that caused the entire system to crash at the turn of the century."" Whether that will happen remains to be seen, but Yo is already dealing with a smaller disaster. TechCrunch's Mike Butcher reports that the site has been hacked, possibly multiple times. One rather polite hacker sent TechCrunch this description of what he and his friends had done: ""We can get any Yo user's phone number (I actually texted the founder, and he called me back). We can spoof Yo's from any users, and we can spam any user with as many Yo. We could also send any Yo user a push notification with any text we want (though we decided not to do that)."" Mr. Butcher notes that another user may have figured out how to use Yo to rickroll people. The Yo team hopes to have the problems fixed during the day on Friday, but news of the hack has intensified anti-Yo sentiment in some quarters. It has also been a boon to headline writers - highlights include ""Yo app goes from dumb to dangerous with new security hack"" and ""Yo app hacked to say things that aren't 'Yo.'"" If you're a Yo early adopter and you're worried about the hack, Abby Phillip of The Washington Post has instructions for getting your contact info deleted from Yo's databases: ""All you have to do is email contact@justyo.co, ask to be removed and that's it."" Or, perhaps you could just write, ""Yo."" If context is as important as Mr. Arbel says it is, his team should know what you mean.                       "
Ruling Revives Debate Over When a Fantasy Crosses a Criminal Line,"In his mind and online persona, Gilberto Valle left little doubt about the depths of his depravation: In communications over the Internet, he imagined subjecting women he knew to sex-related torture and, in some cases, murder and cannibalism. And, prosecutors said, that activity and other actions were all part of what they described as a kidnapping conspiracy, a charge for which he was convicted in 2013.  But on Tuesday, a federal judge in Manhattan ordered Mr. Valle, 30, released on bond just hours after overturning his conviction. The judge, in a decision released late Monday night, concluded that Mr. Valle's Internet plotting had been ''fantasy role play'' and was not evidence of an actual crime. ''This is a conspiracy that existed solely in cyberspace,'' the judge, Paul G. Gardephe of Federal District Court, said in a 118-page opinion that granted a judgment of acquittal to Mr. Valle, a former New York City police officer who had faced a potential life sentence for his conviction. ''The highly unusual facts of this case reflect the Internet age in which we live,'' Judge Gardephe added. The ruling resurrected the key issue in Mr. Valle's widely followed trial: When does a virtual crime, contemplated in Internet chat rooms, become an actual crime? Joseph V. DeMarco, an Internet lawyer and a former head of the cybercrime unit in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, said after reading the decision: ''I think that the court was profoundly disturbed by the relative lack of evidence in the kinetic world corroborating the defendant's intent to carry through on any of the communications.'' ''What this case, I think, emphasizes,'' Mr. DeMarco added, ''is that people have broad rights to express fantasies online, which can lead to a lot of speech that people find disturbing and repugnant but which nonetheless will not cross the line into criminal liability.'' Judge Gardephe wrote that in the charged conspiracy, all communications between Mr. Valle and his alleged co-conspirators in New Jersey and overseas took place over the Internet. None of the conspirators ever met or spoke by phone, exchanged accurate information about where they lived or even knew or sought to learn one another's true identities, he observed. ''Moreover,'' the judge wrote, ''the nearly yearlong kidnapping conspiracy alleged by the government is one in which no one was ever kidnapped, no attempted kidnapping ever took place, and no real-world, non-Internet-based steps were ever taken to kidnap anyone.'' At trial, prosecutors argued that Mr. Valle took ''concrete steps'' to further the kidnapping plot, including illegally looking up potential victims in a law enforcement database, carrying out surveillance of them and using the Internet to research ways to abduct, subdue and cook potential victims. ''He left the world of fantasy; he entered the world of reality,'' a prosecutor, Hadassa Waxman, said in her closing argument. But in his ruling, Judge Gardephe wrote that ''once the lies and the fantastical elements are stripped away, what is left are deeply disturbing misogynistic chats and emails written by an individual obsessed with imagining women he knows suffering horrific sex-related pain, terror and degradation. ''Despite the highly disturbing nature of Valle's deviant and depraved sexual interests, his chats and emails about these interests are not sufficient -- standing alone -- to make out the elements of conspiracy to commit kidnapping.'' The judge upheld Mr. Valle's conviction on a second count, of illegally gaining access to the law enforcement database, which carried a maximum sentence of one year. Mr. Valle was fired by the Police Department upon his conviction. Julia L. Gatto, Mr. Valle's lead lawyer, speaking outside the courthouse after her client was ordered released, criticized the government for what she called ''an overzealous prosecution.'' ''He is guilty of nothing more than very unconventional thoughts,'' she said, ''but as Judge Gardephe has validated, we don't put people in jail for their thoughts. We're not the thought police, and the court system is not the deputies of the thought police.'' A spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office had no comment on the ruling or on Ms. Gatto's comments. Ms. Waxman said in court on Tuesday that the government intended to appeal and asked that Mr. Valle continue to be detained pending that appeal. Judge Gardephe rejected the request, ordering Mr. Valle released on $100,000 personal recognizance bond and restricted to home detention. The judge ordered that Mr. Valle not use a computer or the Internet and that he avoid contact with witnesses who testified at his trial or individuals who prosecutors had said were targets of his kidnapping conspiracy. He was also to receive a mental health evaluation and treatment if deemed appropriate. ''Justice delayed in this case is not justice denied, thanks to this judge,'' Mr. Valle's father, Gil Valle-Lopez, said in the courtroom, just before the hearing. Mr. Valle stood with his lawyers and his mother, Elizabeth, on Tuesday afternoon after his release. He said he wanted ''to apologize to everyone who has been hurt, shocked and offended by my infantile actions.'' After thanking his legal team, he also thanked the staff at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he had been held since his arrest in late 2012, and also inmates whom he had ''gotten to know pretty well.'' ''They've made this impossible situation more tolerable for me, and I'll never forget them,'' he said. "
Science Journal Pulls 60 Papers in Peer-Review Fraud,"A scientific journal has retracted 60 papers linked to a researcher in Taiwan, accusing him of ''perverting the peer-review process'' by creating fraudulent online accounts to judge the papers favorably and help get them published. Sage Publications, publisher of The Journal of Vibration and Control, in which the papers appeared over the last four years, said the researcher, Chen-Yuan Chen, had established a ''peer-review and citation ring'' consisting of fake scientists as well as real ones whose identities he had assumed. It said that in at least one case, Mr. Chen, who also uses the first name Peter, reviewed his own paper using one of the aliases.  In all, Mr. Chen, an associate professor of computer science who resigned in February from the National Pingtung University of Education amid an investigation, appears to have created 130 email accounts that were used in reviewing the papers. A spokeswoman for the publisher said it had contacted all the accounts but received no replies. Sage said that the retracted papers all had at least one author or reviewer implicated in the ring, and that it was possible that other scientists were involved in the activity. Chen Chien-huang, the university's chief secretary, said by email on Friday morning that the university is still looking into the case. ''We are continuing to investigate according to the materials just publicized by JVC,'' he wrote. ''Whether there are other professors involved is still under investigation.'' He said the whereabouts of Chen-Yuan Chen was unknown. The retractions were first reported on the blog Retraction Watch. The journal -- whose former editor, Ali F. Nayfeh, an emeritus professor of engineering at Virginia Tech, resigned in May as the investigation was drawing to a close -- publishes studies on subjects like signal analysis and noise control. Among the retracted papers was one titled ''Ant-Inspired Collective Problem-Solving Systems.'' The publisher said it and Mr. Nayfeh first suspected misconduct last year and eventually contacted the university. The spokeswoman for Sage said it was never able to talk with Mr. Chen directly. Mr. Nayfeh could not be reached for comment. Mehdi Ahmadian, another Virginia Tech professor and one of three senior editors appointed to replace Mr. Nayfeh, referred a request for comment to the publisher. Most scientific and other academic journals use peer review, in which papers are accepted based partly on the judgment of independent researchers. Many publishers, including Sage, have set up systems in which the process is conducted online. The spokeswoman said Sage did not have any concerns about its system. Most retractions related to fraud involve cases where data was fabricated or altered. But there have been a few other cases in which researchers have tried to manipulate the peer-review process. In 2012, Retraction Watch reported on a South Korean plant researcher who created fake email accounts so that he could review his own papers. When the fraud was uncovered, over 30 papers were retracted. Michael B. Eisen, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a critic of peer review, said that in many countries, including Taiwan, academic institutions have an ''almost explicit'' formula for promotions based on the quantity, rather than quality, of published papers. ''That creates room for various forms of shenanigans,'' he said. ''It doesn't surprise me that much that something like this happens.'' "
Popular Prepaid Money Card Opens Path to Fraud Schemes,"Federal authorities are sounding alarms about a wide range of fraudulent schemes involving a popular prepaid money card product. Thousands of consumers have been lured into sending money through the card, called MoneyPak. For online fraudsters, the reusable green-and-white paper card that can be used to quickly ""reload,"" or transfer, hundreds of dollars in cash onto another prepaid card is often the money conduit of choice, regulators and law enforcement officials say. The abuses are mounting as the market in prepaid cards is increasingly finding favor with Americans who don't have access to a traditional bank account or credit card. The roughly $80 billion that consumers are expected to put on prepaid debit cards this year is double the amount put on those products in 2010, according to the Mercator Advisory Group, a banking industry consulting firm. Consumers also use the cards to transfer money into PayPal accounts to shop online.  Law enforcement officials are also concerned about drug dealers and other criminals using MoneyPak to launder small sums of cash, because money transfers using the cards are hard to track. ""We are increasingly seeing MoneyPaks used to facilitate Internet fraud schemes and it is a concern for us,"" said David A. O'Neil, deputy assistant attorney general for the criminal division of the Justice Department. ""Anything that makes it easier to get money from the victim to a fraudster concerns us."" The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently said that it was looking into consumer complaints about prepaid cards. The abuse of MoneyPak, a perfectly legal prepaid card, has created a problem for its seller, Green Dot, the largest provider of reloadable prepaid debit cards, according to Mercator. A Pasadena, Calif., bank holding company, Green Dot says it now has a technological answer to address the worst of the illegal uses. A new electronic cash-transfer system it is installing in most of the 92,000 retail stores that sell its products will ultimately replace the MoneyPak altogether, the company says. Still, consumer advocates and some in law enforcement question whether the technological fix will work or whether fraudsters would then gravitate to similar but less popular products offered by other prepaid card companies. The schemes that use MoneyPak involve fraudsters posing as bill collectors, bail bondsmen, government officials or sales agents in emails, online ads or phone calls. Over the last two years, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued at least a half-dozen alerts about schemes involving a MoneyPak. In June, Victor Jones, of Arlington, Va., fell victim to one of those scams when he sent $267 to a company that promised to write him a $2,500 loan if he first sent it a handling and processing fee using a MoneyPak. A 33-year-old building services engineer, Mr. Jones never got his loan or his money back. Another victim was Diane Stephens, 54, of White Plains, who says she lost $2,000 when she sent money using a MoneyPak to a company she found online to participate as a ""mystery shopper."" In most cases, the victim is directed to go to a Walgreens, CVS, Duane Reade or another big retailer that sells prepaid cards, buy a MoneyPak and have the cashier put as much as $500 on the card. The victim then is typically instructed to email the unique 14-digit access code on the back of each MoneyPak. With that code, anyone can ""unlock"" the card and transfer the money to another prepaid debit card either by going online or by calling an automated Green Dot phone line. To address this problem, GreenDot says it expects that by early next year, most stores will be able to let consumers add money directly onto an existing prepaid card by swiping the card through a machine connected to a Green Dot data-processing center. The new system, already in place in Walmart stores that sell Green Dot products, will render obsolete the kind of access codes presently on the back of every MoneyPak card. Customers will be charged the same $4.95 transaction fee as with a MoneyPak now. ""Reloading at the register not only is a great thing for honest customers, a side benefit is it eliminates all of these nefarious uses,"" said Steve Streit, chief executive of Green Dot, which went public in 2010. ""This will all be a thing of the past."" Green Dot's decision to retire its 14-digit MoneyPak product recently won praise from Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, in a July 16 hearing focused on fraudulent schemes against the elderly. But Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League, a nonprofit advocacy group, says she worries that cybercriminals will simply leapfrog from MoneyPaks to cash-transfer products offered by other prepaid card companies. She noted that the Vanilla Reload network, a subsidiary of InComm, offers a cash-transfer product that works similarly to MoneyPak. Ms. Greenberg said that her group received over the last year an increased number of complaints from consumers about frauds seeking payment with Vanilla prepaid cards. Representatives for InComm, a privately held company based in Atlanta, did not return requests for comment. The Vanilla Reload website says cards can be bought at ""thousands of stores nationwide."" The Federal Trade Commission said last year that Americans reported losing $42.86 million to schemes involving prepaid products. Regulators and consumer advocates say the true figure is probably much higher since many victims do not report being ripped off because of the difficulty in prosecuting such cases and the embarrassment of being duped. Green Dot's own internal estimate is that fraudulent schemes involving MoneyPaks cost consumers $30 million in 2013. Green Dot said that's a small number compared with the $10 billion in cash that customers added to either a MoneyPak or its new prepaid card with a swipe transaction last year. Over all, customers put $20 billion on all Green Dot products in 2013. Still, it's not just consumer scams that have concerned authorities. Last year, federal authorities charged Olivia Louise Bolles, a Delaware doctor who sold drugs on Silk Road, an online marketplace where drugs and weapons could be bought with virtual currencies, with using MoneyPaks to help conceal some of her ill-gotten proceeds. In the criminal complaint against Ms. Bolles, an agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration described MoneyPaks as a ""preferred method of payment for illegal money launders and persons wishing to transfer currency without triggering legal and reporting requirements."" MoneyPaks also played a pivotal role in drug-running scheme in the Maryland state prison system involving a gang called the Black Guerrilla Family. Federal authorities last year charged that gang members would send text messages containing the 14-digit access code to a MoneyPak to pay off corrections officers and others involved in the conspiracy to smuggle drugs into the prison. An online prostitution service based in North Carolina asked that patrons pay with MoneyPak. Consumers also report being less than satisfied with the way Green Dot responds to reports of fraud. Mr. Jones said when he called to complain about paying a fee to a company that did not deliver on writing him a loan, a Green Dot representative said there was nothing the company could do. Similarly, Ms. Stephens said Green Dot advised her to fill out a police report, but offered no other advice. ""They weren't very responsive,"" she said. A warning on the back of each MoneyPak tells consumers not to give out the 14-digit code to people or businesses they don't know. The company also tells consumers that Green Dot is not responsible if a person falls victim to a fraud. Mr. Streit, a former radio executive and disc jockey who founded Green Dot in 1999, said the company was committed to reducing fraud, noting that of Green Dot's 2,700 employees, about 200 work in its fraud detection division. Even so, Mr. Streit said he had been surprised at the number of scams involving the company's MoneyPak cards. ""It turns out bad guys like convenience as much as anyone else,"" he said. "
The C.I.A.'s Reckless Breach of Trust,"In March, John Brennan, the C.I.A. director, was indignant when Senator Dianne Feinstein charged that the agency had broken into computers used by staff investigators from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she leads. ''As far as the allegations of C.I.A. hacking into Senate computers,'' he said, ''nothing could be further from the truth. I mean, we wouldn't do that. I mean, that's just beyond the scope of reason.'' But reason seems to have little to do with the C.I.A.'s operations, as Mr. Brennan apparently discovered far too late. On Thursday, the Central Intelligence Agency admitted that it did, indeed, use a fake online identity to break into the Senate's computers, where documents connected to a secret report on the agency's detention and torture program were being stored. Mr. Brennan apologized privately to Ms. Feinstein and to Senator Saxby Chambliss, the vice chairman of the intelligence committee, and promised to set up an accountability board to determine who did the hacking and whether and how they should be punished.  The accountability and the apologies, however, will have to go much further. It's not just two senators that the C.I.A. has offended by this shocking action. It is all of Congress and, by extension, the American public, which is paying for an intelligence agency that does not seem to understand the most fundamental concept of separation of powers. That concept means that Congress is supposed to oversee the intelligence community and rein in its excesses. It cannot possibly do so effectively if it is being spied on by the spy agency, which is supposed to be directing its efforts against foreign terrorists and other threats to national security. The committee has been working since 2009 on a comprehensive history of the agency's antiterror program during the George W. Bush administration, which involved illegal rendition to other countries, detention, and torture of suspects, all producing little useful intelligence. It has been frustrated at many points by stonewalling from the agency, which provided misleading information, hid important facts inside a blizzard of excess documents, and forced endless delays in the declassification process. The 6,300-page report still has not been made public, though parts of it may be released later this month, and it is expected to undercut the Bush administration's claims that its actions were both legal and effective. Late last year, the agency suspected that Senate investigators had obtained an internal C.I.A. review of the torture program. Senate officials said the review was in a database they were allowed to see, but realized that the C.I.A. had broken into a private Senate computer server and found the review. A summary of an agency inspector general's report, released Thursday, said C.I.A. hackers even read the emails of Senate staffers. Then they exhibited a ''lack of candor'' to agency investigators. In an extraordinary speech on the Senate floor in March, Ms. Feinstein accused the agency of having ''undermined the constitutional framework essential to effective congressional oversight of intelligence activities or any other government function.'' The institutional affront even drew Republican criticism. If the charge was true, said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, ''heads should roll, and people should go to jail.'' One of those heads may need to be Mr. Brennan's. If he knew about the break-in, then he blatantly lied. If he did not, then apparently he was unaware of the lawless culture that has festered within the C.I.A. since the moment it was encouraged by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney to torture suspects and then lie about it. That recklessness extended to the point where agency officials thought nothing of burglarizing their own overseer. Senator Mark Udall of Colorado said the action was illegal and required the resignation of Mr. Brennan. The C.I.A. needs far more than a few quiet personnel changes, however. Its very core, and basic culture, needs a thorough overhaul. "
Google Gives Child Pornography Email Evidence to Police,"Federal law requires people and companies to report child exploitation when they see it. This includes Google, whose automated eyes tipped law enforcement about a Houston-area man whom the police say was using the company's Gmail service to email pornographic images of a child.  The man, John Henry Skillern, 41, was arrested and charged with promotion and possession of child pornography. According to the police, the arrest was set in motion when Google sent a tip to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. The group alerted David Nettles, a detective in Webster, Tex., who works full time for the Houston Metro Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. In an email, Mr. Nettles wrote: ""All I can say is that Google is bound by federal law to report child exploitation when they see it...Google sent what they found to NCMEC and that information is processed into a cybertip that was assigned to me. I get search warrants based on the tip and my further investigation and in this case charges were filed."" Google has repeatedly said that its users should not expect its free Gmail service to be private. They agree to as much when they sign up for the service, which includes ads based on key words in email. In legal documents, the company has compared web-based emails to a business letter that might be opened by the recipient's assistant. But Mr. Skillern's arrest highlights Google's immense power and leeway to scan users' email for all manner of content - not just the terms it uses to sell ads. Google can detect child pornography with a widely used digital fingerprinting system - called ""hashing"" - that allows companies and law enforcement to detect known child pornography in electronic services like Gmail. Google said it has been using hashing since 2008. ""Each child sexual abuse image is given a unique digital fingerprint, which enables our systems to identify those pictures, including in Gmail,"" a Google spokesman said in an email. ""It is important to remember that we only use this technology to identify child sexual abuse imagery, not other email content that could be associated with criminal activity (for example using email to plot a burglary)."" According to a report by KHOU-TV, Mr. Skillern was a cook at a Denny's restaurant in Pasadena, Tex. The report said that the police found video of children visiting the restaurant on his cellphone. Mr. Skillern is being held with bail set at $200,000, according to Business Insider. "
Why Leaked Nude Photos Are Another Frontier for Feminists,"""A trove of nude celebrity photos spread like wildfire across the Internet over Labor Day weekend,"" Mike Isaac writes for The New York Times. ""The photos, which included images of the actress Jennifer Lawrence and the model Kate Upton, became available after someone - and who did it is unknown - posted the pictures to 4chan and Reddit, two hugely popular anonymous online message boards."" The wave of leaks - including many female celebrities - unleashed a tsunami of sympathy, snark and condemnation. Todd VanDerWerff, writing for Vox, calls the hack ""a final rending of whatever illusions of personal life celebrities thought they had."" Mr. VanDerWerff draws a connection between the violation of celebrities' privacy with the vicious online attacks this summer of Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian.  Mr. VanDerWerff calls the ""common denominator"" in the varied cases ""angry men, often young, often with huge chips on their shoulders."" Neetzan Zimmerman, the editor in chief of Whisper, identified a similar tendency: Shades of Elliot Rodger in the terrifying mentions of nude pic leak victim @M_E_Winstead (via @scotchka): http://t.co/Bqd5kNNBbd - Neetzan Zimmerman (@neetzan)1 Sep 14 Others responded with resignation. Roxane Gay admonished readers at the Guardian not to be too surprised. ""Privacy is a privilege,"" Ms. Gay writes, ""little more than an illusion, one we create so we can feel less vulnerable."" We've long known that celebrities are afforded little privacy, but Ms. Gay argues that women rarely get to preserve their privacy. The leak reminds us that ""the further away you are from living as a white, heterosexual, middle-class man, the less privacy you enjoy."" Reddit has been criticized for not cracking down on links to the images. Rob Price at The Daily Dot explains that Reddit rules forbid the posting of ""person information"" - a prohibition that posting illegally obtained nude photographs seems to contravene. Erin Gloria Ryan at Jezebel points out the contradiction, often on display in Reddit threads, between preserving someone's privacy online and protecting free speech. These rights, she argues, ""are so often invoked in defending the actions of men trying to intimidate and humiliate women that I'm starting to think we've conflated 'free speech' with 'freedom to bully without consequences.'"" Kelsey McKinney, also writing for Vox, calls out Twitter users who lay the responsibility for the hack on celebrities. The idea that famous people should protect themselves by ceasing to take nude pictures of themselves, Ms. McKinney says, is akin to the ""victim-blaming arguments"" that criticize a woman who is sexually assaulted for wearing a short skirt. Exchanging sexually explicit messages has become a part of our culture, Ms. McKinney argues, and both women and men should be able to partake without being made to feel ashamed. Ms. McKinney writes that, if her phone were hacked, nude photos would be in the mix among her Liz Lemon GIFs and pictures of her dog. ""There are pictures on my phone that I am not ashamed of and that I took for someone I love as a form of sexual expression that was well within my rights."" Anne Helen Peterson at Buzzfeed advocates a similar approach to Ms. McKinney's. Ms. Peterson offers the story of Marilyn Monroe, who posed topless for $50 in 1949 only to have the images resurface in 1952, as a guideline for how Jennifer Lawrence should respond. ""Monroe reassured the public that posing for those photos wasn't wrong, or sinful, or something that should end her career - but a young, hungry, ambitious girl understanding her assets and sharing the pleasure of her beautiful body,"" writes Ms. Peterson. ""No image or activity is de facto scandalous; it only becomes scandalous when it compromises our understanding of how a star, or a political figure, or a teacher or a journalist or a clergyman, should behave."" Ms. Lawrence has already demonstrated her considerable sex appeal, argues Ms. Peterson, so she can sidestep any change to how she is perceived by incorporating them into ""the preexisting Lawrence image."" Amanda Hess, writing for Slate, disagrees. Ms. Lawrence never agreed to share these images; they were taken from her and shared without her consent. ""The last three words of that sentence are the crucial ones here,"" Ms. Hess writes. ""We should all be scandalized - by the hackers who committed this crime, by the institutions that have been too slow to fight them, and by the very idea that any woman should have to massage the circumstances of her victimization while dancing backward and in high heels."" Ms. Hess, like Ms. Gay, points out that posting naked pictures of women without their consent isn't confined to celebrities. If anything, such high-profile cases mask a common occurrence. Ms. Hess recalls the case of Christopher Chaney, a man who was prosecuted for hacking into the accounts of Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis. In 2012, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Mr. Chaney didn't target only celebrities, though; he also released photos, as Ms. Hess puts it, of ""two nonfamous women he knew personally."" The practice, Ms. Gay writes, is so common that it now has a name: ""revenge porn."" The attention drawn by Ms. Johansson and Ms. Kunis - and, arguably, by Ms. Hess's article in Pacific Standard about her own online harassment - helped secure legal recourse for lesser-known victims. Last year, California criminalized revenge porn. This year, several other states followed suit, and federal prosecutors are taking a new and aggressive approach to prosecuting ""emotional hacking."" What distinguishes this cache of nude celebrity photos is the volume of images that was released. As Jay Caspian Kang explains for The New Yorker, it's likely that there may be hundreds more images to come. Whether or not a woman should take measures to protect herself or stand proud before her persecutors, harassment is taking ever more unusual and threatening forms. Andy Cush reported at Gawker that r/TheFappening (""fap"" means masturbate), the Reddit thread dedicated to the photos, briefly became the top fund-raiser to the Prostate Cancer Foundation's current  campaign. The Prostate Cancer Foundation has since returned the funds, writing in a statement, ""We would never condone raising funds for cancer research in this manner."" Online communities will continue to be a forum for sexual harassment and violations of privacy. It remains to be seen how the law, and the Internet, might respond.                       "
Tianhe Chemicals Issues Rebuttal to Short-Seller Report,"HONG KONG - The head of a Chinese chemical company that was called a fraud last week in a short-selling research report responded on Thursday to what he said were ""falsified information and blatantly untrue statements.""  The comments by Xuan Wei, the chief executive of Tianhe Chemicals, were in response to a report published last week by Anonymous Analytics, a group that calls itself a faction of the hacking collective Anonymous. The report described Tianhe as ""one of the largest stock market frauds ever conceived."" Tianhe said late Wednesday that its email system had been hacked, possibly compromising the company's continuing discussions with the Hong Kong stock exchange over the allegations in the report. The company said it had decided to immediately issue the lengthy rebuttal, published on the website of the exchange. Trading in Tianhe's shares has been suspended since Sept. 2, when the report was released. The company has been listed only since June, when it raised about $650 million. ""The company unequivocally denies and vigorously refutes the groundless allegations in the report,"" Tianhe said in the filing. ""The authors of the report have concealed themselves behind a shroud of anonymity with no information on their identity or background or their purported expert sources."" The attack on Tianhe, which makes specialty lubricant additives, comes amid an increase in activity among short-sellers betting on a drop in the shares of Chinese companies. This week, Carson C. Block of Muddy Waters Research announced a new short position on 500.com, a Chinese sports gambling website listed on Nasdaq. On Wednesday, the Trinity Research Group, another short-selling research company, published a report taking aim at 21 Vianet Group, a Chinese Internet data center services company, also listed on Nasdaq. But the report on Tianhe is notable because of the company's size - a market value of about 59 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $7.6 billion - and its backers. Those include Morgan Stanley's Asian private equity unit, which invested $300 million in Tianhe in 2012. ""We stand resolutely behind Tianhe's world-class management team,"" Homer Sun, the chief investment officer of the Morgan Stanley unit and a nonexecutive director of Tianhe, said Thursday in a statement. Tianhe said it was still in discussions with the Hong Kong stock exchange - which doubles as the operator and a regulator of the city's market - about the Anonymous Analytics report when it discovered on Wednesday that someone had hacked into its email system. The company said it released the rebuttal publicly because it had determined there was ""an imminent risk of leakage of such communications which may result in further market rumors."" The shares remain suspended from trading, pending further discussions with the stock exchange. ""I intend to draw a line under this matter as quickly as possible, and move on to what is important - continuing to grow one of the world's leading specialty chemical groups,"" Mr. Wei, the chief executive, said in the filing.

Readers Debate Online Piracy and the Future of Digital Entertainment,"On Sunday, The New York Times published the story of a popular - and illegal - website that let people stream and download movies and television shows at their leisure. The site was taken offline in 2010 by the federal government, and the administrators behind the site were charged with conspiracy and copyright infringement. Nearly all served time in prison. The article touched a nerve among Times readers, eliciting hundreds of reactions about copyright infringement and intellectual property, and how the digital world complicates both. Here is a sampling of their comments:  One reader who identified himself as Art, from California, felt that cases like these were crucial for helping the entertainment industry consider adapting its business model to an on-demand, digital climate. He said:  ""The film and television industry's efforts to stop unauthorized online distribution of their product is like building a dam in the middle of a vast ocean. They instead need to invest resources to bring their business model up to date, taking into account how their audience wants entertainment to be made available and what price point will work. Like iTunes trumped peer-to-peer in music distribution: compete with free via convenience, dependability and value."" Some of our international readers, like Mark from Norway, described illegal downloading as an unfortunate reality of their daily lives, because the content is not yet available for legal viewing. He wrote:  ""For those of us not in the USA, mostly we are faced with 'that content is not available in your geographical area' messages. The truth is that it is available, just not legally. Either sell it to us or we will watch it anyway, for free and commercial free."" Claire, a reader from Los Angeles who said she works in the movie business, said Mark's attitude and approach may not put a dent in the wallets of the large movie studios, but does have an effect on the lower level workers in the industry: ""You're penalizing the little guys - meaning the writers, directors, actors, film scorers and anyone else who relies on residuals for their livelihood. Every time you stream illegally I don't get paid. Period."" Jessica Burstein agreed and cautioned against underestimating the long-ranging effects of illegal download and streaming: ""Having served on the National Executive Board of the International Cinematographers Guild and as the photographer for the first Anti-Piracy print campaign, I am well versed in the effects of such actions. On a practical level, every time there is theft of intellectual property in the entertainment industry, below-the-line crew member's jobs in this industry are being put at risk. People work very long and hard hours and their livelihoods depend on the money paid to the studios and networks who hire them."" A number of readers shared their thoughts on the criminal justice system and questioned the severity of the sentences and punishments given to Hana Beshara and others involved with the Web site, NinjaVideo. One reader noted:  ""While I don't support illegal activity, the public resources used to track these bootleggers is silly. Bankers committed huge scams that brought the economy of the U.S. crashing down all around us, yet not one of their homes were raided."" JHM, a reader from Taiwan, disagreed:  ""I am sure 20 years from now, at the most, we will have all accepted the fact that stealing something digital online is every bit as much a crime as shoplifting from a store. It may just take sending a few more Hana Besharas to prison to drive the point home.""                        "
On the Trail of an Online Pirate," Last Sunday Jenna Wortham, a technology reporter, profiled Hana Beshara, a founder of NinjaVideo, a now-shuttered streaming website. She discusses the challenge of tracking down Ms. Beshara, who served a prison term for her role in running the illegal site, and of describing a culture with a different understanding of copyright law.  I can't quite remember first time I saw NinjaVideo - maybe late 2008 or early 2009, not long after it launched - but I definitely remember my reaction: I was in total awe. The site was so flagrantly illegal, it felt almost anarchist and borderline punk rock - there was just such a total disregard for copyright law that I remember thinking, ""How is this site still up?"" Of course, that question was answered in 2010 when the federal government shut it down. But while it lived, it was a marvel of technology because it just worked.  While it was live, Damon Darlin, my editor at the time, encouraged me to find out who was behind it, but the idea got lost in the shuffle of daily responsibilities and assignments.  Then the site and its founders got raided, and the tech press jumped all over the story. I kicked myself for not looking into it sooner, and obsessively followed all the news about the case and proceedings as they progressed. Other journalists, including Natasha Tiku at The Observer, Ernesto at TorrentFreak - a blog that follows news about piracy - and The American Prospect took up the story, but I felt like there would still be room to revisit it a few years later to gauge whether the government's decision - to lock up a bunch of 20-something kids for running an illegal streaming site - had effectively achieved its goal of snuffing out illegal downloading online. I first reached out to Ms. Beshara, one of the figures behind the site, in June 2013. She had recently been released from prison and I emailed Ernesto, of TorrentFreak, to see if he could put me in touch. A few days later, I heard from Candee, one of the site's former moderators, and she said Ms. Beshara wouldn't be able to talk to me until she had completed the home detention portion of her sentence. I waited a few months, and finally, in October, Ms. Beshara emailed me. It took another few months to actually talk - we Skyped while she worked in a coffee shop co-op as part of her court-ordered community service - and I was struck by how familiar she seemed; how much she could have been someone I knew or interacted with. I only wish I had also been able to interview the technical administrators behind the site, but I was not able to connect with them before the piece ran. Writing about something as controversial as online piracy, particularly at a moment when the company I work for is navigating the transition to a subscription-based business model, is a challenge unto itself. It's an area that many people passionate about - as evidenced by all the comments we received on the story. I tried to get readers - particularly older readers and those who work in the entertainment business - to understand a perspective that is so unlike their own and instead see it as a reflection of the world we now live in. I wanted them to question whether the laws are nuanced and complex enough to address the changes they govern. I'm not sure I was entirely successful! I am familiar with the world Ms. Beshara and her cohorts inhabited. I came of age before Netflix/Hulu/iTunes were in full effect and when illegal streaming networks like Napster, Demonoid and Kazaa were proto-social networks. Talking about the music you were downloading was an icebreaker; it was part of the social fabric in high school and college. Even after those services got shut down, I noticed that the habits remained. Friends of mine share their Amazon, Netflix and HBO login information freely and loan each other their Kindles so they can read the books on them. It's endlessly fascinating to observe how our views about sharing, digital property and ownership evolve, and the relationship between consumers and the law and copyright owners is endlessly fascinating. I now pay for nearly all the content I consume, but I never lost interest in that world and the people who operate in it. "
Links to Photos Said to Be Stolen From Snapchat Users Flood Message Boards,"Members of anonymous online message boards claim to have accessed hundreds of thousands of private photographs shared on Snapchat, a popular photo sharing service, just weeks after a celebrity hacking scandal drew increased attention to online privacy concerns. But the photos do not appear to have come directly from Snapchat. Instead, the collection of photos of noncelebrities, which some claim is as big as 200,000, appear to have come from the accounts of people using Snapsaved, a smartphone tool that its creators said would allow users to store photos from their Snapchat accounts that normally disappear after 10 seconds.  At least one person on the anonymous online messaging forum 4chan claimed to have accessed Snapsaved's storage servers to gain access to the photos, saying links to allow anyone to download the images would be posted online. News of the photos began circulating widely after Kenny Withers, a social media strategist from Vancouver, Wash., began blogging about the message board discussions. Snapsaved itself is a bit of a mystery. It is not affiliated with Snapchat and it is not immediately clear who created it. The web address for Snapsaved.com does not appear to be working. Earlier, it was redirecting traffic to an obscure e-commerce site. It also does not appear that Snapsaved was ever available on the Google Play app store and in order to use it, users would have had to go directly to the Snapsaved site - something Google strongly discourages because of security concerns. The Internet address Snapsaved.com was registered on Oct. 17, 2013, and was set to expire on Oct. 17, 2014 - next week. There was no response to an email sent to a Facebook account for Snapsaved, which was created a week after the domain name was registered. The Facebook page has not been updated since March 2014. The registrant of an Internet address can typically be identified through what is called a ""Who is"" search. But the registrant of Snapsaved.com used a service meant to conceal the identity of an address's owner. Questions arose as to which application was the origin of the alleged theft. In a footnote at the bottom of Snapsaved.com, the creator of the site listed it as SnapSave Online Inc. 2013, which is similar to another app with an almost identical name: Snapsave. Georgie Casey, the creator of Snapsave, said that no photos had come from his service, and directed queries to Snapsaved. ""My app just saves Snaps to your Android phone, nothing is ever sent to my server,"" Mr. Casey said. A week before the Snapsaved.com website was registered, a number of news sites wrote about Mr. Casey's app and another, similar app. Snapchat said on Friday that, if the cache of photos was real, they did not come from Snapchat. ""We can confirm that Snapchat's servers were never breached and were not the source of these leaks,"" a Snapchat spokeswoman said in a statement. ""Snapchatters were victimized by their use of third-party apps to send and receive Snaps, a practice that we expressly prohibit in our Terms of Use precisely because they compromise our users' security."" ""We vigilantly monitor the App Store and Google Play for illegal third-party apps and have succeeded in getting many of these removed,"" she added. The allegations come not long after a group of hackers stole private photos from a number of celebrity accounts on Apple, and used online web forums like 4chan and Reddit to distribute the stolen content. Apple faced intense criticism in the wake of the theft. The actress Jennifer Lawrence, one of the celebrities whose photos were stolen, called the acts ""a sex crime."" News of the stolen Snapchat photos spread over the past week, as an unidentified 4chan member claimed to have obtained the photos, saying links to access them would be released late Thursday evening. Mr. Casey of Snapsave said he had been wary of the Snapsaved site when he first saw it. ""I came across it first around April 2014 and it had something like 100 Facebook likes,"" Mr. Casey said. ""I assumed no users would be stupid enough to enter their log-ins on a random website, but your average Snapchat user isn't very tech savvy."" "
Dimon Calls for Help on Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON - Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, made his first public comments about thecyberattack on the bank, referring to the summer breach a ""big deal"" and calling for help from the government in dealing with these kinds of issues.  Mr. Dimon made his remarks on Friday at a conference organized by the Institute of International Finance, the global banking lobby. It was also the first time he had spoken publicly since the companydisclosed that he was being treated for throat cancer last summer. Mr. Dimon, who spoke on a panel with his peers from Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America, appeared to be his usual, feisty self. He talked up the strength of the United States economy (""I am a long-term bull""), took a mild - for him - swipe at global regulators (""we need a level global playing field"") and highlighted his message for employees in terms of keeping the bank out of trouble (""treat your clients the way you treat your friends and parents.') As for the cyberattack, which affected 76 million households, Mr. Dimon emphasized that the financial industry and banks on Wall Street needed to keep working together to prevent other such occurrences. JPMorgan, he said, was spending $250 million a year on the issue - a sum likely to double in four to five years. He also pointed out that JPMorgan was not the only bank to have this problem. ""This is going to be a big deal and there will be a lot of battles,"" he said. ""We need a lot of help."" Mr. Dimon's appearance at the banker conference was brief. Following the luncheon panel, he lingered briefly among a swarm of well wishers and then strode quickly through the crowd and left the building.

A Look Behind the Snapchat Photo Leak Claims,"Snapchat, a fast-growing Internet messaging service, promises its users that the things they share with each other will disappear within 10 seconds. But three men claim they wanted to prove that wasn't quite true, ""just for the fun of it."" So about a year ago they created Snapsaved.com, a web tool that when connected to a Snapchat account would save a user's photos and videos in an online storage locker. Then, last week, they said their experiment went haywire when their servers were breached. A handful of people on the online message board 4chan claimed to have access to a huge stash of private photos, including potential child pornography, stolen from Snapsaved.com. ""Of course we're very sorry,"" one of the men said in an interview. ""This whole thing was blown up beyond what we expected. We haven't profited from this, and we don't want to be famous.""  The men, who spoke English with Northern European accents, would not disclose their names, ages or location, saying only that they were somewhere outside the United States. The New York Times contacted them last Friday through Snapsaved's Facebook page.  They agreed to talk over an Internet phone connection but went to considerable effort to conceal their identities: They used a random name generation program to create their online handle, ""Schmidt Gizi,"" and claimed to be using so-called proxy computer servers to hide their location. Trucks could be heard in the background during the conversation, indicating that they were most likely outside. They have taken Snapsaved offline. Just how links to the photos from Snapsaved surfaced on message boards is still a mystery and the men said they did not know who was responsible. The size of the collection of stolen photos is also hard to pin down. Posters on 4chan claim they stole around 200,000 images. But the men who say they created Snapsaved said that the stolen collection had more like 40,000 and that hackers had inflated the total with pictures from pornography sites. Indeed, it is even impossible to say for certain if the links to images making the rounds on message boards are really from Snapchat, though the men who say they created Snapsaved said they had seen the stash of photos and believe they were taken from their own servers. The incident has raised new questions regarding Snapchat, which is particularly popular among teenagers. Security researchers say that while any dedicated hacker with enough time and resources can find a way to tap into Snapchat, the company could make it harder for third-party services like Snapsaved. ""But with enough motivation, it doesn't matter, it'll still be reverse-engineered,"" said Adam Caudill, an independent security researcher and outspoken Snapchat critic. ""The issue with them is that their users expect more privacy than they can provide, and the nature of the service has made it more of a target than most."" Snapchat has faced past criticism regarding its promises of privacy. Last year, security experts publicly revealed a flaw in the company's technology, which Snapchat quickly dismissed. Days later, the service was hacked to expose the handles and phone numbers of thousands of Snapchat users. Many take issue with Snapchat's privacy claims. The Electronic Privacy Information Center has asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into Snapchat's data security practices. In May, Snapchat settled with the F.T.C. and agreed to further improve its privacy features over time. The three men contacted through the Snapsaved Facebook page provided The Times with a list of Snapchat user names collected from Snapsaved.com to prove they were affiliated with Snapsaved.com.  A number of those user names matched the names of people who commented on Snapsaved.com's Facebook page and indicated on that page that they had signed up for the service. A random sampling of about 40 names on the list also matches the names of Snapchat users. They said they built the site in October 2013 after they were hired by someone they met on BlackHatWorld.com, an online message board where users trade tips and swindles to make money off search engines using practices that are typically rejected by companies like Google. This person, whom the men would not identify but said was based in Hong Kong, owned the Snapsaved.com domain listing or Internet address. The men tried to contact this man after the hack, but he did not respond to them. Snapsaved acted as a sort of online middleman between Snapchat and individual users. After a person entered a Snapchat handle and password, any photos or images sent to friends were saved to Snapsaved's server. Over the past year, the men said they had collected about 13 gigabytes of photos and data from more than 260,000 users. That means that even if a Snapchat user did not use Snapsaved.com, that person's photos may still be at risk if they were sent to someone who had gained access to the site. The men were alerted that something was wrong only after the first news reports began to circulate last week. They claimed two different people hacked into the Snapsaved.com server, and were able to steal 415 megabytes of data. The stolen content only includes photos and videos, these men said, and not user names, phone numbers, passwords or other account information. After realizing their server had been breached, the men said they deleted all of the photos and took down the website. The men said they decided to talk because they wanted to make it clear that it was their site that was hacked - not Snapchat. And they also wanted to make clear that they did not intend to collect child pornography. But six months ago, that is what happened. The men said they found images of child pornography uploaded to the Snapsaved.com server. They said they were able to trace the Internet addresses of the users sharing those photos to Sweden and Norway and sent that material to child protective services in those countries. Snapchat has said that what Snapsaved did is an unauthorized use of its service, and condemns the practice. On Tuesday, Snapchat posted an update to its blog, warning users not to obtain access to third-party services that have tied into its service without permission. ""When you give your login credentials to a third-party application, you're allowing a developer, and possibly a criminal, to access your account information and send information on your behalf,"" the company said in its blog post.  Snapchat says it is not averse to working with partners and hopes to do more of that, but it does not invite them to reverse-engineer its service in order to find and exploit its flaws. For now, the men responsible for Snapsaved.com have not gone to the authorities to talk about the incident. They said they were concerned for their safety, and worried they would be prosecuted for storing or inadvertently distributing the photos. And yet, since The Times interviewed them over the weekend, they have shown some signs of bravado, even asking to be paid in Bitcoin - the online currency - in exchange for an interview, according to Motherboard, Vice's technology site. The Times did not pay for its interview. ""Well ... my time is finite, and the amount of interviewers is very high, we have made a public statement, explaining our side of the story,"" one of the men said in a Facebook message on Tuesday. ""If you wish further elaboration on the topic, we can give you that, but we are very busy at the moment.""                       "
The Hacktivist as Angry Young Man,"THE HACKER WARS Opens on Friday Directed by Vivien Lesnik Weisman 1 hour 31 minutes; not rated Making no pretense of balance or objectivity, Vivien Lesnik Weisman's excitable documentary ''The Hacker Wars'' is a forceful indictment of the United States government's surveillance and prosecution of computer hackers and journalists.  Surveying four main legal actions, including the one against Andrew Auernheimer, a.k.a. Weev, who embarrassed AT&T by revealing weaknesses in its security systems, Ms. Weisman offers a deluge of information. But for those not already versed in the lingo or the people involved, the movie plays like a blurry primer to an anarchic, mysterious world. Hyperkinetic editing and an overabundance of montage are no help as we watch fuzzy faces in grainy video and listen to mumbled words on poor, sometimes subtitled recordings. Interviewees like the journalist and lawyer Glenn Greenwald and the National Security Agency whistle-blower Thomas A. Drake provide respite from the flurry of acronyms and uninhibited commenters. Around two-thirds of the way in, however, the film catches hold, as the disturbing claims of its subjects -- mostly unsubstantiated but nevertheless persuasive -- accumulate and clarify. In particular, the complicated cases of the journalist Barrett Brown (who, at one point, faced more than 100 years in prison on a variety of charges) and the hacker Jeremy Hammond (who recently began serving a 10-year prison term) raise such troubling issues of mass surveillance and data collection that they deserve far greater depth and detail. With its insider feel and clear bias, ''The Hacker Wars'' does itself no favors in reaching a wider audience. Yet the behavior it scrutinizes speaks to the essence of democracy and the very definition of citizenship, and, as such, it merits a calmer, more reasoned forum than this one. "
Facebook Sues Lawyers for Pressing Dubious Fraud Case,"The last thing we do, let's sue all the lawyers. That, in essence, is what Facebook's chief executive and principal founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has decided to do in the dormant case of Paul Ceglia, an upstate New York entrepreneur who claimed in 2010 that Mr. Zuckerberg had struck an agreement with him in Facebook's early days to give him a substantial stake in the company. Mr. Ceglia's lawsuit seeking a multibillion-dollar stake in Facebook was dismissed by a federal judge amid substantial evidence that he had fabricated the documents purportedly supporting his claim, and prosecutors filed criminal fraud charges against him in 2012 that were still pending.  Facebook had insisted that the evidence was bogus and was suing many of Mr. Ceglia's lawyers,. including DLA Piper, one of the world's largest law firms. saying that they knew his claims were false but pursued the case in hopes of extracting a hefty settlement from Facebook. In its suit, filed Monday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg said that Mr. Ceglia's multifirm legal team continued to press the case even after one of his law firms discovered evidence on Mr. Ceglia's computer that indicated his claims were false and informed all of his other lawyers. The social networking company and Mr. Zuckerberg are seeking unspecified damages in the case. ""The lawyers representing Ceglia knew or should have known that the lawsuit was a fraud - it was brought by a convicted felon with a history of fraudulent scams, and it was based on an implausible story and obviously forged documents. In fact, Defendants' own co-counsel discovered the fraud, informed the other lawyers, and withdrew. Despite all this, Defendants vigorously pursued the case in state and federal courts and in the media,"" Facebook said in its suit. The law firm that discovered the fraud, Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman, initially planned to tell the court of the fraud, Facebook said, but one of Mr. Ceglia's other firms persuaded it to keep silent on the reasons for the firm's withdrawal. Eventually, the other firms withdrew, but never disclosed why, which Facebook said forced it to continue defending against Mr. Ceglia's claims until this March, when a federal court dismissed Mr. Ceglia's case against Facebook and allowed the criminal prosecution against him to proceed. Mr. Ceglia's criminal trial is scheduled for May, and he has appealed the dismissal of his claims against Facebook. In addition to DLA Piper and lawyers at the firm, Facebook is seeking damages from Paul Argentieri, Mr. Ceglia's original lawyer, and lawyers at Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman and Milberg L.L.P. One of the lawyers named as a defendant is Dennis C. Vacco, a former New York attorney general. Why did Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg file this case when the underlying claims by Mr. Ceglia have been thoroughly discredited and the whole matter has faded into a distant memory? The company said it's a matter of principle. ""We said from the beginning that Paul Ceglia's claim was a fraud and that we would seek to hold those responsible accountable,"" Facebook's general counsel, Colin Stretch, said in a statement. ""DLA Piper and the other named law firms knew the case was based on forged documents yet they pursued it anyway, and they should be held to account."" "
What Do We Know About Online Harassment?,"A survey released by the Pew Research Center on Wednesday offers some insight into harassment online. But will it help us fix the problem? The survey found that while men were more likely than women to be harassed on the Internet - 44 percent reported some form of harassment, compared with 37 percent of women - women were more likely to be sexually harassed or stalked. And women between the ages of 18 to 24 were especially vulnerable - 26 percent said they'd experienced stalking online, and 25 percent said they'd experienced sexual harassment. At The Atlantic, Jake Swearingen interprets the results thus:  ""The findings evoke the axiom, widely attributed to Margaret Atwood: 'Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.' Men, on the whole, report higher rates of less severe types of harassment (with the exception of physical threats), while women are more likely to be the focus of the two most frightening forms of it: sexual harassment and stalking."" But, he says, it doesn't have to be this way: ""Human behavior - and the limits placed on it by both law and society - can change."" He talks to Danielle Citron, a law professor and the author of ""Hate Crimes in Cyberspace,"" who notes that workplace sexual harassment, once dismissed as ""flirting,"" is now taken much more seriously. The same could happen for online harassment - Mr. Swearingen writes: ""The expansion of laws like the one currently on the books in California, which expands what constitutes online harassment, could help put the pressure on harassers. The upcoming Supreme Court case, Elonis v. The United States, looks to test the limits of free speech versus threatening comments on Facebook."" But, he adds, ""there are limits to legal action"" - and social pressure may have to pick up where the law leaves off. He writes, ""Sexual harassment in the workplace has been greatly reduced not just because employers are suddenly liable - there's also a huge social stigma against those who sexually harass their co-workers."" Sexual harassment at work isn't a solved problem - recent surveys of scientists in the field and of restaurant workers provide disturbing evidence to the contrary. But it is, at least, frequently discussed. And while, as Nick Wingfield notes in The New York Times's Bits blog, online harassment has gotten more coverage recently, this is the first time Pew researchers have looked at the topic. Some say more information is part of the solution. Zach Miners at PC World reports: ""Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, says Internet companies must be more transparent and provide users with information about the number of harassment reports they receive. 'Sunshine is a very good disinfectant,' she said."" And at Slate, Amanda Hess argues that research on the issue needs to get more specific: ""Pew did not define terms like 'offensive names,' 'physically threatened,' 'stalked,' 'sexually harassed,' 'harassed for a sustained period,' or 'purposefully embarrass' in its interviews. (What's the difference between being stalked and 'harassed for a sustained period?') The survey questions were often devoid of context: Eighteen percent of users said they believed online dating sites to be more 'welcoming to women' than men, but were they referring to the likelihood of women actually getting a response on these sites (high) and not considering the probability of women getting harassed in the process (also high)? It's impossible to know."" She notes that respondents' conceptions of harassment seemed to vary widely: ""One was 'told that if I stopped communicating with this man he would find me and rape me'; another reported that 'any feminist who doesn't already know me has been quick to characterize me as a privileged, misogynistic rape apologist.' Is being called a rape apologist the same as being threatened with rape? No, but it's all harassment here."" And, she concludes: ""What the Pew study does show is that the internet is producing a lot of garbage, and men and women are served different flavors. Understanding exactly how that works will require better definitions, but also more dedicated study."" The Pew survey arrives at a moment of intense public conversation around online behavior. But in order for that conversation to progress, Ms. Hess argues, it may need better vocabulary.                       "
State Dept. Targeted by Hackers in 4th Agency Computer Breach,"The State Department on Sunday became the fourth government agency to announce a breach of its computer systems in recent weeks, after an infiltration forced the agency to temporarily shut down its unclassified email system and public websites.  The breach, which the agency said did not affect any of its classified systems, follows a similar one involving the unclassified computer systems of the White House last month, which also resulted in a temporary shutdown of its communications systems. There have been similar breaches at the United States Postal Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It was not immediately clear if the attacks were related. The State Department breach was first reported Sunday by The Associated Press. ''This has impacted some of our unclassified email traffic and our access to public websites from our main unclassified system,'' said one senior State Department official, adding that the department expected its systems to be up soon. While the attack at the White House was quickly contained, the breach at the Postal Service, reported last week, compromised a database containing telephone numbers and email addresses of customers who contacted the agency's call center between January and mid-August. Security experts say hackers are probing government agencies to understand what kind of data is accessible. But it remains a matter of debate whether the attacks are related, and the exact identities of the intruders remain uncertain, officials say. The breach at the White House was believed to be the work of hackers in Russia, while the breaches at NOAA and the Postal Service were believed to the work of hackers inside China. Attributing attacks to a group or nation is difficult because hackers typically tend to route their attack through compromised web servers all over the world. A senior State Department official said the breach was discovered after ''activity of concern'' was detected on portions of its unclassified computer system. Officials did not say how long hackers may have been lurking in those systems, but security improvements were being added to them on Sunday. "
Hacker Disrupts Government Websites in Canada,"OTTAWA -- Since Friday, people turning to the websites of Canada's Parliament, its Supreme Court, the city of Ottawa and the Ottawa and Toronto police forces have been occasionally greeted by a gyrating, anthropomorphic banana or, more frequently, an error message.  The disruptions were prompted by a hacker or a small group of hackers supporting the cause of an Ottawa teenager who was charged last spring with making hoax telephone calls throughout North America. The calls led the police in a number of provinces and states to send out tactical squads in response to supposed emergencies, a practice known as swatting. Using the name Aerith, with slight variations, the hacker claimed responsibility for the website disruptions in emails and a posting online. The sender claimed to be affiliated with the shadowy online collective Anonymous. When asked by email how many people were involved, Aerith, who said that he or she was in Brazil, replied, ''We act as a group.'' At some point in the past few weeks, the hacker contacted the family of the Ottawa teenager, who cannot be identified under Canadian law, claiming to have information that would vindicate him. The youth was charged with 60 criminal counts related to the episodes after an investigation by Canadian police forces and the F.B.I. During a weekend news conference, the boy's father said he discovered what he described as law enforcement eavesdropping equipment hidden in compact fluorescent light bulbs in his home, based on information provided by the hackers. Neither the father nor the hacker, however, has released any of the information that they say will show the teenager was falsely accused. Along with the banana, which first appeared on Ottawa's municipal website on Friday, Aerith posted statements denouncing the city's police and provided personal information about the lead investigator and the city's police chief. The hacker did not knock down every site. A spokesman for the Supreme Court said it temporarily shut down its site as a protective measure. The site failures varied considerably in length. A memo to House of Commons employees said that its site was down for five minutes. The Ottawa Police Service website went down over the weekend and was still out of service late Monday afternoon. The city's site, which had recovered, was again briefly out of service late in the day on Monday. Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University in Montreal who studies Anonymous and other hackers said this hacker did not appear to be involved with the larger group. She said that usually a broad group of hackers would soon join in with attacks and other gestures of support. ''This is not what happened here,'' she said. ''He doesn't seem to have gained any kind of support from existing groups.'' "
Chief Justice Samples Eminem in Online Threats Case,"WASHINGTON -- As the Supreme Court on Monday tried to puzzle out what threats may be prosecuted as crimes, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. cited an unlikely source: the rapper Eminem. Treading gingerly, the chief justice quoted vivid lyrics from '' '97 Bonnie and Clyde,'' in which Eminem seems to threaten to drown his wife. ''Could that be prosecuted?'' Chief Justice Roberts asked Michael R. Dreeben, a government lawyer.  Mr. Dreeben said no and started to say something about context. Chief Justice Roberts interrupted. ''Because Eminem said it instead of somebody else?'' he asked. The case before the justices also involved threatening rap lyrics arising from domestic troubles. They were posted on Facebook by Anthony Elonis, a Pennsylvania man who had adopted the rap persona Tone Dougie. The posts, long tirades in the form of rap lyrics, were punctuated by brutally violent language, most of it directed against his estranged wife. He wrote that he would like to see a Halloween costume that included his wife's ''head on a stick.'' He talked about ''making a name for myself'' with a school shooting, saying, ''Hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a kindergarten class.'' He fantasized about killing an F.B.I. agent. Some of the posts contained disclaimers or indications that they aspired to be art or therapy. At Mr. Elonis's trial, his estranged wife testified that she understood the posts as threats. ''I felt like I was being stalked,'' she said. ''I felt extremely afraid for mine and my children's and my family's lives.'' Mr. Elonis was convicted under a federal law that makes it a crime to communicate ''any threat to injure the person of another.'' He was sentenced to 44 months. John P. Elwood, a lawyer for Mr. Elonis, said his client's posts included elements of entertainment. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. responded warily. ''This sounds like a road map for threatening a spouse and getting away with it,'' Justice Alito said. ''You put it in rhyme and you put some stuff about the Internet on it and you say, 'I'm an aspiring rap artist.' And so then you are free from prosecution.'' The Supreme Court has said that ''true threats'' are not protected by the First Amendment, but it has not been especially clear about what counts as such a threat. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the term itself was unhelpful. ''I'm not sure that the court did either the law or the English language much of a good service when it said 'true threat,' '' he said. ''It could mean so many things.'' The question for the justices in Monday's case, Elonis v. United States, No. 13-983, was whether prosecutors had done enough to prove Mr. Elonis's intent. Mr. Dreeben, the government lawyer, said the words and their context were enough. The standard proposed by the government, he said, would hold people accountable ''for the ordinary and natural meaning of the words that they say in context.'' Mr. Elwood said more was required. Ideally, he said, prosecutors should have to prove that the speaker's purpose was to threaten someone. Failing that, he said, prosecutors should at least have to prove that the speaker, whatever his or her purpose, knew ''that it's a virtual certainty'' that someone would feel threatened. The lower courts sided with Mr. Dreeben, the government lawyer. All the prosecution had to prove, the trial judge ruled, was that a ''reasonable person'' would foresee that others would view statements ''as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury or take the life of an individual.'' ''This is distinguished,'' the judge said, ''from idle or careless talk, exaggeration, something said in a joking manner or an outburst of transitory anger.'' Monday's argument was mostly about calibrating and articulating the right level of intent, and it seemed that many of the justices were looking for something between mere negligence and purposeful conduct. There was perhaps the beginning of a consensus that it would be enough to require prosecutors to prove that Mr. Elonis had been subjectively aware that his posts would scare and disturb his wife. The court could ground such a ruling in the First Amendment or in interpreting the federal law on threats, though the latter seemed more likely. But some justices seemed nervous about placing too stringent a burden on prosecutors. ''How does one prove what's in somebody else's mind?'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked. ''In this case, the standard was 'Would a reasonable person think that the words would put someone in fear?' and reasonable people can make that judgment. But how would the government prove whether this threat in the mind of the threatener was genuine?'' That echoed Mr. Dreeben, who insisted that the proper standard was an objective one that looked to what a reasonable person would have understood in the circumstances. Chief Justice Roberts tried to refine the point. ''Is it a reasonable person?'' he asked. ''Or is it a reasonable teenager on the Internet?'' There was laughter, and then Mr. Dreeben responded. ''If there is such a thing,'' he said. "
Minimizing In-Store Shopping Dangers,"Although many consumers worry about the risks of shopping online, in-store payment systems can be just as vulnerable as online checkouts. Swiping your credit or debit card could be exposing you to hackers and theft just as easily as entering a card number on a website. In last year's huge Target breach, stolen credentials from at least 40 million customers were pilfered from the store's payment system.  And Home Depot's cash register system was the weak point in a breach this year that exposed the data of some 56 million cardholders. But don't despair; there are ways to minimize the dangers when you're shopping in stores and to make your purchasing more secure. The safest way you can shop, of course, is with cash. It requires no sharing of personal data whatsoever - it's the most anonymous transaction you can make. But cash comes without some other protections: If someone steals the item you just bought as you're walking out the door, or you drop and break it a few days after purchase, you're probably out of luck. Many credit cards offer some sort of purchase protection that can reimburse you for stolen or damaged items. The coverage isn't usually comprehensive, but check your card's benefits and you may find that some items are covered up to 30 or even 90 days. And as it turns out, using your credit card when shopping in a store is relatively risk-free, at least for consumers. Many credit cards, for example, offer zero liability if the card is used to makes unauthorized purchases. That means if your credit card number is stolen from a store database, as happened to Target and Home Depot, you shouldn't have to pay if someone buys items with that card. ""So the thing to do to protect yourself from in-store shopping breaches is to use your credit card and know that retailers are paying much closer attention than they were a year ago,"" said Jason Oxman, the chief executive of the Electronic Transactions Association, a trade group that represents the payments industry. Debit cards come with greater risks: If that number is stolen and you don't realize it, you could end up being liable for quite a lot of money - even all the money in your account. Of course, having a compromised credit card number and getting a new card can be a headache. You may have to change the default card number across multiple online accounts, and you risk having payments declined and potential collections problems. And the ramifications of a stolen card can extend beyond the trouble of having to get a new card and change your default payment method on various sites and services. Stolen credentials can be tied to an email address, and that could allow hackers to send sophisticated phishing attacks, like an email that appears to be from your bank and may trick you into a clicking a link and typing in your banking password. If you're worried about credit card security, call your bank and ask whether it offers computer chip-based, or E.M.V. cards, instead of the old magnetic-stripe cards. These cards are more secure than stripe cards. Instead of sending your credit card number when you swipe, the chip generates a different security code for every transaction. And a PIN code acts as a second layer of security to prevent someone from using a stolen chip card. Credit card issuers are pushing for a transition to E.M.V. cards by October 2015, so many of them may already offer chip-based cards and will replace yours upon request. If your card issuer doesn't offer chip cards, consider switching to a card that has one, like the Chase Sapphire card. However, be aware that many retailers don't yet accept chip cards, so it's not a perfect solution. Another way to keep your credit card number out of the equation is to use Apple Pay or another electronic payments service like Google Wallet or SoftCard. Like chip-based credit cards, Apple Pay and its competitors don't send your credit card number to a store's database when you use it for a purchase. Instead, they send a secure, one-time code to authorize the purchase. Apple Pay or Google Wallet are especially good options for people who like to shop with their debit cards. They protect the card number but still let you shop with the equivalent of cash, but without carrying it all the time. Keep in mind, though, that not all stores accept these forms of payment. Store breaches continue to happen - the latest retailer to report a big hack was Staples, although officials estimate that more than 1,000 businesses could have been affected by the same hack that took down the Target and Home Depot systems. But as systems like chip-based credit cards and mobile wallet payments proliferate, credit and especially debit cards may be less vulnerable in time.                       "
Film Executives Apologize for Racially Tinged Emails,"LOS ANGELES -- Embarrassing, racially tinged emails about President Obama's imagined movie tastes, posted online by hackers and reported by news sites, prompted public apologies on Thursday from Sony Pictures Entertainment's movie chief and one of its top producers. ''To anybody I've offended, I'm profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused,'' the film producer Scott Rudin said in a statement after the disclosure of his private email banter with Amy Pascal, Sony's co-chairwoman, about Mr. Obama and black-themed films. ''I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive -- and not funny at all.''  Ms. Pascal said in her own statement: ''The content of my emails to Scott were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am. Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.'' The email exchange in question, reported by BuzzFeed, took place before Ms. Pascal attended a breakfast for Mr. Obama that was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation. ''What should I ask the president at this stupid Jeffrey breakfast?'' Ms. Pascal asked Mr. Rudin in an opening query. She then speculated that she might ask if Mr. Obama liked ''Django Unchained,'' about a former slave. Mr. Rudin countered with a suggestion about ''12 Years a Slave,'' while Ms. Pascal suggested other films involving African-Americans. Finally, Mr. Rudin wrote: ''Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart.'' The email referred to a broad comedy, from Universal Pictures, that starred Mr. Hart and Ice Cube. Mr. Rudin, who has been a producer of films like ''Captain Phillips'' and ''The Social Network'' for Sony, added in his apology, first posted on Deadline.com, that ''private emails between friends and colleagues written in haste and without much thought or sensitivity, even when the content of them is meant to be in jest, can result in offense where none was intended.'' The emails were disclosed as part of a continuing dump of documents by hackers who attacked Sony's computer systems, beginning in late November. In a separate email exchange, also disclosed online, another Sony executive, Clint Culpepper, used harsh language in suggesting that the studio rebuff a salary demand from Mr. Hart, who has starred in several films for the company's Screen Gems unit, including a coming movie, ''The Wedding Ringer.'' ''I'm not saying he's a whore, but he's a whore,'' Mr. Culpepper wrote. Representatives of the studio did not comment on Mr. Culpepper's remarks. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hart directed a reporter seeking comment to an assertive post on his Instagram account. ''I will never allow myself to be taken advantage of,'' Mr. Hart wrote. ''I refuse to be broken.'' Also on Thursday, the Rev. Al Sharpton, in a statement, condemned the exchange between Ms. Pascal and Mr. Rudin as ''offensive, insulting'' and took further aim at Ms. Pascal, saying her comments reflected a ''troubling'' lack of diversity at her studio and others. People familiar with Sony's response to the attack, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, have said they expect to face further unauthorized disclosures in the days ahead.

The Sony Hack and the Yellow Press,"Aaron Sorkin is a screenwriter and playwright. ''Jolie a 'Spoiled Brat' From 'Crazyland,' '' says The New York Post. ''Shocking New Reveals From Sony Hack,'' says The Daily Beast. ''Sony's Hacked Emails Highlight Hollywood's Problems With Diversity,'' says The Huffington Post. ''You're Giving Material Aid to Criminals,'' say the rest of us.  LOS ANGELES THREE weeks ago Sony Pictures Entertainment was the victim of a massive cyberattack by an outlaw group calling itself the Guardians of Peace. They breached Sony's security and stole tens of thousands of internal documents and emails. Then they left a threat. The Guardians said they were going to make these private documents public if the studio went ahead with its planned release of ''The Interview,'' a comedy with Seth Rogen and James Franco in which the two are tasked by the Central Intelligence Agency to whack the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Then they left another threat, this one accompanied by violent and disturbing imagery. ''Not only you but your family will be in danger,'' read a message to all Sony employees. The Federal Bureau of Investigation won't say much, but it says the hack is sophisticated and backed by a lot of money. The Guardians just had to lob the ball; they knew our media would crash the boards and slam it in. First, salaries were published. Not by the hackers, but by American news outlets. Then came the emails. A squabble between the Sony executive Amy Pascal and the producer Scott Rudin, an inappropriate and racially charged exchange, an insulting critique of recent Adam Sandler movies, a new idea for the ''Spider-Man'' franchise. Published. Everywhere. Finally the media got serious. Not because no one gets more use out of the First Amendment than they do, and here was a group threatening to kill people for exercising it. Not because hackers had released Social Security numbers, home addresses, computer passwords, bank account details, performance reviews, phone numbers, the aliases used when high-profile actors check into hotels (a safety measure to keep stalkers away), and even the medical records of employees and their children. But because a stolen email revealed that Jennifer Lawrence was being undervalued. I'm not a disinterested third party. Much of the squabbling between Ms. Pascal and Mr. Rudin was about a movie that's about to begin shooting, ''Steve Jobs,'' for which I wrote the screenplay, so my name comes up from time to time. The widely published documents that were stolen include an email to Ms. Pascal in which I advocated going to Tom Cruise for the lead role (I did), a second email from one executive to another speculating that I'm broke (I'm fine) and a third that suggested that I might be romantically involved with a woman whose book I'm using as source material for a new script (I wish). And because I and two movies of mine get a little dinged up, I feel I have the credibility to say this: I don't care. Because the minor insults that were revealed are such small potatoes compared to the fact that they were revealed. Not by the hackers, but by American journalists helping them. It's not a proud day for Hollywood either. This is a town of powerful people -- leaders and risk-takers who create things that have the power to start and change conversations. So why has it been so awfully quiet out here? We create movie moments. Wouldn't it be a movie moment if the other studios invoked the NATO rule and denounced the attack on Sony as an attack on all of us, and our bedrock belief in free expression? If the Writers Guild and Directors Guild stood by their members? If the Motion Picture Association of America, which represents the movie industry in Washington, knocked on the door of Congress and said we're in the middle of an ongoing attack on one of America's largest exports? We're coming to the end of the first reel; it's time to introduce our heroes. I understand that news outlets routinely use stolen information. That's how we got the Pentagon Papers, to use an oft-used argument. But there is nothing in these documents remotely rising to the level of public interest of the information found in the Pentagon Papers. Do the emails contain any information about Sony breaking the law? No. Misleading the public? No. Acting in direct harm to customers, the way the tobacco companies or Enron did? No. Is there even one sentence in one private email that was stolen that even hints at wrongdoing of any kind? Anything that can help, inform or protect anyone? The co-editor in chief of Variety tells us he decided that the leaks were -- to use his word -- ''newsworthy.'' I'm dying to ask him what part of the studio's post-production notes on Cameron Crowe's new project is newsworthy. So newsworthy that it's worth carrying out the wishes of people who've said they're going to murder families and who have so far done everything they've threatened to do. Newsworthy. As the character Inigo Montoya said in ''The Princess Bride,'' I do not think it means what you think it means. So much for ever getting a good review from Variety again. And so much for our national outrage over the National Security Agency reading our stuff. It turns out some of us have no problem with it at all. We just vacated that argument. As a screenwriter in Hollywood who's only two generations removed from probably being blacklisted, I'm not crazy about Americans calling other Americans un-American, so let's just say that every news outlet that did the bidding of the Guardians of Peace is morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable. I know there's juicy stuff in the emails and I know some of us have been insulted and I know there's more to come. No one's private life can totally withstand public scrutiny. But this is much bigger than hurt feelings and banged-up egos. If you close your eyes you can imagine the hackers sitting in a room, combing through the documents to find the ones that will draw the most blood. And in a room next door are American journalists doing the same thing. As demented and criminal as it is, at least the hackers are doing it for a cause. The press is doing it for a nickel. "
Sony's International Incident: Making Kim's Head Explode,"TOKYO -- When Sony Pictures began casting last year for a new comedy to be called ''The Interview,'' early scripts included the assassination of a fictionalized North Korean ruler. It was not until auditions began that actors learned that the movie would portray something much more brazen: the violent killing of the actual leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un. Sony's executives now say they knew that basing a film on the assassination of a living national leader -- even a ruthless dictator -- had inherent risks. But the studio seems to have gotten much more than it bargained for by bankrolling what it hoped would be an edgy comedy. The still very-much-alive Mr. Kim, the leader of an isolated and unpredictable nuclear-armed nation, appears not to have been amused when the premise of the comedy became clear. North Korea branded the $40 million film, to be released on Dec. 25, ''an act of war'' and vowed a ''resolute and merciless response.''  Then, last month, hackers unleashed one of the most punishing cyberattacks on a major corporation in recent memory, pilfering private emails, detailed summaries of executive salaries, and even digital copies of several unreleased Sony films that they posted online. It remains a mystery who was responsible. Suspicion has fallen on Mr. Kim's Bureau 121, an elite cyberunit, or patriotic hackers. But experts say pro-North Korea messages left behind could be a ruse to cover the hackers' real tracks. What is clear is that by deciding to go ahead with the film, Sony stumbled into a geopolitical mess complete with all the elements of a Hollywood thriller: international intrigue, once imperious, now humiliated, film executives, strong-willed leading men and highly sophisticated cyberattackers. The studio's first miscalculation, film experts say, was in venturing beyond where big-budget moviemakers dared to go in the past. ''The gory killing of a sitting foreign leader is new territory for a big studio movie,'' said Jeanine Basinger, a professor of film studies at Wesleyan University. From early on, ''The Interview'' seemed to pit the sensibilities of filmmakers in the United States, where the portly North Korean leader with the cherubic looks has been a target of easy humor, against those of Sony executives in Japan, where he is reviled but taken deadly seriously. While many Americans seem to see North Korea as too distant to keep them awake at night, many Japanese see it as a very visible threat. Until three decades ago, North Korean agents occasionally snatched people off beaches in neighboring Japan to serve as Japanese-language teachers, and long-range North Korean rockets on test runs still fly ominously over Japan's main islands. Disturbed by North Korean threats at a time when his company was already struggling, Sony's Japanese chief executive, Kazuo Hirai, broke with what Sony executives say was a 25-year tradition. He intervened in the decision making of his company's usually autonomous Hollywood studio, Sony Pictures Entertainment. According to hacked emails published by other media and interviews with people briefed on the matter, he insisted over the summer that a scene in which Mr. Kim's head explodes when hit by a tank shell be toned down to remove images of flaming hair and chunks of skull. In the emails, he also asked that even the less bloody shot not be shown outside the United States. A final decision on how the assassination scene will be rendered in overseas release has not been made, a person briefed on the film's international roll out said Sunday. Hollywood films have mocked North Korea and its leaders before. In 2004, ''Team America: World Police,'' a feature film made with puppets, portrayed Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, as a lonely but sadistic despot who eventually turned into a cockroach. But with ''The Interview,'' from the casting calls onward, Sony studio executives in the United States seemed aware that they were treading into a sensitive new area. ''In the original version of the script that I got, it wasn't Kim Jong-un,'' Randall Park, who was cast in the role, told bloggers invited to the Vancouver set last year. ''But I was told right before my audition that it was going to be Kim Jong-un.'' Whether the switch reflected a possible alternate creative direction, or was the result of an effort to keep an incendiary element of the movie quiet, is unclear. A Sony spokesman declined to comment. But some in the film industry said the film's co-directors, Evan Goldberg and the actor Seth Rogen, were trying to push creative boundaries, and that Sony allowed them to do so in part to keep them from going to a rival studio. ''That was always the whole point,'' said one agent familiar with ''The Interview'' from its earliest stages, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preserve ties to Sony. ''Buried inside that comedy is a really sharp geopolitical satire.'' In the movie, two American journalists are recruited by the C.I.A. to kill the North Korean leader. Experts on North Korean society said that it would not be much of a surprise if the country was behind the hacking, which it appeared to delight in even as it denied involvement. ''In Korean culture, there is a real need to protect your leader's dignity,'' said Toshimitsu Shigemura, an expert on North Korea at Waseda University in Tokyo who believes that North Korea probably had at least an indirect hand in Sony's hacking woes. ''The North Korean leader's subordinates were probably desperate to make some sort of gesture, in order to both prove their loyalty and to save their own skins.'' (Mr. Kim, after all, had his own uncle executed in a struggle for power and is reported to maintain an extensive network of brutal gulags for those who displease him.) The hacked emails that have been published paint a picture of a corporation torn between trying to be respectful of artistic license, while also trying to prevent the film from being too inflammatory. After pressure from Mr. Hirai, the emails show, Amy Pascal, co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures, repeatedly pressed Mr. Rogen to soften ''The Interview's'' climactic assassination scene. ''You have to appreciate the fact that we haven't just dictated to you what it had to be,'' Ms. Pascal wrote in September to Mr. Rogen. ''Given that I have never gotten one note on anything from our parent company in the entire 25 years that I have worked for them.'' According to the emails and a person briefed on the matter, Mr. Hirai inserted himself into the film's editing after North Korean officials, apparently having seen promotional materials last summer, called the film ''an act of war.'' In one email, Mr. Hirai approves a newly altered assassination shot that had ''no face melting, less fire in the hair, fewer embers on the face and the head explosion has been considerably obscured by the fire.'' At one point in the tug of war over the script, Mr. Rogen weighed in with an angry email to Ms. Pascal. ''This is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy,'' he wrote. ''That is a very damning story.'' Other published emails and interviews show Michael Lynton, chief executive of Sony Pictures, stepping in to distance ''The Interview'' from its Japanese owner after North Korea's initial blowback last June. In particular, Mr. Lynton pushed staff members to remove the word ''Sony'' from promotional materials, including billboards and trailers, and from the end credit crawl. Sony also decided not to release the R-rated film in Asia, but executives at the studio said the decision had been made largely because crudely irreverent humor does not translate easily, particularly in the more culturally conservative societies in the region. Still, the studio was aware that the raw geopolitical content would make booking the film even more difficult, according to Sony executives interviewed in recent days who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of the discussion. Some analysts speculated that Sony might have been pressured to tone down the film by the Japanese government, which is in delicate negotiations with the North to discover the fate of more than a dozen Japanese abducted by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s. However, many say the Sony chief executive intervened because he was alarmed by the very public -- and possibly private -- threats being hurled by the Kim regime. ''Such threats against a specific company by a sovereign state were so shocking and unusual that it is natural for the top to want to get involved,'' said Tomoichiro Kubota, an analyst at Matsui Securities in Tokyo who specializes in Sony. In the end, the Sony edits might not have had the desired effect. Although they did not specifically mention ''The Interview,'' the hackers demand that Sony not release what they call ''the movie of terrorism.'' "
Detractors of Google Take Fight to States,"They have lobbied state attorneys general. They have hired former state attorneys general. They have even helped draft a menacing letter for one state attorney general. And they have given the target -- Google -- a code name: Goliath. Google's detractors complain about the search giant to everyone they can, from raising concerns about the company's dominance with regulators in Brussels to antitrust officials in Washington. Now, they are taking the fight into states, often to push Google to censor illegal content and sites from search results. The inner workings of those efforts are outlined in emails obtained by The New York Times through open records requests. Other details are contained in messages stolen from Sony Pictures Entertainment by hackers and obtained by The Times through an industry executive. Some of the emails from Sony have been reported by The Verge, a website. Together, the emails show the extent of the efforts with state attorneys general. The messages detail how the Motion Picture Association of America -- the Hollywood industry group -- and an organization backed by Microsoft, Expedia and Oracle, among others, have aggressively lobbied attorneys general to build cases against Google in recent years, sometimes in complementary ways.  The movie association and its member companies, the messages show, have assigned a team of lawyers to prepare draft subpoenas and legal briefs for the attorneys general. And the groups have delivered campaign contributions -- with several movie studios sending checks -- to Jon Bruning, the Republican attorney general of Nebraska, who was helping push their cause, and who made an unsuccessful bid for governor this year. State attorneys general have broad authority to investigate companies involved in practices that cause consumers harm. A year ago, Google paid a $17 million fine -- a tiny amount for the giant company -- spread among more than 30 states after an investigation related to an accusation that it had violated the privacy of certain Internet users. Mr. Bruning and Jim Hood, Mississippi's attorney general, who has become one of the most active officials against Google, say they are simply trying to enforce the laws in their states. They say Google, one of the most powerful companies of the Internet era, is dragging its feet on complying with their requests to filter illegal Internet pharmacies and other illicit content from its search results. ''These guys have profited from illegal activity that they promoted in their search engines for years,'' Mr. Bruning said on Tuesday. ''There is a culture at Google of sell anything to anyone. By no means do they wear the white hat in this debate.'' But as far as Google is concerned, the attorneys general, the film group and Microsoft have a similar interest: to interfere in Google's business. Movie studios have long complained that Google does not do enough to get rid of links to pirated film and television shows online. Illegal copies of their content on YouTube, a Google property, are another complaint. By pushing the attorneys general to block illegal sales of pharmaceuticals on Google, the movie industry has concluded, they could use the same powers to curb the distribution of pirated goods. For Microsoft, any limits imposed on Google might help it improve the fortunes of its struggling search engine, Bing. ''As a trade association, our primary objective is to protect our members and their creative works -- employing voluntary initiatives, policy solutions and legal actions,'' said Kate Bedingfield, an M.P.A.A. spokeswoman. ''When wrongdoing is taking place online, we work with and support appropriate law enforcement officials, including the attorneys general, as do many other industries.'' Google insists that it has cooperated by removing some objectionable content. In a February letter that Kent Walker, general counsel of the company, sent to attorneys general, he said that it had spent over $250 million during the last three years on policy enforcement and systems that help it remove illegal content from its search index. But Google has said it does not believe it is appropriate for it to completely remove from its search results many of the sites to which the prosecutors object. ''It is our firm belief that Google should not be the arbiter of what is and is not legal on the web -- that is for courts and government to decide,'' he said in the email, which was obtained from open records requests. Google's foes have found a particularly receptive official in Mr. Hood, a folksy Democrat who grew up in northern Mississippi. In late October, Mr. Hood issued a 79-page subpoena to Google, asking for records related to its advertisements and search results for controlled substances, fake IDs and stolen credit card numbers. For months before that, a steady flow of letters from Mr. Hood to Google indicated his distaste for the company. One letter came with digital fingerprints suggesting that it had originated at a law firm, Jenner & Block, that represents the M.P.A.A. ''In my 10 years as attorney general, I have dealt with a lot of large corporate wrongdoers,'' one of his letters from November 2013 read. ''I must say that yours is the first I have encountered to have no corporate conscience for the safety of its customers, the viability of its fellow corporates or the negative economic impact on the nation which has allowed your company to flourish.'' The movie industry, through a nonprofit group it funded called Digital Citizens Alliance, picked the perfect lobbyist to squeeze Mr. Hood: Mike Moore. Mr. Moore was Mr. Hood's predecessor as Mississippi attorney general and helped start Mr. Hood's political career. He remains a close friend of the attorney general and travels with him frequently; he has even played a role in helping Mr. Hood get elected as the president of the National Association of Attorneys General, emails obtained by The Times show. Mr. Moore, in an interview, said he was working pro bono to advise Mr. Hood on how to combat the illegal sale of drugs online. He was then hired, for a fee he would not disclose, by the Digital Citizens Alliance in a similar post. Mr. Moore then became a critical source for the movie industry, according to one email, telling them how Mr. Hood's inquiry was progressing and even alerting industry executives that Google had been sent a subpoena -- before it said it had been told. Peggy Lautenschlager, who served as attorney general in Wisconsin, said that the role that the movie industry had played in pushing Mr. Hood, through Mr. Moore and others, was inappropriate. ''A private interest is influencing some attorneys general's offices,'' she said. ''Tragically, that is how the world operates nowadays.'' Mr. Hood and Mr. Moore said their actions were motivated by wrongdoing by Google, not by any pressure from the movie industry or Microsoft. The Digital Citizens Alliance said it had been public about pushing Google to clean up its search results. Microsoft, which among other efforts has supported FairSearch, a group pushing attorneys general, declined to comment. ''I don't think there is any secret that there is a group of interested industry people who have a problem and they are concerned about how Google is doing their business,'' Mr. Moore said in an interview. ''But frankly, Attorney General Hood, and seven or eight others, are concerned about drugs, about child pornography and illegal steroids.'' The groups have also done more than write letters to attorneys general. Executives from the M.P.A.A., for example, urged the group's members to donate $1,000 each to Mr. Bruning's campaign for governor in Nebraska. The plea coincided with a fund-raising event for Mr. Bruning in March at Microsoft's offices in Washington. Campaign finance records show that donations came in from Paramount Pictures, Sony, 21st Century Fox, as well as other movie industry players, each for exactly $1,000. Mr. Bruning said that he did not solicit the donations, and that they did not influence him. Mr. Hood's office did not respond to specific questions about his use of a letter apparently prepared by a movie industry executive as a draft for a warning he sent to Google, or about the role Mr. Moore had played in lobbying his office. But Mr. Hood said in a statement that his office accepted help from outside companies as it investigated wrongdoing. ''If they have expertise to help us catch the bad guys, we gladly accept their help,'' his office said. ''Google has put their profits ahead of the safety of children and families and this office will continue to fight them with all the expertise at our disposal in an effort to protect the people of Mississippi.''

The End of Movies,"Yesterday at Grantland, in a kind of harmonic convergence with Sony's unprecedented cancellation of a major Christmas-season movie in response to pressure and threats from the North Korean-affiliated hackers who had already exposed various studio secrets, Mark Harris has an essay on the theme of Hollywood's ongoing transformation from an industry invested in original storytelling and ad hoc experimentation, in which franchises and sequels exist to help ""finance the rest of a studio's lineup,"" to a business in which ""replication"" and ""reliability"" are everything, and ""a studio's lineup is brands and franchises, and that's it."" Harris has made versions of this argument before, as have others - it's not exactly news that Hollywood is increasingly enslaved to the ""pre-sold"" property - but in this case he's put together two grimly detailed documents, two release schedules showing the five-year plans that the major studios have built for themselves out of superhero movies (above all) and then also ""Star Wars"" sequels and ""Harry Potter"" arcana and reboots of everything from ""Jurassic Park"" to ""Max Max"" to ""The Terminator"" to ""Beverly Hills Cop."" And to stare at these extraordinary lists of movies pre-planned entertainment properties, at ""Aquaman"" and ""The Bourne Identity Five"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean Whatever,"" is to find oneself contemplating a kind of tentpole totalitarianism, a moviegoing future from which even the imagination will have no means of escape.   The cancelled release of the ""The Interview"" is connected to an entirely non-metaphorical totalitarianism, of course, and it's significant on a much higher level than the business of cinematic art. Right now this looks like one of the most successful (and most unlikely) terrorist coups in recent history, whose success could have all sorts of unpleasant implications for other entities - not just public institutions, but corporations and citizens - that might find themselves in a rogue-state-affiliated hacker's crosshairs next. But if you care about the movies, then what's happened to Seth Rogen and James Franco's comedy is also related to the depressing story that Harris has to tell. Not because a coarse comedy about two idiot celebrities assassinating the North Korean dictator represents some kind of brilliant alternative to the sameness of sequels, but because its fate will become (already has become, in fact) a cautionary tale in an industry that's already so risk-averse, so fearful of political controversy, so determined to make movies that sell equally well in every overseas market, that the North Koreans themselves were one the last available real-world villains for its blockbusters. So for studios already inclined to recycle comic book villains and reboot Reagan-era properties and resurrect Captain Jack Sparrow from here to eternity, the fate of Sony - whose post-hack problems go well beyond the lost revenue from ""The Interview"" - will offer just one more reason to stick with the tentpoles, one more reason to play it safe with superheroes, one more reason to pause before greenlighting an original story and say, ""okay, but maybe if the villains were neo-Nazis instead?"" (And that's just until the neo-Nazis find a hacker of their own ...) The title of this post is hyperbole, of course. Lots of good movies are still being made in this era, lots will still be made post-""Interview"", and television has expanded the frontiers of cinema in ways that help make up for what's being lost on bigger screens. Perhaps the best film from a major director I've seen this fall is Jane Campion's ""Top of the Lake,"" which of course is a TV miniseries that first aired on the Sundance Channel last year. I'm sure eventually I'll see a great film that has its premiere on YouTube, and that Frank Bruni and I will find a way to argue about its politics. But if you love the movies, and stare long enough at Harris's lists, should you be discouraged? I think you should. And will what just happened make things worse? Almost certainly it will. See you at ""Aquaman 3."" "
The Year of the Hack,"­SCENE: LOS ANGELES -- DAY ­ Two Hollywood executives walk along Sunset Boulevard sipping coffee. The Hollywood sign hangs in the distance, overlooking all of Tinseltown. The executives are discussing the Sony hacking scandal. ­EXECUTIVE 1 ''Those emails aren't really that bad. I mean, come on, I've sent much worse to people at other studios. Remember that thread on Tom Cruise?'' Both executives laugh as they drink their coffee.  ­EXECUTIVE 2 ''I totally agree. And let's be realistic. If you went through anyone's email in America, you'd find a deluge of nasty stuff about co-workers. Imagine what the inbox of a Wall Street analyst looks like.'' ­EXECUTIVE 1 ''Well, I'll tell you one thing, I'm not sending emails like that anymore. The next time I want to rag on Angelina Jolie, I'm picking up the phone.'' In recent weeks, a cloud has hung over Hollywood as the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment has exposed one embarrassing tidbit after the next. While hackers have released Sony employees' personal information, including some salaries, medical records, Social Security numbers and even unreleased movies, it has been the slew of private emails between executives that has generated the most titillating headlines. Which, while sad, is understandable. Mix celebrities, money and salacious gossip and you've got a potion very few people can stop themselves from taking a little sip from. (Some of the emails from Amy Pascal, co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures, for example, detail conversations where Angelina Jolie was called a ''minimally talented spoiled brat,'' and racially tinged emails about President Obama's imagined movie tastes.) Movie executives I spoke with, all of whom declined to be named for fear that speaking out would entice hackers to target their inboxes, said the Sony emails were relatively tame by Hollywood standards. ''I've seen much, much worse,'' a well-known screenwriter said. ''Heck, I've sent much, much worse.'' One person reminded me of the vulgarity-spewing character Ari Gold from HBO's ''Entourage,'' who is based on real Hollywood characters. And as my colleagues Michael Cieply and Brooks Barnes noted in an article Monday, ''virtually nothing in Sony's stolen emails looks different from what would likely surface if the hackers hit another studio.'' But rather than change their trash-talking ways, the executives say the real lesson of the Sony hack is to assume that no email is safe from prying eyes. And so in recent days, when they had something vulgar or highly sensitive to share, they have found themselves going back to the old-fashioned phone call. Some are even walking down the hallway to deliver profanities in person. According to a producer in Hollywood, people have been staying clear of email and opting for cellphones over the past two weeks as studios have been bolstering firewalls and email systems. ''Everyone has been doing business on their cellphone since this happened,'' the person said, asking not to be named. ''The reality is, every studio has emails in their system that would cause the chaos if they came out."" Or as Jenni Konner, a writer and executive producer for HBO's ''Girls,'' said on Twitter Tuesday night: ''The worst thing about the Sony hacks is people using the phone again.'' It's not only people in Hollywood who are picking up the phone again in case of an email hack. For the rest of us, the Sony hacking is just another example of how our emails are highly insecure. ''Don't put anything in an email that you wouldn't want to see on the front page of The New York Times the next day,'' said Brian Krebs, who specializes in cybercrime and operates the website Krebs on Security. ''It's like putting a postcard in the mail.'' ''And you can't unsay anything you've said on the Internet,'' Mr. Krebs added. Anyone who thinks they are immune hasn't been following the news this year. If I had to give 2014 a tech moniker, it would be The Year of the Hack, with numerous companies including Home Depot, JPMorgan Chase and now Sony the victim of cyberattacks in which millions of customers' information were stolen. So what are we supposed to do: never utter a negative word about anyone ever again? That's about as unrealistic as high school students not standing by their locker gossiping (or doing so via text message). ''The most devastating part of this entire story is even if Sony Pictures employees did everything right themselves, using the best passwords and the best encryption, they are still at the mercy of their I.T. managers,'' said Kevin Roose, an editor at Fusion who has spent weeks going through all the email in the Sony hack. ''Every computer is a Pandora's box of sensitive and incriminating data, and most of that data isn't even ours.'' Mr. Roose suggested we could learn from teenagers, who are flocking to privacy-minded services like Snapchat, where text and images can disappear after being read. ''While it's not perfect, it's a lot better than email or text messages,'' he said. Perhaps it seems appropriate to give the last word here to Ms. Pascal, who has been in the eye of the Sony hacking storm: ­SCENE: LOS ANGELES -- DAY­ Amy Pascal being interviewed by a Deadline reporter about her leaked emails.­ ­DEADLINE ''Is there something you hope people reading these emails will factor into their thought process?'' ­MS. PASCAL ''What you'd like to say is, don't read them. Can we all make a pact not to read these, whether they're mine or somebody else's? Because I'm not the last person this is going to happen to.'' Fade to black. "
European Regulator Issues New Guidelines for Online Payments,"LONDON - A European banking regulator said on Friday that online payment processors must put in place tighter security protocols by next summer to help cut down on fraudulent payments in Europe.  The regulator, the European Banking Authority, issued a series of minimum security requirements for payment service providers in the European Union. The guidelines, which must be put in place by August 2015, include requirements that payment processors use stronger authentication for consumers who buy goods and services online. They also suggest that e-merchants bolster efforts to protect sensitive customer data, such as not storing payment information. ""The E.B.A. guidelines on Internet payments provide the legal basis for achieving a level playing field"" for all payment service providers across the European Union,"" Geoffroy Goffinet of the regulator's consumer protection unit said in a news release. The new guidelines come after several American merchants, including the Target Corporation and Home Depot, experienced embarrassing security breaches in recent years in which hackers were able to improperly access customer data, including credit card numbers. The European Central Bank said in a report in February that online fraud was rising in Europe. The report found that fraudulent online card payments were responsible for 794 million euros, or about $977.7 million, in losses in 2012, the most recent data available. The fraudulent payments were up 21.2 percent from the previous year. The new guidelines are expected to bridge a gap until the European Union adopts revised rules, known as a payment services directive, for payments across the region. Those revisions are expected by 2018. The European Banking Authority, which was established in 2011, crafted the new rules in conjunction with the European Forum on the Security of Retail Payments, an initiative between central banks and supervisors of payment processors in Europe. It will fall on local supervisory authorities, such as the Bank of England or the Bank of France, to ensure that the new guidelines are met. "
North Korea Warns U.S. Not to Take Sony Action,"TOKYO --  Warning of ''serious consequences'' if the United States retaliates against it over the damaging cyberattack on Sony Pictures, North Korea insisted on Saturday that it was not behind it, and it offered to prove its innocence by taking part in a joint investigation with Washington to identify the hackers. The message, attributed to an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman and carried by North Korea's state-run news service, appeared to be the secretive government's response to President Obama's statement the day before that the United States would take action in response to the hacking, which has shaken one of Hollywood's largest studios.     American officials said the hackers' methods and other clues had led them to conclude that North Korea was behind the attack, which resulted in the posting online of confidential Sony emails and some unreleased movies.   The cyberattack and emailed threats of attacks against movie theaters prompted Sony to cancel the Christmas release of ''The Interview,'' a comedy about a plan to assassinate the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. North Korea has previously denied responsibility for the hacking, though it called the attacks a ''righteous deed'' by its ''supporters and sympathizers.''   It is unlikely that the Obama administration will take the offer of a joint investigation with the North seriously.    While some computer experts still express doubts that the North was actually behind the attack, American officials said it was similar to what was believed to be a North Korean cyberattack last year on South Korean banks and broadcasters. One key similarity was the fact that the hackers erased data from the computers, something many cyberthieves do not do.   Some American officials have said that North Korea appears to have embraced cyberterrorism as its new weapon of choice for making political points, and that it may be trying to extort new concessions from the United States and its allies.    On Saturday, North Korea described the American claims that it was behind the attacks as slander, and warned the United States not to reject its offer of a joint investigation, the statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency said, according to The Associated Press.   It quoted the unidentified spokesman as saying that any joint inquiry would prove that the North was not behind the cyberattack.   ''The U.S. should bear in mind that it will face serious consequences in case it rejects our proposal for joint investigation and presses for what it called countermeasures,'' the spokesman said, The A.P. reported.   ''We have a way to prove that we have nothing to do with the case without resorting to torture, as what the C.I.A. does,'' the statement said.   Mark Stroh, a National Security Council spokesman, reiterated on Saturday the administration's confidence in evidence the F.B.I. said shows that North Korea was behind the attack on Sony.    ''We stand by this conclusion,'' Mr. Stroh said. ''The government of North Korea has a long history of denying responsibility for destructive and provocative actions.''   Mr. Stroh said, ''If the North Korean government wants to help, they can admit their culpability and compensate Sony for the damages this attack caused.''   The hackers did considerable commercial damage to Sony Pictures; some of the emails that were posted were embarrassing to the studio. The hackers also released detailed breakdowns of executive salaries.   Sony said the threats against theaters had left it no choice but to cancel the Dec. 25 release of ''The Interview,'' in which Seth Rogen and James Franco play the producer and host of a television talk show who get an exclusive interview with Mr. Kim, and then find themselves recruited by the C.I.A. to kill him.   On Friday, Mr. Obama faulted Sony's decision to withhold the movie, saying that it had created a precedent of studios giving in to intimidation.    "
Obama to See if North Korea Should Return to Terror List,"HONOLULU -- As the United States moves closer to taking Cuba off the list of state sponsors of terrorism, President Obama said he would ''review'' whether to return North Korea to the list, part of a broader government response to a damaging cyberattack on Sony's Hollywood studio.  ''We have got very clear criteria as to what it means for a state to sponsor terrorism, and we don't make those judgments just based on the news of the day,'' Mr. Obama told CNN in an interview broadcast Sunday. ''We look systematically at what's been done.'' North Korea was removed from the list six years ago, but it has again prompted the ire of the United States after the F.B.I. said extensive evidence linked the North Korean government to a cyberattack on Sony Pictures. The hacking of the studio's computers, in response to a screwball comedy called ''The Interview,'' about a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, started as the stuff of Hollywood gossip but quickly escalated into an assault on an important industry -- and the right to freedom of expression. In a news conference on Friday, Mr. Obama said the United States ''will respond proportionately,'' but declined to give details. Sunday was the second day of Mr. Obama's two-week vacation in Hawaii. ''The president is always briefed on appropriate national security matters. Hawaii is no different,'' said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. He added, ''We're not going to release any details on our internal briefing process.'' Mr. Obama expressed sympathy for Sony, but told Candy Crowley of CNN that he did not consider the cyberattack to be an act of war. The studio decided to cancel its December premiere of ''The Interview'' after hackers threatened attacks on theaters if they showed the comedy. ''I think it was an act of cybervandalism that was very costly, very expensive,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We take it very seriously.'' The North Korean government has insisted that it was not involved in the attack, and in a message on the state-run news service Pyongyang warned of ''serious consequences'' if the United States retaliated. Republicans pushed back at Mr. Obama's characterization of the attack as only cybervandalism. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, told CNN that the president ''does not understand that this is a new -- this is a manifestation of a new form of warfare,'' and he proposed reimposing sanctions that were lifted during the Bush administration. The tension with the North Korean government has escalated as Mr. Obama has moved toward normalizing relations with Cuba. ''For 50 years we've tried to see if we can overthrow the regime through isolation,'' Mr. Obama told CNN. ''It hasn't worked.'' He declined to say whether Cuba would be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, but when Ms. Crowley pointed out that it would be difficult for Washington to have a relationship with Havana were it still on the list, Mr. Obama replied: ''I think so.''

How the Sony Hacking Became a Horror Movie,"Email: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter: @carr2n Kim Jong-un, who appears to be America's newly self-appointed minister of culture, has decided that it is not enough that ''The Interview,'' the Seth Rogen film about North Korea that includes Mr. Kim's assassination, will not be released. On Thursday, a message from the Guardians of Peace, the hacker group that breached the computer systems of Sony Pictures and warned against releasing the film, said ''we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.'' My, that slope became mighty slippery pretty quickly. The hackers promised that if Sony scrubbed all traces of the comedy from the Internet -- an impossible task -- they would cease a campaign that has lasted almost a month and has threatened employees and their families, embarrassed executives and potentially unleashed 100 terabytes of private company data into the world.  Federal officials said Friday morning that they had extensive evidence that the North Korean government organized the attack. A few hours later, President Obama added his voice to the chorus of critics, including irate Hollywood actors, who say Sony and the nation's theater operators should not have canceled the release. ''We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States,'' he said. It was a remarkable and disorienting turn of events: a tiny, failing state that lacks the wherewithal to feed its own people was deciding which movies we can and cannot see, while the industry it had attacked watched silently from the sidelines, and the president of the United States felt compelled to step into an international confrontation catalyzed by a lowbrow comedy. After weeks of embarrassing disclosures from Sony's hacked files, the endgame for the movie began on Tuesday, when the hackers invoked the devastation of September 11, and said that anyone who attended the opening on Christmas Day would be risking their lives. ''We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time,'' they wrote in a rambling email to news organizations. Theater chains quickly let it be known that ''The Interview'' would not be screened. Sony, saying it had no choice, withdrew the movie. Certainly, there were concerns about public safety, but make no mistake, other considerations factored in the decision, all involving dollar signs: the box office receipts of films that would be playing alongside ''The Interview'' during one of the biggest movie weeks of the year, and the holiday shoppers at the retail chains that surround so many theaters. Major cable players made it clear that they were unwilling to step in with a video-on-demand alternative, so short of hanging a bedsheet and screening the movie at its Culver City headquarters, Sony was cornered. Once the film was successfully censored, you could count the days until other films were affected. Actually, it happened earlier in the same day, before ''The Interview'' was shelved, when New Regency announced that it would drop an untitled thriller about North Korea that was to have starred Steve Carell. The threats and subsequent cancellation will become a nightmare with a very long tail. Now that cultural discourse has become the subject of online blackmail, it is hard to imagine where it will end. Documentaries, which have become increasingly important sources of news and information, could suddenly be in jeopardy. And if you've been watching the current season of ''Homeland'' on Showtime, you know that Pakistan's more sinister operations have been on wide view. This summer, HBO is planning to broadcast a comedy series starring Jack Black as a foreign service officer who takes on a rogue general who seizes control of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. Rogue states and their operatives could go after a Bond movie because they didn't like its taste in villains. (The script for the next installment was released as part of the intrusion, by the way.) And it doesn't end with the entertainment. Some news outlets, including The New York Times, have found themselves under sustained digital attack after publishing articles that displeased various groups that had the resources to respond with intrusions. Many state-sponsored actors will no doubt be emboldened by the spectacular success of the Sony breach. Things have gone so deeply wrong so quickly -- the movie industry will look back at this crossing of the Rubicon with a deep sense of shame -- it is hard to keep track of all the mistakes that led us here, but I'd like to take a crack at it. Sony I happened to be with Howard Stringer, then chief executive of Sony, during a vast security attack on its PlayStation platform in 2011 -- he looked as if he had been living inside a beehive for three days. That Sony did not harden as a target in a meaningful way afterward is inexplicable. And while I am all for bold creative choices, was it really important that the head being blown up in a comedy about bungling assassins be that of an actual sitting ruler of a sovereign state? If you want to satirize a lawless leader, there are plenty of ways to skin that cat, as Charlie Chaplin demonstrated with ''The Great Dictator,'' which skewered Hitler in everything but name. Hollywood If you are looking for courage on the lots of Hollywood, probably best to pack a lunch. Other studios were content to watch Sony dangle, saying nothing for fear that they, too, would end up on the Guardians of Peace's naughty list. The Motion Picture Association of America, which represents the film industry, went into witness protection when the crisis erupted, with a spokeswoman telling Deadline, a trade website, on Dec. 11, ''We have no comment at this time. We are not involved.'' The association condemned the attack only once the devastation was writ. The breach of Sony would seem to be exactly the kind of moment when an association has real value, when it can collectively respond to a fundamental threat to the industry. The organization and the studios it represents hid instead. As my colleagues Brooks Barnes and Michael Cieply wrote, ''The incident is likely to be remembered as a failure of Hollywood leadership.'' On Friday, George Clooney was even less polite about the widespread cowardice, telling Deadline Hollywood that when he circulated a petition of solidarity, he heard nothing but crickets in response. ''As we watched one group be completely vilified, nobody stood up,'' he said. When the novel ''The Satanic Verses'' was under attack, the book industry formed a united front. Exactly the opposite happened here. The News Media After the hackers absconded with personal and corporate information from Sony, they put the data on a site called Pastebin. Trade publications and some mainstream news outlets took the bait and spent a great deal of time rummaging through the stolen goods, and highlighting juicy emails meant to cause maximum embarrassment. What public purpose was served by printing private correspondence? We discovered that studio executives are capable of being callous, and that producers can be churlish when they don't get what they want. As Aaron Sorkin pointed out, that's not exactly new or important information. The data dump did reveal an industrywide effort to join forces against Google, but most of what was disclosed was intended to elicit clicks and smirks and the hackers knew enough to harness the base, competitive impulses of the press. News organizations mostly refrained from publishing material like passports and medical records, but in general, the news media served as last-mile delivery agents on information that was used to threaten Sony, the industry, and finally, the American public. The larger story about an unprecedented political attack on free speech took a back seat to titillating peeks at industry backbiting. The list goes on, including politicians who engaged in bombastic, warlike rhetoric, but let's just say the last few weeks in the American political and cultural narrative have been miserable. The merits of ''The Interview'' can be debated, but fundamental business imperatives and civic freedoms are clearly in play. So what is the right response? Americans are good at sitting on a couch and watching all kinds of stuff, so why not harness that impulse? David Boies, a lawyer for Sony, told ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday that the film would eventually be distributed. ''How it's going to be distributed, I don't think anybody knows quite yet, but it's going to be distributed.'' The president -- yes, it's that important -- should convene all the players who make billions from the free and unfettered display of content and broker a deal that gives Americans the opportunity to watch the film. Put ''The Interview'' on Hulu, on iTunes, on Google Play, on Netflix, on NBC and all the broadcast networks, on Showtime and all the cable stations, put it anywhere and everywhere that people can push a button and watch at the same time. Ubiquity and the lack of a discernible target would trump censorship. The industry, old and new, digital and analog, should step across a line together, holding hands with consumers and letting the world know that we prize our goofy movies, along with the important ones, and the freedoms that they represent. If disparate competitors managed to set aside self-interest and acted for the common good, it could be the social viewing event of the century. I'd do anything to do my bit for artistic freedom, including watching a buddy-movie comedy that stars Mr. Rogen and James Franco. Play the movie. "
"Threats to Police Stream In After Fatal Shootings, Putting Department on Edge","In the days since two New York City police officers were fatally shot in their car by a man who forecast his intentions online, threats of other attacks on the police have streamed in from 311, 911 and online postings. Investigators have scrambled to separate serious warnings from disturbing pranks.  On Wednesday, heavily armed officers stood guard outside a pair of precinct station houses in Brooklyn that were the targets of specific violent threats. Officials felt enough concern that the Fire Department moved an entire engine company from its base adjacent to one of the station houses. John J. Miller, the deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said: ''Some of these are angry people who call and rant; some are ill-advised Internet pranks or drunks who are texting, and those wash out fairly quickly. There are a handful that are of concern, and those are the cases where we devote the time and resources.'' Four people have been arrested in connection with making threats against officers. The Police Department has investigated more than 40 that it deemed serious among hundreds it received or saw in online postings. Many originated outside New York and have been referred to local law enforcement agencies. The sudden influx of violent messages set a department already reeling from the deaths of its officers on edge. Precincts specifically cited in the threats saw deployments of additional forces, and union officials urged officers to wear their bullet-resistant vests. The threats, officials believe, are echoes of those posted by a gunman, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who killed the two officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, on Saturday afternoon as they sat in their patrol car in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Hours before, he announced his plan on Instagram. Buffeted by the deaths of the officers at a time of widespread protests against the police, Mayor Bill de Blasio has implored New Yorkers who have seen or heard similar ''cowardly threats of violence'' to report them immediately. ''New York City stands with our police officers in this time of tragedy,'' he said in a statement on Wednesday. ''Our city will not be intimidated by those spouting hateful, violent messages.'' Of the four people arrested, two were teenagers in Brooklyn. Each teenager was charged with a felony for making a ''terroristic'' threat in messages posted on Facebook. One, Devon Coley, 18, was arrested Monday and released on his own recognizance pending a court date; the other, Yasin Shearin, 16, is being held on $50,000 bail. Two more arrests, on misdemeanor charges, stemmed from false accusations of threats: Roberto Labita, 46, of Staten Island and, in a separate incident, Robert Bowman, 52, of Washington Heights. The police said Mr. Bowman had accused his cousin of making threats when he had not. A more serious and specific warning of an impending gun battle with officers came from a police informer, placing officers at the station houses for the 79th and 81st Precincts on alert. The buildings are not far from where Officers Liu and Ramos were killed in Brooklyn. The Fire Department temporarily moved its Engine Company 222 -- located next to the 81st Precinct -- to a nearby firehouse. ''There is no threat against the Fire Department,'' Frank Dwyer, a department spokesman, said. ''This is being done out of an abundance of caution.'' "
"The Tech Changes, but Not the Crime","LOS ANGELES --  When the director Michael Mann began work on his new film, ''Blackhat,'' an international thriller about good and wicked hackers, he wanted to start by researching some technological basics. Really, really elemental stuff. Like: ''What's electricity?'' ''How does it flow?'' he wondered. ''It's not linear.''    Also, ''how does a single transistor work?'' he asked. ''How do these chips work?''    Investigating these and other ''dopey fundamentals,'' as he put it, was his way into a turbocharged story that stars Chris Hemsworth, Viola Davis and Wang Leehom, and aims to bring authentic depictions of cyberterrorism to the multiplex.    ''The way my mind works, I have to understand the basic building blocks, then I can generate up,'' Mr. Mann said in an interview in his quiet production office here. Given the resources, learning the rudiments of technology ''is simple,'' he added. ''Everything else is terribly complex.''   For Mr. Mann, the writer, director and producer best known for muscular films like ''Heat,'' ''The Insider'' ''Ali'' and ''The Last of the Mohicans,'' ''Blackhat,'' which is due Jan. 16, posed challenges unlike anything he'd ever tackled, including how to depict the tedium of coding in dramatic fashion. But at 71, with four Oscar nominations and much critical adulation to his credit, Mr. Mann remains undimmed. Surrounded by Muhammad Ali memorabilia in his office, his footnotable conversation hurtled from Eero Saarinen to Brancusi to the mechanics of a municipal storm drain; at one point, he diagramed how computer bits work.   With ''Blackhat,'' he even attended Comic Con for the first time. And as a filmmaker well-versed in black markets, corruption, the criminal underbelly and the law (Mr. Mann's credits include ''Miami Vice'' and numerous prison dramas), the film's unexpected resonance in the aftermath of the recent cyberattack on Sony served only to highlight his belief that the premise was ripe for exploration.    ''It's almost like there's an invisible kind of exoskeleton above the layer in which we think our lives take place on planet Earth, that's made up of interconnectedness and data,'' he said. ''We're swimming around in it, and everything is totally porous, vulnerable and accessible. And if it hasn't been targeted, that's only because somebody hasn't bothered to yet.''    The idea for the film -- which, he recalled in his implacably precise manner, he first had on Aug. 8, 2011 -- was inspired by Stuxnet, the computer worm that was identified in 2010, after it had struck an Iranian nuclear facility. ''Blackhat,'' the term for a vicious hacker (''white hat'' is a good guy), starts with a malware attack on a Chinese nuclear reactor. Mr. Wang plays the M.I.T.-trained Chinese military official tasked with finding the culprit; Mr. Hemsworth plays his old programming-whiz college roommate, now incarcerated, whose prison sentence is commuted in exchange for helping solve the puzzle. This being a Michael Mann movie, that means using fists as well as keyboards. Car chases, too.   Mr. Mann said he had long wanted to make a movie in Asia, bolstered by a recent visit to Indonesia for another project. ''Blackhat'' is set in Hong Kong, Jakarta and Malaysia. ''There's an explosive energy,'' he said of Jakarta, reeling off stats about its population and architecture. He likened Kuala Lumpur to ''Islamic Brentwood,'' the wealthy Los Angeles enclave. And he was eager to shoot in Hong Kong, partly because of the neon. ''I wanted it to be an atmosphere of just intense visual, chromatic, busyness and liveliness,'' he said. (He prized his cinematographer, Stuart Dryburgh, a new partner, because of his soft use of light as a counterweight.)   The movie starts with a nearly five-minute dramatization of code speeding through a network, shooting lights and grids, and a reverse internal shot of a keystroke. Mr. Mann wanted to make it as true as possible; he got a 3-D computer model from Qualcomm, the semiconductor maker, to help visualize it. ''So the geography is real,'' he said. But ''if a conductive metal has a surfeit of electrons or no electrons, it does not change color -- that's fiction. I had to present it some way; I didn't want to do motorcycles on a 3-D grid like 'Tron.' ''    Capturing the flow of data has bedeviled every filmmaker who's ever made a movie about programming, said Steve F. Anderson, a film professor at the University of Southern California who studies depictions of technology on screen. ''3-D fly-throughs, psychedelic explosions of 1's and 0's, an array of monitors and techno music'' are all part of what Mr. Anderson calls ''Hollywood technological-anxiety films.''   ''They're almost universally dystopian, and whenever there's some great new technology that's going to solve all our problems, it will invariably go awry and create drama and chaos,'' Mr. Anderson explained. Hollywood, he added, ''has a love-hate relationship with technology, because it also wants to fetishize it.''   Enter what he calls the superhacker, ''someone who can seamlessly traverse the digital world and real world.'' (This is in contrast to the other stereotype, ''the pudgy, sexually repressed, sedentary, overweight geek.'') Though ''The Matrix'' set the superhacker standard, a prime example Mr. Anderson noted was Hugh Jackman in the 2001 movie ''Swordfish.'' In an online archive of hacker clips that Mr. Anderson maintains, there's Mr. Jackman, sexy in a loose shirt, pounding red wine as he types awkwardly, shouting ''Oh yeah!'' at his seven oversize monitors.   In ''Blackhat,'' Mr. Hemsworth, the muscle-bound Australian star of ''Thor,'' is superhacker incarnate. In real life, he told a Comic Con audience in July, he had to have one of Mr. Mann's tech experts teach him how to type with more than two fingers.    To the grumble that few hackers look like Mr. Hemsworth, Mr. Mann invoked another consultant, Stephen Watt, a 7-foot blond weight lifter turned cybercriminal. ''They look like everything,'' Mr. Mann said. He choose stars who are unfamiliar to American audiences, like Mr. Wang, an American-born pop star in China, and the Chinese actress Tang Wei, who plays his sister, a systems engineer who becomes Mr. Hemsworth's love interest.   The story was so closely guarded that when Mr. Wang auditioned, he used a ''Miami Vice'' script, he said. But once he understood the part, its appeal was its atypical ''portrayal of the Asian male.'' His character speaks Mandarin and perfect English. ''That is the exact opposite of every other script I've read for an Asian role,'' he said.   Mr. Mann has his stars read together -- ''a sneaky way to be rewriting dialogue,'' he said. His process, honed early in his career as a TV writer in the 1970s and '80s, begins with a longhand outline. Once the story takes shape, ''I just dictate up the screenplay,'' he said, as though channeling different characters and conceiving their lines extemporaneously was no big deal. ''I discovered a long time ago, I cannot get it down fast enough,'' he added. (For a while, he employed court stenographers.)   Mr. Wang, 38, who called for an interview from Taiwan at 3:30 a.m. local time while finishing an album, was impressed with Mr. Mann's vitality. In their 66-day shoot on 74 locations, ''there was not one day that he slept more than four hours,'' Mr. Wang said. ''He had to have two assistants on rotation to keep up with him.''   From the start, Mr. Mann has been confident of his instincts. A Chicago native -- his favorite time of the year there is January, he said, ''because it's crystal; you see forever'' -- he moved to London to study film after discovering Stanley Kubrick as an undergraduate. Returning to the United States, he soon developed a crisp visual style. In the interview, he wore a gray shirt that set off his gray-blue eyes in his gray-carpeted office, and spoke in ecstatic detail about the volume of contrasting colors and patterns in Indonesia. (His wife, Summer Mann, is a painter.)   Mr. Mann's other hallmark is a fascination with criminals. Asked if he had ever been arrested, he declined to answer, eventually allowing only that he had never been incarcerated ''like the people in my movies.'' (Let the record show: Michael Mann has never killed a guy.) But he recounted his first time inside a maximum-security prison, where he was working as an uncredited writer on Dustin Hoffman's 1978 movie ''Straight Time,'' with awe.    ''Folsom was a revelation,'' Mr. Mann said. ''I thought there'd be draconian guards, gray men.'' Instead, ''the convicts had a kind of brio and an aggression,'' a vibrancy, and they were tuned in to life outside. ''The territorial compression of the human spirit,'' he said, makes for an intense and unlimited palette.   The emotions translated to the canvas of cybercrime and code breaking. ''I understand,'' he said, ''because I was a young male, that challenge of, 'You telling me I can't get in here?' You wanna bet?' ''    Though Mr. Mann was eager to make an of-the-moment movie, hacker films typically don't age well, Mr. Anderson said. (See: that clip of Mr. Jackman.) He suggested that perhaps Hollywood's narrow, dweebs-or-supermen portrayal may even damage technological literacy. ''It doesn't leave much room for ordinary people who just want to learn to write code,'' he said.   For Mr. Mann, who is known to re-edit his movies for DVD and has had final cut for his entire career -- ''I think it's a moral right,'' he said -- concerns like that may come second to auteurism. Asked if he made the film as an entree into the lucrative Asian market, he said no. ''I don't think of the audience; I just think of what's interesting to me,'' he said. His creative blueprint, he added, is ''absolutely intuitive and visceral.''   ''The way in is usually through the amygdala,'' he said, ''not the cerebral cortex.''     "
The Pirate Bay Has a Plan to Avoid Blockades,"The Pirate Bay's website, which is used to download copyrighted movies, music and television shows, is often taken offline by authorities. Last year, the site changed its domain name six times, shuffling among .se, .sx, and .ac domains, after court orders to block the site.  Now the organization says it has a plan that could keep The Pirate Bay online indefinitely. According to Torrent Freak, a website that monitors BitTorrent and online copyright, The Pirate Bay will try to sidestep authorities by building a peer-to-peer network (rather than a centralized network) that will allow anyone to download and share files simultaneously using a Pirate Bay-specific program. ""The goal is to create a browser-like client to circumvent censorship, including domain blocking, domain confiscation, IP-blocking,"" someone who works with The Pirate Bay told Torrent Freak. ""It's basically a browser-like app that uses webkit to render pages, BitTorrent to download the content while storing everything locally."" In other words, it's moving some of the heavy lifting to the user's computing device. The new browser-like app will enable the site's data to be shared among the other users who are getting access to Pirate Bay content. This way, the service does not require a public-facing URL or website for people to get access to torrent files. Another important aspect of the new service is that it would eliminate the need for standard Web domain addresses. In August Pirate Bay programmers released a free web browser, PirateBrowser, that allows people in countries where the site is blocked to still reach its hundreds of thousands of illegal torrent files. According to the site, the PirateBrowser has since been downloaded 2.5 million times. The Pirate Bay is blocked in Iran, North Korea, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Denmark, Italy and Ireland. But people who use the web browser can get around those restrictions.  "
U.A.E. Releases American Who Was Jailed for Satirical Video,"An American man who was jailed in the United Arab Emirates for his part in a satirical video is being released this week after serving his sentence, a representative of the man's family said. Shezanne Cassim, 29, was jailed by a State Security Court on Dec. 23 under an article of the federal cybercrimes law, which provides for jail and fines for anyone who uses information technology to publish caricatures that are ""liable to endanger state security and its higher interests or infringe on public order.""  At the time of the sentencing, Mr. Cassim, who is from Woodbury, Minn., had already been in detention since April.  On Tuesday, a representative for his family, Jennifer P. Gore, said in a statement that customary practice in the United Arab Emirates equates nine months imprisonment to a one-year sentence, so Mr. Cassim was already being processed for deportation based on time served and was expected home this week.  ""I can't tell you how relieved our family is by this turn of events,"" Mr. Cassim's brother, Shervon Cassim, said in a statement.  ""We are very excited, and we are grateful to everyone who worked to free Shez."" The local KSTP channel said in a report that he could be arriving at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on Thursday morning. The video comedy sketch, created by Mr. Cassim and four other men who were also detained, was about the fictitious Satwa Combat School, set in the Dubai neighborhood of the same name, with an instructor named Saloom Snake, who trained combatants to throw sandals, use the thin ropes of an Arab headdress as weapons and summon help on Twitter for fights that never actually occur. The video was posted on YouTube in 2012. In the opening scene of their satirical 20-minute video, the amateur filmmakers posted a disclaimer saying: ""The following events are fictional and no offense was intended to the people of Satwa and U.A.E.""  But it did little good convincing the authorities. Two Indian men were also given a one-year sentence and, like Mr. Cassim, a fine of 10,000 dirhams, about $2,700. The court had also given two Emirati citizens eight-month sentences each and fines of 5,000 dirhams, while three other foreigners were sentenced to a year each in their absence, The National, a local newspaper, reported. Mr. Cassim's case was widely shared on social media and Twitter, using the hashtag #FreeShez, to highlight freedom-of-speech and artistic expression restrictions in the Gulf Arab emirates. A website was created to provide updates on his case, and the American comic actor Will Ferrell and others created a . The Twitter account @JusticeforShez highlighted Mr. Cassim's case in the broader context of how the emirates were trying to attract high-profile cultural and music events.

American jailed for youtube #FreeShez - Justice for Shez (@JusticeforShez)28 Dec 13 After the release was announced, Rori Donaghy, the director of the Emirates Center for Human Rights, which monitors human rights in the U.A.E., also drew attention to the cybercrimes law. The nightmare is ending for Shezanne Cassim but more will suffer unless #UAE authorities change their repressive cybercrimes law. #freeshez - Rori Donaghy (@roridonaghy86)7 Jan 14 Mr. Donaghy said in a statement: It is of great relief for the Cassim family that Shezanne can return home, but until authorities change the cybercrimes law it is simply a matter of time before another story of injustice emerges from the U.A.E. Shezanne Cassim and his friends should never have been put in prison, and hopefully they can recover from this nightmare, but for the peaceful Emirati activists who use the Internet to challenge human rights abuse there is no escaping authorities who have criminalized even the mildest forms of criticism."" The forthcoming release of these young filmmakers is welcome but it does not solve the issue. Authorities continue to use the cybercrimes law to restrict free speech, as demonstrated by the recent sentencing of a 19-year-old Emirati activist to three years in prison for using Twitter to speak out about human rights violations in his country.

Behind the Cover Story: Emily Bazelon on Anonymous's Brand of Vigilante Justice,"Emily Bazelon, a contributing writer for the magazine, wrote this week's cover story about efforts by Anonymous, the online collective, to push law enforcement to reopen rape cases that they believe have been mishandled. Bazelon, who is the Truman Capote Fellow for Creative Writing and Law at Yale Law School, is the author of ""Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy.""   How did you get going on this article?I'm really interested in how to police social media for kids. I say the word ""police"" kind of gingerly. But what do we do about all the cruelty and harshness out there online? It is something that social-media companies themselves struggle with, and I generally think that they don't do enough about it. The police and law enforcement and schools also find this to be a really difficult issue. It is such an overwhelming amount of content, and it is not really clear what their role is. When I realized that there was all of this vigilante activism going on, I became interested in how it was playing out online, and what effect it is having on the lives of kids.   Why is there so much opportunity for vigilantism? Is online harassment so new that the police have not yet figured out how to enforce the law - or is the law lagging behind?I do think that there are big gaps in the law that these groups are trying to fill. Whether they are doing that successfully or not is another question. They are addressing a vacuum. I would favor stronger laws or stronger enforcement of laws that go after people for cyberstalking or for posting revenge porn, which I have also written about. Those laws might have helped some of the girls I wrote about in the article. I also think there is a big gray area here. Cruelty on social media can add up to being really traumatic, but it can be hard to know whether it is criminal or not. It's clear that circulating sexually explicit photos of a teenager could violate the law. But when you are talking about people just writing a lot of nasty stuff online, it is less clear. New laws could address some of these things, but some of them are social problems that have to do with changing norms.  The Anonymous operatives are famously secretive. How did you approach them and why did they agree to be interviewed?It was through Twitter. Because I've written before about this issue, there were some people who were willing to trust me. These were relationships that took months to develop. A lot of activists have a hunger to be recognized and to feel like they are reaching as many people as they can reach. So even though in Anonymous the biggest sin you can commit is to be a glory-seeker, if you feel that talking to a reporter might help you reach more children in order to help them, you might be able to talk yourself into it. And you might not feel as if the community will rip you to shreds for doing it. I'm not sure what the reaction to the article will be, and maybe some of the people who talked to me will get raked over the coals for it if they are seen as courting publicity. Still, they want to further their activism. They all, to a person, resisted glory for themselves. What is their opinion of routine law enforcement?They feel that whatever mistakes their fellow activists make, law enforcement makes worse mistakes. There is a lot of mutual antagonism there. In the case of Rehtaeh Parsons, a Canadian teenager who hanged herself after photos of her being raped were circulated in her town, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police initially said they didn't have enough evidence to bring charges. Then, following Anonymous's efforts to draw attention to the case, the R.C.M.P. announced that they would reopen that investigation, and later two boys were charged for distributing child pornography. Anonymous felt they had stuck it to law enforcement.  I came away from your article really down on Internet vigilantism. How do you feel about it?I think each operation, or op, needs to be judged individually. Ones that have really responsible people working on them are probably on balance a good thing. I think that is true of Maryville and probably also of the one about Rehtaeh Parsons, although that one is more fraught, because there was an innocent person accused. Others really go off the rails, which of course is the difficulty with vigilantism - it has no ties to any sort of institution. I think you can have a healthy skepticism about it for all the obvious reasons: It isn't under anyone's control, and it can go awry. I'm glad that you read my article and came away with a strong reaction, even if it is different from the one I had.  To what extent does Anonymous contribute to the problem of people being falsely accused of crimes?It depends whom you believe, but there are aspects of the Steubenville case that have the same troubling element. We tend to be absorbed by the cases in the headlines, but when other people get falsely accused, we might be less likely to see it.  What determines if Anonymous gets involved in something?It's pretty random. It depends on the collective judgment of the group. The people who are the wisest in the world I was writing about are trying to look for where they can have the biggest impact. Where is a really serious injustice? They are not looking for just some teenagers or adults individually behaving badly, but a real institutional lapse. What really interests Anonymous is when they feel the authorities have just completely blown it, and they can step in and play the role of hero. Or at least the role of, Let's reopen this case and make sure we thoroughly investigate before we decide not to prosecute.  "
"On Children's Website, N.S.A. Puts a Furry, Smiley Face on Its Mission","WASHINGTON -- The turtle wearing a hat backward, baggy jeans and purple sunglasses looks just like other cartoon characters that marketers use to make products like cereal and toys appealing to children. But the reptile, known as T. Top, who says creating and breaking codes is really ''kewl,'' is pushing something far weightier: the benefits of the National Security Agency. ''In the world of diplomacy, knowing what your enemy is planning helps you to prepare,'' the turtle says. ''But it is also important that your enemies do not know what you have planned. It is the mission of the National Security Agency and the Central Security Service to learn what it can about its potential enemies to protect America's government communications.''  Such an enthusiastic endorsement of the N.S.A.'s mission might seem particularly timely given the criticism directed at the agency since one of its former contractors, Edward J. Snowden, began leaking documents he had stolen from it. But T. Top and a troupe of eight other smiley-faced cartoon characters have been busy promoting the N.S.A.'s mission for the past nine years as part of a governmentwide attempt to make agencies more understandable to the public. With cartoon characters, interactive games and puzzles, the N.S.A.'s CryptoKids website for ''future codemakers and codebreakers'' tries to educate children about spying duties and recruit them to work for the agency. As the website says: ''It is never too early to start thinking about what you want to do when you grow up.'' To enter the ''How Can I Work for N.S.A.?'' section of the site, children click on a picture of a bucktoothed rabbit, who says in his biography that he likes listening to hip-hop and rock. In his free time, the bunny says, he participates in cryptography competitions with other cartoon characters named Decipher Dog and CryptoCat. ''As a signals analyst, you will work with cutting edge technology to recover, understand and derive intelligence from a variety of foreign signals found around the world,'' children are told in the future employment section. ''You will also attempt to identify the purpose, content, and user of these signals to provide critical intelligence to our nation's leaders.'' Civil libertarians, not surprisingly, said the website was propaganda. Experts on early childhood education and marketing to children said the tactics used by the N.S.A. were similar to the way McDonald's puts toys in its Happy Meals. ''This is the N.S.A. putting on its best face and the way it wants to present itself without anyone else providing their opinions or making noise -- and for children, it may make them feel good about what the N.S.A. does,'' said Nina Huntemann, a professor at Suffolk University who studies the social impact of new media. ''Is that necessarily bad? I'm not that pessimistic; it happens all the time,'' Ms. Huntemann said, referring to efforts by the government, companies and educators to promote messages to children through cartoons and games. ''But these sites have been shown over and over to be ineffective at actually connecting with people.'' Vanee Vines, a spokeswoman for the N.S.A., said that ''like many government agencies,'' the N.S.A. ''has a special website for children.'' ''The site,'' she said, ''is designed to help children learn about cryptology and N.S.A.'s mission to defend the nation.'' The site complies with a policy memo from President Bill Clinton that called on all federal agencies to develop ways to educate children about government. The F.B.I. and the Central Intelligence Agency are among the other government agencies that have their own sites to try to educate children about their missions. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to oversee intelligence agencies, hosts a website that links ''kids, parents and teachers to U.S. government information and services on the web from government agencies'' that are ''geared to the learning level and interest of kids.'' Other government agencies and departments that have websites for children include the Department of Energy, the State Department, the Department of Treasury, the National Counterterrorism Center and the National Reconnaissance Office. Electronic games have also been popular. In 2002, for example, the Pentagon released the video game America's Army to encourage people to enlist. The N.S.A. started CryptoKids with seven characters, according to a news release in 2005, ''to make researching America's cryptologic heritage and learning about N.S.A./C,S,S, fun.'' In 2010, the N.S.A. added two more characters, the CyberTwins Cy and Cyndi, to educate children about ''staying safe while enjoying cyberspace.'' ''Both are world travelers,'' the N.S.A. said in a news release about the new characters, ''taking turns accompanying their Dad (a computer scientist in the U.S. Army) on his business trips around the world.'' The CyberTwins are now the first cartoon characters that visitors to the website see. Although the Internet is a ''great'' place, Cy advises children, ''there are people out there who don't have your best interests in mind -- stop and think before sharing private information, especially on social networking websites.'' After reading Cy's message, children can enter the website and begin to ''Meet the Gang'' and play the games that allow them to make secret codes. "
Navigating the Logistics of Death Ahead of Time,"Abby Schneiderman, then a 32-year-old mother and entrepreneur, was getting ready to celebrate her daughter's first birthday when she received the news: Her older brother had been killed in a head-on collision while driving through East Hampton, N.Y., with his family. Suddenly, her fledgling business -- Everplans, a website that helps people create detailed end-of-life plans -- took on greater meaning. ''In the middle of building this site to help all of these hypothetical people that might die someday, my family experienced a tragedy,'' she said. ''My brother was 51 and had all of the resources to have a plan in place. But my family was still left with a huge amount of logistics and complicated decisions that we had to make.'' Just as she was building the tool to help people navigate through the mental fog that follows such a devastating loss, she and her family were experiencing it. ''It turned what had been a project into a mission,'' said Ms. Schneiderman, now 33. ''And we wanted to make sure that nobody was left in the same situation my family was in, which was without a plan.''  The site, which she founded with Adam Seifer, 45, recently introduced the so-called Everplan, which approaches life's last big event in the same way you might plan a wedding or another major occasion: It walks users through what an end-of-life and estate plan should include, provides a place to store everything and goes as far as offering reviews on funeral homes and nearby restaurants. It will also handle the invitation. The number of end-of-life planning and document storage sites is on the rise, like AfterSteps.com and Principled Heart, and many of those, too, have sprung from personal loss or out of necessity. Other websites deal with a specific piece of planning, such as online memorials, sending emails from the grave (morbid, I know) or what should happen to your Facebook account. And some estate planning lawyers are said to be working on storage sites of their own. The next obvious question: How secure are these sites, particularly when storing so much personal information -- even passwords -- in one place? Most of these services advertise bank-level security and include other talk about encryption, which doesn't mean much to most people. In fact, Bruce Schneier, a well-known computer security expert, said a lot of hacking had nothing to do with encryption. You ultimately have to trust the company, he said, because somebody, somewhere, probably has access to the decryption keys. Mr. Schneier said he would like to see some type of legal fiduciary responsibility. If the company makes a mistake, he asked, who is at fault? That's a good question to keep in mind if you're considering using these services. Here's a closer look at how some of them work: Everplans The site, which is easy to use, is surely one of the most comprehensive. When you set up an account, you start by taking a short assessment to see how much planning you've already done, and why you're there. Recently have a child? Caring for an aging parent? Based on that information, the service creates a to-do checklist, and tells you how to prioritize. It might suggest filling out vital personal information first, then creating a will and naming a health care power of attorney. (The site links to the relevant medical forms in each state.) Once you're done -- and you probably won't finish in one sitting unless you're already hyper-organized -- the account serves as a repository for just about everything: financial accounts and legal documents; where to find your Social Security card and life insurance policy; how to close the cable television account, to name but a few. There's also room to share life lessons or an explanation of why your will was written a certain way. If you already have a contract with a funeral home or crematorium, you can upload that, too. How and when do your loved ones get access? You assign specific ''deputies'' for your plan, so they can find everything neatly in one place. Much of the site is free, but if you want to upload documents and have more than one deputy, the service costs $35 annually. As you fill out your checklist, you'll also notice a couple of ''preferred providers,'' including Integrity Life Solutions, an insurance and annuity firm, and Rapidocs, which helps you create legal documents, including wills, online. (Doing this online has its own pitfalls, but that's another story.) Right now, the co-creators said they weren't getting paid for referring you to these companies, but it's possible they might in the future. The co-founders promise that, even if the company is sold in the future, they are working on a system that would allow people to gain access to their plans for at least the next 50 years. Principled Heart This site, six months old, is the brainchild of William Bissett, a certified financial planner at Pinnacle Advisory Group, a money management firm. He created the site to answer a common question that his clients asked: So, where do we keep all of this stuff? And how will my children know what to do? Mr. Bissett said he took a minimalist's approach, encouraging people to keep only what was necessary, including passwords or instructions on where to find passwords for financial accounts, social media and other accounts. A section is dedicated to instructions for pets, a ''last letter of instruction,'' people to contact, as well as a place to upload up to 60 documents (and soon, up to 40 photos). You can also give a financial adviser read-only access to certain accounts. Three people are required to validate the account owner's death, and then the site, which costs $45 a year for up to one gigabyte of storage, will provide access to all the information stored inside to the named beneficiaries. AfterSteps This service, created by Jessica Bloomgarden while she was at Harvard Business School, begins by asking you to name three verifiers. These are the people who will be notified in the event of your death and will get access to all the information stored on the site (either now or a time you specify later). After you enter basic personal details, it asks who should be contacted by the verifiers after you die. The site's layout is simple and clean, and it offers some guidance along the way. After entering the basics, you enter the legal section, where you can upload your will and let others know where to find it. If you don't have a will or a financial power of attorney, and you live in certain places, AfterSteps will let you upload free basic forms issued by your state. (Some of them were confusing, notably Wisconsin's will. If you want to generate a will online, there may be better options.) But if your state isn't listed, the site suggests trying Hyatt Legal Plans, a unit of MetLife Company, which is free if you subscribe to AOL. (AfterSteps sells its service to organizations like AOL, which provide it to its members or employees.) AfterSteps doesn't currently make money from the referral to Hyatt, but it could in the future. Like the other sites, it provides a spot for other legal forms. You can also store passwords and instructions for digital accounts, upload photos and share wishes for your funeral arrangements, among other things. The site requires a credit card at sign-up -- it costs $60 a year or $299 for life -- but there is a free 14-day trial period. Other Options These sites -- and there are several more -- make it easier to ensure you have the basics in place. But nothing is stopping you from using free options like Dropbox, though you'll have to let your survivors know how to get inside. There are also storage-focused options like SecureSafe. Then there's the old-school alternative: a manila folder stuffed with all you need to know, as long as it's stored in a safe yet accessible place. Last year, I mentioned the ''What if...'' workbook, a helpful guide -- an actual book -- where you can write all of this stuff down. Whatever method you use, what's most important is that you put a plan in place and let your inner circle know where to find it. "
"Jerry Roberts, Last of Team of British Code Breakers, Dies at 93","Jerry Roberts, the last surviving member of the British code-breaking team that cracked strategic ciphers between Hitler and his top generals, helping to hasten the end of World War II, died on March 25 in Hampshire, England. He was 93. His death was confirmed by the Bletchley Park Trust, a nonprofit group that administers the Victorian estate north of London where the British government lodged Mr. Roberts and hundreds of other code breakers during the war, among them linguists, mathematicians and puzzle masters of various backgrounds.  Mr. Roberts, a German linguist, was part of a small top-secret group assembled in 1941 to help decrypt messages picked up in radio signals between Hitler and his field marshals on the front. The team's very existence remained a secret until 2006, when the British government declassified wartime intelligence files. By 1941, Bletchley Park cryptographers had already deciphered thousands of messages transmitted by lower-level German commanders in the field, thanks to the work of the mathematician Alan Turing, who in 1940 cracked the daunting German secret code that the British called Enigma. But they were stumped by the even more complex ciphered messages being transmitted among Hitler and the generals Erwin Rommel, Wilhelm Keitel, Gerd von Rundstedt and Alfred Jodl. Code breakers initially called the system Fish, taking the name from a German code operator who, in an unguarded moment, had referred to the code as ''sägefisch'' (sawfish). Mr. Roberts and his group nicknamed it Tunny -- as in tuna fish -- and they were able to crack it. Mr. Roberts eventually served as the head cryptologist for the team, which grew to more than 100. The messages the team deciphered enabled the British government to warn Soviet leaders in 1943 about a major German offensive planned at Kursk that summer. The Soviet Army's repulse of the attack in the Battle of Kursk was a turning point of the war. The Tunny code breakers later helped set the stage for D-Day, establishing in the weeks before June 1944 that Hitler and his commanders expected an Allied invasion along the French coast at Calais, preceded by a feint at Normandy. The Germans were caught off guard by the full assault at Normandy. Like the Enigma code, the Tunny code was produced by an encrypting machine that used a formula to transform words, one letter at a time, into corresponding cipher-symbols. They were then scrambled repeatedly by electrical rotors that could change the pattern, or ''key,'' of each cipher an almost infinite number of times. (The Enigma code had been produced by a machine with four rotors; the more complicated Tunny code employed a machine with 12, Mr. Roberts said.) As long as the German wireless operator at each end of the message used the same machine, and each machine made the same pattern of almost infinite changes, the message was decipherable. Figuring out the logic in the Germans' nearly flawless ciphering system was ''a miracle,'' Mr. Roberts was quoted as saying. Its only flaw, he said, was in requiring human operation. ''We owe the breaking of the code to the errors of German operators,'' he said in a 2006 speech. German operators erred egregiously several times, he said, by sending encrypted messages twice in exactly the same way, violating a requirement that they reset the machine's ciphering code for each message. This gave the British analysts a rich field of material to study, he said. The Germans' other mistake was to exchange chitchat in Tunny. British cryptographers gleaned a lot, for example, when a German operator at the Russian front said ''Cold!'' in Tunny, and when an operator in Italy attested to the ''murderous heat.'' The context of such transmissions helped them understand the coded language. (Another commonly overheard German message was, ''I'm so lonely.'') ''It's very difficult to explain how to break messages,'' Mr. Roberts told an interviewer. ''Even when you had good knowledge of the German language and the skill, you still needed a kind of knack.'' The trick, he said, was to ''follow that instinct.'' Raymond Clarke Roberts (known as Jerry from childhood) was born on Nov. 18, 1920, in Wembley, in northwest London. His father was a pharmacist, his mother the organist in a church. He studied German and French at University College in London. His ambition was to join the Foreign Office. After the war broke out, Mr. Roberts said, his German professor, Leonard Willoughby, who had been a leader of the Admiralty's code-breaking unit in World War I, asked if he might be interested instead in ''work of a secret kind.'' Mr. Roberts, a civilian, joined the British intelligence agency and was given the rank of captain for the duration of the war. Mr. Roberts is survived by his third wife, Mei Li, and two daughters and a son. After leaving government service, Mr. Roberts founded a research and marketing company, which he sold in 1993. In an interview with The Telegraph, he conveyed the excitement code breakers experienced when deciphering strategic information, and the frustration they felt at having to keep their work secret. When sharing the information with allies, British intelligence always attributed it to ''spies.'' ''I can remember myself breaking messages about Kursk,'' Mr. Roberts recalled. ''We were able to warn the Russians that the attack was going to be launched, and the fact that it was going to be a pincer movement. We had to wrap it all up and say it was from spies, that we had wonderful teams of spies.'' "
"At Bletchley Park, a Reminder About the History of Cracking Codes","Hackers are regularly in the news these days for cracking secret codes, so it's sometimes easy to forget that breaking codes has a long history. The newly restored Bletchley Park heritage site in Britain offers a nice reminder.  Bletchley Park, once Britain's highly classified government center for code breaking during World War II, now invites curious guests who want to poke around and learn its secrets. A recent $13.5 million restoration project has resurrected the once-crumbling collection of buildings and returned the complex to its wartime state - except now it has plenty of informative exhibits that explain the code-breaking process and how math and science helped beat the Nazis. An easy day trip from London, Bletchley Park has even received an official visit from Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, whose grandmother worked there during the war. The areas open to visitors include the mansion that once contained the main offices, as well as many of the huts where thousands of mathematicians, cryptographers and code breakers (many of them women) worked around the clock to crack encrypted messages from Nazi Enigma machines, which helped encrypt and read messages, and other Axis sources.  Alan Turing, a Cambridge mathematician who is perhaps the best known of the Bletchley boffins, is celebrated in an exhibit that details his life and work, and includes a rebuilt version of the electro-mechanical bombe he helped develop to crack the Nazi codes. Bletchley Park, about a hour train ride from London, says it has the largest publicly displayed collection of Enigma machines in the world, and other exhibits detail the work against German and Japanese codes. Walking tours of the site are available from staff members, but the museum also offers inventive multimedia guides - iPod Touch players loaded up with short documentary videos and interviews from wartime military and civilian veterans of Bletchley Park.  In addition, the National Museum of Computing is in a separate but adjacent building to Bletchley. Among other historic hardware, the museum hosts a rebuilt version of Colossus, the world's first electronic computer that was built in 1943. An annual season ticket for Bletchley Park admission is £15, or about $25; the National Museum of Computing charges £5 for the whole place or if time is short, or £2 to gawp at Colossus.  But even if you can't make it in person, the Google Cultural Institute has an interactive site devoted to all things Bletchley Park. The site offers a virtual tour of the facility, with plenty of archival photos and video interviews with former staff members.                        "
Did Big Internet Companies Handicap Start-Ups in FISA Rule Changes?,"SAN FRANCISCO - A small but significant caveat in a new agreementbrokered between the Obama administration and Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft could cast a long shadow over America's technology start-ups. Intelligence officials agreed only to allow communication providers to disclose more specific information about data sought by government agents because of a new provision that bars companies less than two years old from disclosing such information for a period of two years. That caveat effectively means that no one will know whether the government is eavesdropping on a new email platform or chat service for two years.  Ladar Levison, the founder of Lavabit, the email service used by Edward Snowden that was the target of a government investigation last year, said the new rules would cast a pall over new technology companies while doing little for the established companies. ""While our courts are allowed to keep ethically dubious court orders secret, it will remain impossible to trust private data to American companies,"" Mr. Levison said. ""As an American businessman, this reality is terribly upsetting."" Until now, technology companies were forbidden from acknowledging government requests they received under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Now, under the terms of the new agreement, the government will allow companies that are older than two years old to disclose the number of FISA orders they receive in increments of 1,000. They can publish that number in increments of 250, if they lump the number of FISA requests with the number of so-called National Security Letters they receive. Companies will also be allowed to release the number of ""selectors"" - user names, email addresses or Internet addresses, for instance - that the government sought information about and will be allowed to  publish the information every six months, with a six-month delay. Because of those amended rules, Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft agreed to dismiss their lawsuits before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. But Mr. Levison said the number of FISA requests was less important than the kind of information sought by each request. If a FISA order asks a company to turn over its source code or encryption keys, for example, one order could affect thousands of users. ""They're asking companies to do some pretty scary things, well beyond what they would ask for in a normal criminal order and doing it because there is no civilian oversight,"" Mr. Levison said. ""What we really need is information about the means and methods the government is using to conduct these investigations."" Other privacy advocates note that though it seems like bigger technology companies are throwing their younger counterparts to the wolves, the belief that there is no legal precedent for Monday's agreement means start-ups are still free to mount their own legal challenges to disclosure restrictions. ""We were disappointed that the technology companies abandoned their fight in FISC which we believed they were going to win,"" said Nate Cardozo, a staff lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, referring to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. ""The start-ups are still free to raise their own challenges, which, frankly, they would win."" ""The First Amendment goes a lot further than today's settlement,"" Mr. Cardozo added.  "
A Chinese Spy Novelist's World of Dark Secrets,"Mai Jia, a top-selling Chinese espionage novelist and former soldier, has been writing about secrets for years. In his half-dozen novels, Mr. Mai, who has sold millions of books and won many Chinese literary awards, including the Mao Dun Literature Prize, describes intrigue at home that most Chinese, let alone non-Chinese, know nothing about. But his work has taken on a new sense of urgency as the world adjusts to the scale of surveillance by American intelligence agencies that has been revealed by Edward J. Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency in the United States.  Mr. Mai says his message, available for the first time in English next month when his novel ''Decoded'' comes out in the United States and Britain, is about more than China; it's about the world. ''I feel this world is filled with secrets. People are very secretive. People are animals that are very protective of themselves,'' he said over lunch  in an upscale development in the hills west of Hangzhou, where he lives. ''Those of us who went through the Cultural Revolution have experienced how truth and falsehood can't be distinguished. The truth is not 'out there,''' he said, a glimmer in his eyes. There is a secretive quality to Mr. Mai too. ''I'm mildly socially phobic,'' he said. The author, 50, spent 17 years in the People's Liberation Army, some of that time among top-secret cryptographers in an undisclosed location, he said. Bullied as a child for being from a politically ''bad'' family, paradise for him is a secluded library, as it was for Jorge Luis Borges of Argentina, his literary hero. In ''Decoded,'' the main character, Rong Jinzhen, is an autistic math genius from an illustrious family, his talent and burden symbolized by a too-large head. He is hired by the military's top secret Unit 701 to break two highly advanced codes - Code Purple and Code Black, both  created by China's No. 1, though unnamed, enemy. Rong experiences existential loneliness, loss and finally madness. Rong and Mr. Snowden are two sides of the same coin, Mr. Mai said. ''Both Snowden and Rong Jinzhen were abandoned by God,'' he said. ''The tragedy is that there are quite a few people like that in every country. Honestly, what Snowden revealed wasn't America's ugliness but today's world. It has been hijacked by technology and whether we're talking about Country Y or Country X I'm afraid I truly believe that as long as we use these technologies what we'll get is this shady business.'' Mr. Mai was born Jiang Benhu in 1964  (he changed his name as an adult) in Fuyang outside Hangzhou. He is lionized at home for his novels, some serialized for television or filmed. After ''Decoded,'' released in Chinese in 2002,  came ''In the Dark,'' ''The Message,''  the ''Whispers on the Wind'' trilogy and  ''Knifepoint.'' Translations into other languages are underway, said his agent, Gray Tan, who is based in Taiwan. Zhang Yiwu, a Peking University professor of Chinese literature, said in an interview with the Beijing newspaper Jinghua Times: ''Usually I find the trouble with detective and spy fiction is that the spirit is too mathematical, there's no human character or feelings. With Mai Jia's works there's a mathematical spirit, but also human character and feelings.'' What Westerners may be discovering about espionage - its ubiquity - Chinese have always lived with, David Der-Wei Wang, the Edward C. Henderson Professor of Chinese Literature at Harvard University, said in a telephone interview. ''Spying, encryption, intrigue and secrecy,'' he said, ''have been part of human political and military engagement since ancient times.'' That is especially evident in one-party states, like China, where the authorities have uncontested insight into people's lives. ''Mai Jia and his characters would argue that the 'art' and politics of spying and encryption are already ingrained in every level of our life,'' Mr. Wang said. He added: ''Heroes and heroines are accidental individual, even existential, figures, groping for a meaning that is always one step beyond full understanding.'' It's a bleak vision. Mr. Mai said he was a ''pessimist'' about human nature. His style is a mixture of ''revolutionary historical romance, spy fiction perhaps inspired by Western sources, and the psychological thriller,'' Mr. Wang said. For Mr. Mai, entering the army at 17 was an escape from a difficult childhood. His family represented three dangerous ''affronts'' in the politics of the early People's Republic of China: ''landlord, religious and right.'' One grandfather was a well-off farmer, one a Christian; his father was a ''rightist'' - in reality, Mr. Mai said, his father was picked to fill the commune's quota of political enemies because he talked a lot and ''exaggerated things.'' As a soldier he read whenever he could and shot guns as little as possible. He spent one of three years in Tibet in the early 1990s reading a single book: Borges's short stories, ''The Book of Sand.'' Other literary loves are Franz Kafka and Stefan Zweig. ''I loved Zweig because he wrote about fantastical people. And I wasn't an ordinary person either.'' Eventually, he left the army to write full time. A lonely child, he kept a diary to have something to confide in. It has grown to 36 volumes. ''I really grew up outside of society,'' he said. ''A formless wall surrounded me. I was very sealed off. But by being sealed off I was very strong. I lived in my imagination.'' As if to illustrate that, the Chinese edition of ''Whispers on the Wind'' has a photograph of Mr. Mai on his daily jog in Hangzhou's Botanical Gardens, on a path he stamped out with his own feet. ''Clamor is our enemy,'' is written underneath. ''Literature is a higher calling than politics,'' he said in the interview. Later, in an email, he elaborated: ''Literature gave me breadth and calm. God is by me. And I dare to talk with the devil.'' "
"Oops, Sorry for Being So Creepy","HENRY ALFORD is the author of ''Would It Kill You to Stop Doing That? A Modern Guide to Manners.'' Circa Now appears monthly. Have you ever been unintentionally ''cybercreepy''? I have. A few weeks ago, after stashing my bathing suit and towel in my locker at my gym, I reached for my cellphone to check my email. ''You can't have a cellphone in here!'' an older gym-goer rebuked me. Thinking he feared I was about to conduct a lengthy phone call about how I like enough mustard on a sandwich such that the salami comes alive but not so much that it becomes a mustard sandwich, I explained to the man that I was only checking my email. ''No, it's not that,'' he rightly explained to me. ''There are naked people in here.'' I apologized and skittered off. The more common iteration of unintentional tech-based creepiness, of course, is a kind of peekaboo that is thrust upon you. It starts with a colleague handing you her phone so that you can look at her vacation photos. You begin swiping through her sunshiny mementos -- palm tree, cabana, palm tree, palm tree -- when, suddenly, blammo: there's your friend in her starkers. A large hole has now been rent in the time-space continuum; even your watch stops ticking.  Or consider the ravages of autocorrect and autofill. Maggie Robbins, a psychotherapist in private practice in New York, said: ''Last fall, by accident, I texted one of the people I work with -- I dislike the terms 'patient' and 'client'-- about a lunch plan I had that day with a friend. I sent something like, 'Really looking forward to seeing you this aft!' '' Ms. Robbins added: ''I texted the person about an hour later to apologize for the gaffe. It was treated as humorous. But the potential for creep-out was very high, especially as many of my texts to friends are downright silly.'' We bumble, we misrepresent. At a point in history when invasions of electronic privacy are mostly the product of corporations and governments, and when online privacy seems ever more likely to become a luxury good that we'll have to pay for, it can be helpful to lay claim to our own culpability, too. ''To quote Pogo, 'We have met the enemy and he is us,' '' said Linda Ellerbee, the host and executive producer of ''Nick News With Linda Ellerbee.'' ''We've always been able to make great fools of ourselves. It's just the technology has gotten faster and more broad.'' Ms. Ellerbee speaks from experience: in 1972, while working for The Associated Press in Dallas, she wrote in a personal letter to a friend some remarks that were critical of her employer, and then accidentally sent the letter out over The Associated Press newswire. Ms. Ellerbee was fired. ''It was hugely embarrassing. But I just had an opportunity most people didn't have. Now everyone has the opportunity.'' The etiquette of these gaffes is usually fairly cut and dry: you goof up, and then you offer remonstrance. But the landscape becomes more complicated when the gaffes are fueled by a larger degree of intentionality. Colin Summers, an architect, said: ''A few years ago my son Rudy and I decided to try the Veggie Grill in Santa Monica. I thought it would be grilled vegetables and was sorely disappointed; it is soy product masquerading as meat. While we were sitting poking at our food, I checked in with Facebook, which had a new feature that told you who was nearby. It said there was someone in Veggie Grill with us. Paula. I didn't recognize her, but I figured she was one of my wife's friends who'd migrated over to my Facebook page. I glanced around at the mostly empty restaurant and said, 'Paula?' A woman sitting alone with her book and food looked up. 'Yes?' Very confused. I didn't know her at all. I glanced back down at my phone. Back up. 'Uh, Facebook told me you were here. Just checking.' 'Oh. O.K.' Not even an 'Enjoy your dinner' or anything!'' Yes, Mr. Summers comes off as slightly cheeky. But Paula seems downright chilly. Let's look now at a recent tweet from Emily Bell, a professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, and the director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism. It ran, ''That thing where you show a colleague a locked Twitter account of a Mexican drug lord and they 'accidentally' send a follow request from you.'' In a phone interview, Ms. Bell said she'd been reading about the arrest of the head of a drug cartel in Mexico, and had sought out his Twitter account. ''I couldn't resist going through his followers list and seeing who he's following.'' Ms. Bell showed the account to a colleague at Columbia, who playfully sent a follower request from Ms. Bell's account. Ms. Bell laughingly asked her colleague: '''What's going to happen to me? You have submitted a request to someone who is clearly engaged in violent acts. What happens when this drug lord gets this weird request from a middle-aged professor at Columbia? What's he going to think? Something awful, I imagine.' '' Ms. Bell summed up: ''It was very Larry David. The whole thing was very Larry David.'' The dividing line between playful and aggressive behavior is even murkier in the case of a woman whom Thomas Thornburg, a professor at the University of North Carolina, met online. ''I had a profile on a dating site last year,'' he said. ''As is the norm, I didn't share my real name or any directly identifying info. I included a photo of myself, along with photos of flowers and architecture that I've taken and liked. A woman contacted me through the site's mail system, telling me who I was and where I worked. She was proud of her sleuthing and wanted me to be as well. She had recognized a column on a building in one of my photos, and knew the organization in that building. She went to the employee directory of the organization on its website and, looking for someone who matched my dating photo, found me. Voilà. She told me about it. She didn't mean to be sinister. I was creeped out enough by the thoroughness of a complete stranger to take down that photo of columns. I meekly congratulated her on her detective work. We never met, however. Her sleuthing was a red flag.'' In the end, is there any wisdom or advice to be extracted from those who've spent time in the cybercreepy trenches? Ms. Bell said: ''The only way to make sure that everything is safe is don't make a digital copy of it. And get a box Brownie.'' Ms. Ellerbee added, ''My only two pieces of advice are 1) Remember that almost no message or thought was ever lost for 30 seconds' conscious thought first, and 2) Disable autocorrect now.'' But might there be someone whose ability to creep others out is more thoroughgoing, and thus might offer even more perspective? For 33 years, the actress Cassandra Peterson has deployed fake blood, skeletons, plunging necklines, white pancake, and corny wisecracks in her role as the horror movie hostess Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. Ms. Peterson suggested that those of us who are unintentionally cybercreepy might do this: ''Basically act like it's nothing out of the ordinary. When people get scared of me because I'm walking past them in a hotel lobby as Elvira, I'll say, 'Hey, where's your Halloween costume?' It puts them slightly on the defensive, but in an amusing way. Then we'll all laugh and everyone gets comfortable. It puts them at ease.'' Ms. Peterson also said it's helpful to have stock lines that are self-deprecating. ''People always ask me, 'What do your parents think of you dressing like that?' Having been a showgirl in the past, I'll say, 'They're just happy to see me wearing clothes.' '' Too, it would probably help if we cultivated more tolerance toward the gaffe-makers. Recently a friend sent me a sheepish email saying that, in a previous email about possible dates for a get-together, she'd omitted the word 'maybe.' I fired back: ''All is understood! Dingo ate your maybe.'' "
"With Better Security Technology, Hotels Shore Up Blind Spots","At a poker tournament in Barcelona last September, Jens Kyllönen, a professional player, said that his room at Hotel Arts was broken into and malware was installed on his computer to transmit anything he saw on his screen as he played. Despite video camera systems and electronic key card entry logs, no one was caught. Although he said he discovered the malware in time, he says he is much more careful now about where he stores his belongings and secures his computer. Hotel Arts declined to comment, saying it was a private event.  His case is just one in what has become a technological cat-and-mouse game between hotels and criminals. Smaller and cheaper cameras, smarter key card systems and communication among hotels add up to a more closely watched environment than in the past. Criminals are also using new technology to foil security measures and execute scams. Cameras are typically installed in public spaces like lobbies and hallways, said H. Skip Brandt, executive director of the International Lodging Safety and Security Association in Boston, and director of security at a hotel in downtown Boston. The numbers of those monitored public spaces are multiplying as video cameras and systems come down in price and increase in power. Advanced closed-circuit video systems provide ''low-light vision, facial recognition, and movement and color recognition analysis software,'' said Tom McElroy, a partner at the Hospitality Security Consulting Group in Reno, Nev. Panoramic lenses can be attached to some existing video surveillance cameras for a 360-degree view. Larger cameras used to be mounted primarily in ceilings to get the best view and so they would be less likely to be tampered with, said Tom Waithe, regional director of operations for Kimpton Hotels in the Pacific Northwest. The new equipment, smaller and unobtrusive, is being installed at eye level now, he said, so faces are more visible to police and hotel employees. Videos can protect hotels as well. ''If a guest says their laptop was stolen from the dining room at a certain time, we review the tapes,'' to see what the circumstances were, Mr. Waithe said. ''If someone says their car was dented in our parking lot, we can see if that was the case or not.'' The advancements are not contained to video. New card key systems have become increasingly sophisticated and their uses have expanded beyond opening the guest room door. In some newer systems, Mr. Brandt said, ''management can be notified if a key has been tried unsuccessfully multiple times or in multiple rooms, or if a door has been left ajar.'' Employees' key cards can record which housekeeper, security or maintenance employee has entered a guest room. Hotels like Kimpton's Hotel Monaco in Seattle require guests to insert their keys into hotel elevators. While hotel chains can be fiercely competitive, they cooperate in matters of security. In his work with the International Lodging Safety and Security Association, which includes heads of security at local and nationwide hotels along with representatives from law enforcement, Mr. Brandt manages email lists to share information about criminal or suspicious activity at the hotels, as well as police reports and educational materials. Mr. Brandt said in one instance, a scam artist pretending to be a movie location scout was rooming and eating free at a number of hotels until his picture went out to the hotel security group email list and he was apprehended. In New Orleans, Mike E. Cahn III, president of the Greater New Orleans Hotel and Lodging Association security network, says he sends surveillance tapes showing criminal activity to other area hotels, and to the police, who sometimes put them on YouTube. Recently a man stole a laptop from a conference room, Mr. Cahn said, and within 24 hours, he was recognized from the distributed video footage and apprehended. Criminals are increasing their use of technology as well, said Vijay Dandapani, president of Apple Core Hotels, a group of five boutique hotels in Midtown Manhattan. He has seen hackers create a free Wi-Fi hot spot that looks as if it is offered by the hotel, to record guests' keystrokes and gain access to their data. Hotel employees will notice the ''evil twin'' network when it pops up and try to shut it down. ''Pickpockets have followed wealthy people for hundreds of years,'' Mr. Dandapani said. ''This is the modern version of it.'' Despite the spate of new technology, the human touch remains critical to security, Mr. McElroy said. There's more than one reason employees are trained to greet guests they see throughout the hotel, he said. ''When the maid says good evening in the hallway, or the bellman says hello in the lobby, they are making someone feel like they have been noticed,'' he said. For a guest this may feel respectful and welcoming, Mr. McElroy said. But ''for a criminal, it means a staff member has seen them and might identify them later.'' Workers at some hotels are trained to identify other types of ''guests.'' The American Hotel and Lodging Association Educational Institute recently offered a video to help hotel employees identify and help victims of child trafficking and prostitution. The 30-minute online course is part of a group of videos that educate hotel workers on potential criminal activity. Mr. Waithe says that common sense prevents most petty crimes. He listed some precautions: Don't leave your laptop for a minute. Don't take your eye off your luggage while you are checking in. Don't give out credit card information to someone calling your room who says they are from the front desk. Don't leave your door ajar to go down the hall and get ice. And ''always use the chain or extra latch in your hotel room.'' He says, ''Our video cameras show opportunistic thieves just walking down hallways trying each door, looking for the one that didn't click all the way closed.'' "
Hiding History in Firefox,"Hide History In Firefox Q. Is there a way to make Firefox automatically open in the Private Window mode so it never keeps track of my browsing, history or cookies? A. The Firefox settings have an option to always start up the browser in the Private mode. In the Windows version, click the Menu icon on the right side of the toolbar and then click the Options icon. In the Options box, click the Privacy tab. (On a Mac, go to the Menu icon, click Preferences and select the Privacy tab.) In the History area of the box, click the drop-down menu next to ''Firefox will:'' and select ''Use custom settings for history.'' Turn on the checkbox for ''Always use private browsing mode'' and let Firefox restart to enable the new setting. The Firefox history list of sites you visit from then on should remain empty until you turn off private browsing.  Firefox's private browsing mode does not save passwords, search entries, cookies or temporary (cached) Internet files either. Most major browsers include a similar feature, although it goes by different names depending on the program -- Incognito mode in Google Chrome, InPrivate Browsing in Microsoft's Internet Explorer and so on. While the browser's private mode helps protect your online privacy, it is not meant to give you the full cloak of anonymity as you travel the web, nor does it protect you from malware. Even though the browser does not save the information, your Internet service provider or employer can still track the addresses of the sites you view, and those sites themselves can also log your computer's visits. Making the Move From the iPhoto App Q. I upgraded to iOS 8, but when I tried to open the iPhoto app, I got a message saying the app was unsupported and I had to move all my pictures to the Photos app. What is going on? A. With the arrival of iOS 8, Apple discontinued support for its own iPhoto for iOS app. As you have noticed, when you try to open iPhoto on an iOS 8 device, you get a message advising to ''Migrate data from iPhoto to Photos.'' If you tap the Migrate button, the pictures you edited and saved with iPhoto get pulled into the iOS 8 Photos app -- but not everything you may have done in iPhoto makes the trip. Picture captions and tags used in iPhoto are not displayed in Photos. Also, the text and layouts from any photo books, slide shows or web journals are not transferred, but the pictures used in them are converted into standard albums. Apple's site has a note at support.apple.com/kb/HT6290 that explains the transition in detail.

A Fired Banker and a Firm's Public Suit,"When Warren Woo, a deal maker at UBS, left the Swiss bank in 2007 to start his own firm, he named his family office Breakaway Capital. Years later, that choice of name has proved prescient. Since decamping from UBS, Mr. Woo - who subsequently jumped to two other firms - now finds himself defending accusations by his most recent employer, the lender Monroe Capital, that he stole confidential information to help start a competitor. It's unusual that any company, let alone a risk-averse financial firm, would want to publicize firing an employee for cause. But Monroe Capital hasn't been shy in letting the world know that it fired Mr. Woo for what its chief executive, Theodore L. Koenig, called ""serious violations of company policies.""  The firm's lawsuit against its onetime employee tells a tale of deceit in which the banker forwarded over 300 messages of confidential information to his Breakaway email address over the past year and a half. Among the data were analyses of incoming deals and financial information of Monroe Capital clients. Mr. Woo regularly deleted the messages from his sent folder after forwarding them. The lender became aware of Mr. Woo's email habits only this month when the Securities and Exchange Commission sent a subpoena requesting information about Breakaway Capital, according to the lawsuit. Within a week of receiving the S.E.C.'s request, Monroe Capital's management decided to fire the executive for cause. It then filed suit against Mr. Woo in a state court in Illinois, where Monroe Capital is based. ""Right now, our focus is to recover the information which he took and to prevent its use for anything but Monroe Capital purposes,"" said Michael Dockterman, a lawyer for the firm. Neither Mr. Woo nor his lawyer returned calls or emails seeking comment. But in court filings, the banker is seeking to relocate the case to Federal District Court in Chicago. The lawsuit is the latest strange turn in the career of Mr. Woo, a Los Angeles native who climbed the ranks of investment banking at a number of firms before he joined UBS in 2000 as a specialist in lending and advising private equity firms. After leaving the Swiss bank in 2007, he spent roughly a year at Moelis & Company, the boutique investment bank run by his former UBS supervisor, Kenneth D. Moelis. Around the same time, he joined a group to buy the Nashville Predators hockey team. And after he left UBS, Mr. Woo set up Breakaway Capital, initially to become a full-service advisory firm. But his efforts initially led nowhere. Mr. Woo resurfaced in 2011, when Monroe Capital announced that it had hired him to lead its nascent Los Angeles office and run its West Coast operations. At the time, Mr. Koenig praised his newest hire as ""one of the most successful and respected bankers on the West Coast over his 22-year career."" He was, the firm said, a rain maker who had advised on more than $25 billion worth of deals. At Monroe Capital, Mr. Woo became a prominent overseer of the firm's main lending fund. And he was allowed to make some investments for his own account - provided that he give his employer the chance to participate in relevant deals. But within two years of joining, according to the lawsuit, he began forwarding trade secrets to his Breakaway Capital email. In some messages, Mr. Woo told at least one potential client to send all future communications to the Breakaway Capital email, the suit says. This spring, Mr. Woo filed papers in Delaware and California to do business as Breakaway Capital, working with a former private equity executive. And on Breakaway's website, the new firm claims to be a private investment firm with $50 million in capital to invest. Not until receiving the S.E.C.'s subpoena on June 9 did Monroe Capital begin looking into the executive's behavior. An investigation concluded that he ""actively intends to use this information to compete with Monroe Capital by taking deal source leads generated by Monroe Capital."" During an emergency special meeting convened last Monday, Monroe Capital's other senior executives digested the inquiry's findings. They ultimately decided to fire Mr. Woo. "
Finding an App to Manage Passwords,"Apps to Manage Your Passwords Q. The recent news about hackers stealing website passwords has persuaded me to look for a smartphone app to log all my password updates so I don't have to remember them. But what happens if I lose my phone? A. Guarding against a lost phone means that you need to make sure no one can get to your password file -- and that you should have a backup of your data elsewhere.  Good apps for managing passwords require a master password to even use the program, so make sure you select a strong password from the start. If your phone is gone for good, you can still get to your password data if the app you use has a backup tool built in -- which is something to consider when shopping for software. Password-manager apps can vary in services, but many include backup options for syncing an encrypted copy of your password file to an online server or directly to a computer; some even let you log into your account from a browser. Some of the more full-featured apps include automatic website logins for stored passwords, complex-password generators and security alerts. To start shopping, just search your app store for ''password manager'' and carefully read the feature set and reviews of the programs listed. Plenty of solid password-manager apps are available. The multiplatform 1Password from AgileBits, for example, offers Dropbox online syncing, but can also sync directly to a PC or Mac if you are squeamish about putting sensitive information in the cloud. LastPass, which works on multiple platforms too, can also store your information on other devices and has a guide for those with lost or stolen phones at bit.ly/XJAe6p. Another well-reviewed app, Dashlane, has its own notes on the topic at bit.ly/1iRgl1p. As a general security rule, you should also turn on your phone's screen-lock setting to prevent anyone who picks up your handset from browsing its contents. Taking advantage of additional features within your phone's operating system -- like remote locating and data erasure if the phone is lost -- can also keep your personal information out of unauthorized hands; Android, iOS and Windows Phone include such tools. Help Overseas From Kindle Q. Does the Mayday help button on the Kindle Fire HDX work if I travel to Europe? A. Amazon says its Mayday live technical-support service works internationally on the Kindle Fire HDX for customers registered with the Amazon.com store in the United States, and those in Britain registered to the Amazon.co.uk site. As at home, you do need to have a strong Wi-Fi connection for the best experience. Amazon's site has additional information for using the Kindle Fire HDX when traveling outside the United States. Also, be sure to pack any necessary international plug adapters so you can charge the battery abroad. TIP OF THE WEEK Google's Knowledge Graph generates additional information about keywords from a search on Google, and the feature has recently begun to offer simple foreign-language translations right at the top of the page. For instance, when you type something like ''translate tractor into Dutch'' into the Google search box, the first item at the top of the results page is a response from Google Translate, with the translated word in large type and the option to hear it pronounced aloud. You do not have to leave your search results page to get the Google Translate answer and can move on to browse dictionary links and other results. The software can handle words and simple phrases in several languages and can even auto-detect many words of unknown origin -- try entering ''translate'' followed by a word in a language you are unsure of (as in ''translate nacht'') to get a result back from a language Google recognizes. Google is not the only search engine working to make simple translations quick and easy. Similar queries to Microsoft's Bing search engine will sometimes bring back a result from the company's Bing Translator, but not yet as reliably -- or audibly. J.D.

5 Charged in Identity Theft Ring That Is Linked to Bank Tellers,"Five people have been charged in an identity theft ring in which bank tellers stole personal information from customers and used it to withdraw money from their accounts, Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general, said on Tuesday.  The defendants stole more than $850,000 over several years, using customer information to create fake driver's licenses and checks to gain access to accounts, Mr. Schneiderman said. The victims were customers at several of banks in the region, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America locations in the Bronx, White Plains and Yonkers. The three tellers, Nadia Figueroa, 23, Kalika Arline, 29, and Venise Cole, 27, are accused of stealing personal and financial information from hundreds of customers. Tyrone Lee, 28, who prosecutors say was the leader of the group, and Anthony Davis, 29, are said to have manufactured the fraudulent documents. All are from the Bronx except Ms. Cole, who is from Florida. The group used the fake documents, which prosecutors said sometimes included photos of its members, to withdraw money from banks in New York City, Westchester and Orange Counties, Long Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts. ''Bank tellers have access to our most sensitive financial information and we must be able to trust that our data will remain safe and secure,'' Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. The banks reimbursed the customers whose accounts were affected, according to the attorney general's office. The five defendants were each charged with grand larceny, identity theft and scheme to defraud. They had all been arrested or were in custody on Tuesday night except for Ms. Cole, who was being sought, Mr. Schneiderman's office said. Ms. Cole worked as a bank teller at a TD Bank in Apollo Beach, Fla. Ms. Arline worked at a Bank of America in White Plains, and Ms. Figueroa worked at a JPMorgan Chase in White Plains and a Wachovia (now Wells Fargo), in Newburgh, N.Y., prosecutors said. "
"Lyft Sues Former Executive, Says He Stole Trade Secrets","The ride-hailing wars aren't going away. Lyft, a San Francisco-based hail-a-car start-up, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday evening against a former executive, arguing that he stole confidential company information in the weeks before he left the company.   ""We are disappointed to have to take this step, but this unusual situation has left us no choice but to take the necessary legal action to protect our confidential information,"" said Erin Simpson, a Lyft spokeswoman. The lawsuit accuses Travis VanderZanden, Lyft's former chief operating officer, who left the company in August, of downloading important company information including financial data, information on future product plans and growth statistics. The lawsuit says that Mr. VanderZanden's personal online storage account contained more than 98,000 files and folders after he left the company, according to a copy of the filing obtained by The New York Times. Mr. VanderZanden joined Uber, Lyft's strongest rival, just two months after leaving Lyft. ""VanderZanden's conduct not only breaches the confidentiality agreement, but also breaches fiduciary duties of loyalty and confidence he owed to Lyft as an officer and employee,"" the suit said. For years, Lyft and Uber have been locked in a bitter, continuing battle to conquer the ride-hailing industry. Both Uber and Lyft have resorted to cutthroat tactics to beat each other, including systematic attempts to poach drivers and employees as well as mimicking each other's product releases. Both companies offer similar services: Users can call a private car using a smartphone app. The lawsuit hints that Mr. VanderZanden had second thoughts about resigning. Before he left, Mr. VanderZanden sent an email telling Lyft's co-founders that everyone should ""think this through ... before we finalize,"" according to the filing. ""I love you guys like brothers,"" Mr. VanderZanden wrote, according to the suit. Uber did not respond to a request for comment. Efforts to reach Mr. VanderZanden have been unsuccessful. "
Home Depot Posts a Strong 3rd Quarter Despite a Data Breach Disclosure,"Home Depot, the country's largest home-improvement retailer, booked robust gains in sales and profit in its third quarter, as a brightening economic picture spurred more people to buy homes and renovate them. Those gains appeared to ease concerns that an expansive data breach at the retailer would scare customers away before the critical holiday sales season. Uncertainties over how much the breach could ultimately cost Home Depot, however, coupled with conservative guidance from the company for the full year, caused investors to tread cautiously after the market opened.  Home Depot said in its guidance that extra losses from the breach ''cannot be estimated at this time.'' By the end of the trading day, shares of Home Depot had fallen $2.05, or 2.1 percent, to $95.98. In September, Home Depot, which is based in Atlanta and operates almost 2,300 stores in North America, said that hackers had targeted its payment terminals, possibly compromising some 56 million customers' credit or debit card data. The breach raised concerns that customers would hold back spending at the retailer, especially on larger-ticket purchases typically made by credit or debit cards. Still, the retailer's net earnings for the third quarter came to $1.5 billion, or $1.15 per diluted share, beating analysts' expectations by 2 cents a share. The retailer reported net earnings of $1.4 billion, or 95 cents per diluted share, for the same period last year. Sales for the quarter climbed 5.4 percent from the same period last year, to $20.5 billion. Comparable store sales rose 5.2 percent over all and 5.8 percent at United States stores. ''During the quarter, we saw strong performance across all geographies, led by growth in transactions and continued strength in the core of the store,'' Craig Menear, Home Depot's chief executive and president, said in a statement. Mr. Menear later told analysts that it was difficult for Home Depot to determine whether the data breach had any impact on the quarter's sales. ''But we were very pleased we had positive transaction growth in each month in the quarter. We feel this shows customer confidence in Home Depot,'' he said in a conference call. Michael Lasser, an analyst at UBS, said in a note after the earnings announcement that he believed Home Depot's sales ''were relatively consistent month-to-month, suggesting the data breach didn't really have a profound impact on its performance.'' Home Depot sales have risen on a broad recovery in the American economy and a rebound in home sales, on which demand for power tools, flooring and other home improvement goods is dependent. In addition, job growth and lower gasoline prices have bolstered consumers' confidence. Home sales climbed 2.4 percent in September from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.17 million, the highest level of the year and the fifth increase in six months. The third-quarter results reflected a pretax gain of $100 million related to the sale of a portion of its ownership in HD Supply Holdings, its professional services division. They also reflected $28 million in expenses related to the data breach. But the retailer is still tallying costs of the breach, said Carol B. Tomé, Home Depot's chief financial officer. She said known expenses related to the attack, including legal costs and spending on security technology, would cost $27 million more in the fourth quarter, or $6 million after an expected insurance reimbursement. For the year, Home Depot expects to pay $34 million in costs related to the breach outside insurance reimbursement, Ms. Tomé said. Home Depot kept its outlook for the year unchanged, saying it expected diluted earnings per share to increase 21 percent, to about $4.54 a share, on sales growth of about 4.8 percent. That appeared to be a conservative estimate, given the executives' bullish tone before the holidays. Ms. Tomé said that she was impressed so far by November sales, and that colder weather was helping to produce even more sales to consumers seeking to protect their homes from severe weather. "
"A More Secure Credit Card, European-Style","LONDON -- On a recent morning, eager shoppers swarmed around Covent Garden, a 350-year-old former open-air vegetable market in central London whose glass-fronted stores now include popular American companies like Apple and Shake Shack. But when consumers here pulled out a credit card to make a purchase, they got an extra layer of security compared with most shoppers in the United States. A chip embedded into all credit and debit cards in Europe -- a technology known as E.M.V. -- has cut many forms of card fraud by more than 65 percent in the last decade.  ''At first, it was a little strange to use, but now it's become second nature,'' said Jennifer Spencer, 39, an office manager, who was at Covent Garden to get a head start on holiday shopping. ''I can't imagine paying for things in any other way.'' The technology, which has a microchip in the card and requires consumers to enter a PIN at checkout, has been required in Europe and some countries elsewhere for about a decade. Now, Americans retailers and banks are preparing for the wide release of the technology, in a wholesale security upgrade that will cost billions of dollars. The change will start next year and is expected to take several years to complete. The upgrade follows several major credit card data breaches at major retailers, including Target and Home Depot. And while security specialists say E.M.V. technology (named for Europay, MasterCard and Visa) will not stop hackers from targeting bank accounts, the new cards represent a significant improvement on how individuals' financial data is handled. The new credit and debit cards also bring the United States up to the security standards of the rest of the world. ''The U.S. is the weakest link in the payment chain,'' said Julie Conroy, research director in the retail banking unit of the Aite Group, a consulting firm in Boston. ''As card fraud has risen 30 percent annually in recent years, the business case to upgrade cards now makes sense.'' In response to consumer fears about future data breaches, major American retailers and banks are moving fast to introduce cards and checkout systems before October 2015, when the cost for fraudulent transactions will shift from banks to merchants if the merchants have not upgraded their equipment. Already, retailers like Walmart and Walgreens have outlined plans to issue E.M.V. store-branded credit cards. And President Obama announced in October that cards issued by the federal government would come with encrypted microchips and four-digit codes as standard, beginning in 2015. In total, roughly 70 percent of credit cards and 40 percent of debit cards are expected to use the technology by the end of next year, though the introduction of upgraded checkout systems will not be completed until the end of the decade. ''Companies now realize that this type of fraud represents a real and present danger,'' Ms. Conroy said. The major difference between older credit cards and E.M.V. cards will be a small embedded microchip that creates an individual transaction code when the card's owner makes an in-store payment. An individual's data is now stored on a card's magnetic strip, based on technology barely changed since the 1970s, that does not alter financial information between transactions. When copied, the strip allows thieves to readily falsify a person's personal details to make illegal purchases. That is not possible with the encrypted microchip that uses individual transaction codes. The technology, often called chip-and-PIN, also uses a four-digit code to verify transactions, though some banks will still rely on signatures to confirm an individual's identity in the United States. For those upgrading to codes, however, they must be entered to approve each purchase. rather than a signature. The code must be entered to approve each purchase. When combined with the secure microchips, these numeric codes make transactions roughly 700 times as secure as older payment methods, according to the Federal Reserve. ''The main reason to use these cards is to reduce fraud,'' said Jeremy Light, a managing director for payment services at the consultancy Accenture in London. ''When you make a chip-and-PIN purchase, it gives the consumer greater control over the entire transaction.'' While the technology is only starting to be introduced in the United States, most of Europe -- and emerging markets like Brazil and Mexico -- have relied on these highly secure cards for years. Security specialists say other parts of the world have been quicker to embrace E.M.V. cards because levels of financial fraud there were traditionally higher than those in the United States. In Britain, for example, roughly 14 cents out of every $100 was lost to card fraud in 2004 (when the technology was introduced), compared with just 5 cents in the United States, Aite said. Since the cards were adopted, British counterfeit and stolen card fraud has fallen roughly 60 percent, to $160 million, over the last decade while the same figures for the United States have jumped about 50 percent, to $3.2 billion, in the same period. Specialists warn, however, that the E.M.V. technology will not address all types of financial fraud. Although the encrypted microchips have led to a significant decline in counterfeit cards, they cannot stop illegal online purchases that do not require an individual to enter a four-digit code. Such purchases represent the fastest-growing area of financial fraud. The technology also would have not have stopped hackers from breaching companies like Target and Home Depot by gaining access to in-store cash register systems. But the microchip technology would have ensured that any data they pulled from customers' credit cards could not be used for future purchases, or to make counterfeit cards. ''Although E.M.V. on its own would not have stopped the full breach, it would have reduced the overall risk and consumer anger,'' said Gilles Ubaghs, a senior analyst at the technology research company Ovum. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Pizza Orders Reveal Credit Card Scheme, and a Secondhand Market","Twitter: @mwilsonnyt ''Who wants pizza?'' The seemingly harmless question raised suspicions among police officers in Brooklyn when they saw the query posed repeatedly on Facebook, by users whose profiles they were keeping an eye on because of suspected gang ties. The pizza question was sometimes accompanied by the red-and-blue Domino's logo. Officers contacted Domino's, and a bigger story came into focus, a curious blend of high-tech fraud and street-level word of mouth. With pepperoni and extra cheese.  ''They started seeing a record spike in sales,'' said Deputy Chief Kevin P. Harrington, the commanding officer of the grand larceny division. In short, thieves working through lists of stolen credit card numbers were using a smartphone app that orders pizza to see which numbers still worked. When they found a number to be valid, authorities said, the thieves used it to order bigger-ticket items online -- while people in pockets of Brownsville and East New York in Brooklyn ate the pizzas. Some warm, some cold. But all hot. The scheme was ''not to get free Domino's,'' Deputy Inspector Joseph Gulotta said, ''but free Domino's was the bottom line.'' One of the many kinds of identity theft is the black-market sale of stolen credit card numbers. No card is necessary: just the number and the three-digit security code that goes with it. A thief buys a list of those numbers. The next step is to see which ones have not been canceled. In Brooklyn, news spread of a way of doing this, according to Inspector Gulotta, a former commanding officer of a precinct in Brownsville. ''Word of mouth, social media,'' he said. ''It flies.'' Several people with no apparent connection to one another were using a Domino's smartphone app to order pizzas -- lots of pizzas, up to $50 per order -- in order after order, Inspector Gulotta said. The app allows the user to enter an address and a credit-card number, and presto, a short time later, along comes the pizza delivery. Investigators, working with a Domino's loss-prevention office, were able to determine which recent orders had been paid for with stolen credit card numbers. Days or weeks later, the rightful owners of the cards -- ''from all over the country,'' Inspector Gulotta said -- noticed that they had seemed to have bought a lot of pizza in Brooklyn, and contested the charges. Domino's was left to pay the credit cards back for its own pies. The police investigated the smartphones used in the pizza sales and found evidence of the scheme: a pattern of many unsuccessful credit card purchases -- denied because the cards had been canceled -- followed by a successful buy. ''This account has tried 50 attempts,'' Inspector Gulotta said of one phone. ''Two thousand attempts in the last month.'' Chief Harrington said it was believed that some of the pizzas were sold on the street. ''There is a secondary market for pizza,'' he said. The officers were able to identify the phones that placed the orders, and in a two-day sweep that began on Nov. 13, they arrested 14 people and charged them with petty larceny or identity theft or both. The suspects were male, with one exception, and predominantly from Brooklyn. The median age was 18. One of those arrested was Armani Skeete, a 17-year-old high school senior from Brownsville. ''I didn't order the pizza,'' he said in an interview this week. ''Someone ordered the pizza for me. The address was at my house.'' He was posed a rhetorical question: Doesn't he hate it when that happens? ''I didn't do anything,'' he said. On Nov. 13, he was talking to an acquaintance on the phone. ''He said, 'I'll get Domino's to your house,' '' Mr. Skeete said. ''He was saying how he had got Domino's before and he wanted to get it for me, and I didn't say no to Domino's.'' The buzzer rang, and he went downstairs for the pizza. ''It was a Domino's driver, and he asked me, 'Is this your pizza?' Next thing I know I got put in handcuffs and put in the police precinct.'' He never so much as caught a whiff of the pizza. He was peppered with questions. ''You ordered Domino's, you did whatever,'' he recalls being told. Mr. Skeete said he knew nothing of credit card schemes. The precinct house filled with other young men, he said. ''What are you in here for?'' one of them asked him. ''I got arrested for picking up a box of pizza from Domino's.'' The stranger replied, ''Oh, you too?'' Mr. Skeete was later given a desk appearance ticket and released. Calls to several Domino's chains in the neighborhood found no one aware of the scheme, which makes sense, because it all happened on the app. All callers are greeted with a recording urging customers to order anywhere, anytime with the pizza app, adding, ''Life just got a little easier.''
