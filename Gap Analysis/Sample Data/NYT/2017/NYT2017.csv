Ignoring a WhatsApp Scam,"Q. I signed up for WhatsApp out of curiosity last year but never used it. Today I got an email message about someone sending me a WhatsApp voice mail. Is this for real?  A. The random note about WhatsApp voice mail is most likely malware hiding behind a spoofed email message that has been dressed up with copies of the company's logo and typography. Versions of the voice-mail scam have been floating around the internet since at least 2013 in an attempt to get unsuspecting recipients to download malicious code to their computers and devices.    The WhatsApp site has a guide to dealing with ''strange messages'' and suspected hacking attempts on its site; one way to tell is to open the message header and look at the sender's real address. Panda Security is among the anti-malware sites with articles that describe various WhatApp scams to avoid.   As a communications service that claims one billion users in 180 countries, WhatsApp is a big target and joins large banks, social networking sites, credit card companies, the Internal Revenue Service and other institutions as potentially lucrative targets for hackers all over the world. Email, text message and phone scams constantly evolve, so taking a default position of distrust on any out-of-the-blue contact until you can verify it can help keep you safer.   It is also a good idea to be aware of the kinds of scams out there. The Federal Trade Commission has a page detailing some of the current hustles making the rounds (including the evergreen ''technical support'' con jobs). Installing security software (especially a program that scans incoming email for threats) on your computer and keeping it up-to-date is another line of defense.

Five Resolutions to Protect Your Devices From Attacks (and Nicks),"If 2017 taught you anything about personal technology, it's that the onus is on you to protect your personal data and devices. Tech companies aren't going to do that for you. (In fact, they are generally the ones failing you.) So why not make protecting yourself your New Year's resolution?    Last year, I recommended some resolutions for making your tech less frustrating, like doing regular maintenance on your devices, being a strategic shopper and purging the e-waste sitting around your home.   But this year's cybersecurity nightmares, from the ransomware attack to the Equifax hack, underscored the need to protect yourself. Here are some recommendations for living a safer digital life this new year.    Update Your Software   One of the most damaging cyberattacks this year involved ransomware, a form of malicious software that locks up people's data and threatens to destroy it if a ransom is not paid. In May, the ransomware known as WannaCry affected more than 200,000 Windows computers in 150 countries. Security experts believe the malware spread through machines by getting people to download it via email.   Here's the kicker: Microsoft had already released a security update that would have prevented the WannaCry malware from infecting machines. But the hacked computers were behind on downloading the updates. The cybercriminals generally targeted hospitals, academic institutions, blue-chip companies and businesses like movie theater chains. But this episode was an important reminder that keeping your software up to date is crucial.   This rule of thumb applies to anything that touches your information security: operating systems, antivirus software, your internet router, your password management app and your web browsers. Keep these important components up to date with the latest security enhancements, and you will be better off than most.   Read Privacy Policies   Amid Uber's laundry list of scandals, which included sexual harassment accusations and an undisclosed security breach, there was an important revelation that everyone can learn from. It involved Unroll.me, a free service that unsubscribes you from junk mail.   To gather intelligence about its competition, Uber bought information about its main rival, Lyft, from Unroll.me. How did Uber do that, exactly? Unroll.me scanned the contents of its users' inboxes and sold anonymized data, information that did not have individuals' names attached to it -- in this case, emailed Lyft receipts -- to Uber.   Many were shocked to learn about Unroll.me's business model. But the truth was always there in the fine print: the company's privacy policy clearly stated that ''we may collect, use, transfer, sell and disclose non-personal information for any purpose'' and that data can be used ''to build anonymous market research products and services.'' Still, people were understandably outraged by the misleading nature of Unroll.me. A company that promised to rid you of spam mail scanned your inbox and sold information about you to other companies, including marketers.   So make it a habit to read a company's privacy policy. As boring as it sounds, a bit of reading will go a long way. I recently considered using a free internet service for sending a fax, and upon reading the privacy policy I learned that the company collects sensitive information like Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. (I went out and found a traditional fax machine instead.)   Delete Unnecessary Apps   The Unroll.me episode also raised awareness of the sheer number of third-party apps that may be leeching off your personal information. There are probably apps and web services you don't remember downloading or subscribing to, and they could still have access to your data.   At least once a year, it's worthwhile to do an audit on your third-party apps. On your smartphone, delete apps that you have not touched in several months. For a clean break, in some cases you will also have to visit the company's website and request that your account be deleted entirely.   Also check your primary online accounts, like Facebook, Twitter or Google, to see which apps are hooked into them. Chances are you have used those accounts to quickly sign up for a web tool or app. The ones you never use may still be leeching off your personal data, so you should disable them.   On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to the account. On your Google account page, you can find a similar apps list labeled ''Connected apps & sites.'' And on Twitter, go to the Apps page under ''Settings and privacy.''   On my neglected Facebook account, for example, I had 82 connected apps. After removing many unused or defunct apps, like LivingSocial, Words With Friends and Draw Something, I had 32 left.   Use a VPN   In April, Congress voted to overturn privacy rules that would have made it more difficult for broadband providers like Comcast and Charter to track and sell information about your browsing history to advertisers. The stronger privacy rules never went into effect, meaning nothing changed. But the privacy repeal underlined the sheer magnitude of data that internet service providers can collect and share about you. Subscribing to a virtual private network, or VPN, is a meaningful safeguard for your online privacy.   When you browse the web, a broadband provider helps route your device's internet traffic to each destination website. Every device you use has an identifier consisting of a string of numbers, also known as an IP address. When you are on the internet, a service provider can see which devices you use and which sites you visit.   VPNs help cloak your browsing information from your internet provider. When you use VPN software, your device connects to a VPN provider's servers. That way, all your web traffic passes through the VPN provider's internet connection. So if your internet provider was trying to listen in on your web traffic, all it would see is the VPN server's IP address connected to the VPN service.   VPNs aren't perfect. They often slow down internet speeds significantly, and some apps or services don't work properly when you are connected to a VPN. But everybody can benefit from using a private network, especially in certain situations, like connecting to an open Wi-Fi network at a cafe or an airport.   Protect Your Hardware   Smartphones like Apple's iPhone X and Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 reached several milestones this year. Their screens look terrific, and they are incredibly fast -- and they are pricier than past smartphones. The iPhone X costs upward of $999, and the Galaxy Note 8 costs around $950. The downside is they are not more durable than previous phones.   The trend with these fancy new smartphones is to make the display take up as much of the face as possible. That means that a larger part of the body is composed of glass, which is susceptible to shattering. (The iPhone X even has a glass back so it can be charged wirelessly.) This trend is likely to continue, because people love having more screen.   So now is a good time to start investing in protecting your smartphone. Get a case or a screen protector -- or both. Screen protectors help protect screens from scratches, which weaken the structural integrity of a display and may eventually lead to large cracks. A good case will protect your phone from scratches and absorb impact in those areas when your device is dropped.     "
The Cyber Insecurity Company,"Jeanne Shaheen is a Democratic senator from New Hampshire. MADBURY, N.H. -- The Kremlin hacked our presidential election, is waging a cyberwar against our NATO allies and is probing opportunities to use similar tactics against democracies worldwide. Why then are federal agencies, local and state governments and millions of Americans unwittingly inviting this threat into their cyber networks and secure spaces? That threat is posed by antivirus and security software products created by Kaspersky Lab, a Moscow-based company with extensive ties to Russian intelligence. To close this alarming national security vulnerability, I am advancing bipartisan legislation to prohibit the federal government from using Kaspersky Lab software.     Kaspersky Lab insists that it has ''no inappropriate ties with any government.'' The company's products, which are readily available at big-box American retailers, have more than 400 million users around the globe. And it provides security services to major government agencies, including the Department of State, the National Institutes of Health and, reportedly, the Department of Defense.   But at a public hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee in May, six top  intelligence officials, including the heads of the F.B.I., C.I.A. and National Security Agency, were asked if they would be comfortable with Kaspersky Lab software on their agencies' computers. Each answered with an unequivocal no. I cannot disclose the classified assessments that prompted the intelligence chiefs' response. But it is unacceptable to ignore questions about Kaspersky Lab because the answers are shielded in classified materials. Fortunately, there is ample publicly available information to help Americans understand the reasons Congress has serious doubts about the company.   The firm's billionaire founder, Eugene Kaspersky, graduated from the elite cryptology institute of the K.G.B., the Soviet Union's main intelligence service, and was a software engineer for Soviet military intelligence. He vehemently dismisses concerns that his company assists Russia's intelligence agencies with cyberespionage and claims that he is the target of Cold War-style conspiracy theories. But Kaspersky Lab has committed missteps that reveal the true nature of its work with Russia's Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., a successor to the K.G.B.   Bloomberg recently reported on emails from October 2009 in which Mr. Kaspersky directs his staff to work on a secret project ''per a big request on the Lubyanka side,'' a reference to the F.S.B.'s Moscow offices. The McClatchy news service uncovered records of the official certification of Kaspersky Lab by Russian military intelligence, which experts in this field call ''persuasive public evidence'' of the company's links to the Russian government.   The challenge to United States national security grew last year when the company launched a proprietary operating system designed for electrical grids, pipelines, telecommunications networks and other critical infrastructure. The Defense Intelligence Agency recently warned American companies that this software could enable Russian government hackers to shut down critical systems.   Beyond the evidence of direct links between Mr. Kaspersky and the Russian government, we cannot ignore the indirect links inherent in doing business in the Russia of President Vladimir Putin, where oligarchs and tycoons have no choice but to cooperate with the Kremlin. Steve Hall, former C.I.A. station chief in Moscow, told a reporter: ''These guys' families, their well-being, everything they have is in Russia.'' He added that he had no doubt that Kaspersky Lab ''could be, if it's not already, under the control of Putin.''   The technical attributes of antivirus software amplify the dangers from Kaspersky Lab. Mr. Kaspersky might be correct when he says that his antivirus software does not contain a ''backdoor'': code that deliberately allows access to vulnerable information.   But a backdoor is not necessary. When a user installs Kaspersky Lab software, the company gets an all-access pass to every corner of a user's computer network, including all applications, files and emails. And because Kaspersky's servers are in Russia, sensitive United States data is constantly cycled through a hostile country. Under Russian laws and according to Kaspersky Lab's certification by the F.S.B., the company is required to assist the spy agency in its operations, and the F.S.B. can assign agency officers to work at the company. Russian law requires telecommunications service providers such as Kaspersky Lab to install communications interception equipment that allows the F.S.B. to monitor all of a company's data transmissions.   The Senate Armed Services Committee in June adopted my measure to prohibit the Department of Defense from using Kaspersky Lab software, to limit fallout from what I fear is already a huge breach of national security data. When broad defense legislation comes before the Senate in the weeks ahead, I hope to amend it to ban Kaspersky software from all of the federal government.   Americans were outraged by Russia's interference in our presidential election, but a wider threat is Russia's doctrine of hybrid warfare, which includes cybersabotage of critical American infrastructure from nuclear plants to electrical grids. Kaspersky Lab, with an active presence in millions of computer systems in the United States, is capable of playing a powerful role in such an assault. It's time to put a stop to this threat to our national security.   Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

Hacker Leaks Episodes From Netflix Show and Threatens Other Networks,"A hacker who claims to have stolen unreleased television shows from several major networks shared the coming season of the Netflix series ''Orange Is the New Black'' on Saturday after the person said the streaming service failed to meet its ransom requests. The breach appears to have occurred at the postproduction company Larson Studios, a popular digital-mixing service in Los Angeles for television networks and movie studios. The hacker or hackers, who go by the name ''thedarkoverlord,'' also claim to have stolen unreleased content from ABC, Fox, National Geographic and IFC. The Federal Bureau of Investigation learned of the episode at Larson Studios in January but did not start notifying the content companies until a month ago.     A message to Larson Studios was not immediately returned.   On Twitter, thedarkoverlord suggested that other networks would have their shows released next. ''Oh, what fun we're all going to have,'' the hacker said. ''We're not playing any games anymore.''   Netflix had announced this year that Season 5 of ''Orange Is the New Black'' would be released June 9, and it was not immediately clear whether it planned to move up the release date.   In a statement, Netflix said: ''We are aware of the situation. A production vendor used by several major TV studios had its security compromised and the appropriate law enforcement authorities are involved.''   The thefts are the latest in a long line of ransom and extortion attacks perpetuated by cybercriminals over the past year. Security experts have been responding, with greater frequency, to breaches in which these criminals threaten to expose or delete proprietary information unless companies pay a ransom.   Those threats have increased with the advent of ransomware, malicious software that encrypts victims' data and prevents them from accessing it until they pay a ransom, often hundreds or thousands of dollars' worth of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency. Ransomware attacks have increased in the past five years and were up 50 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, according to a data breach investigations report published last week by Verizon.   This specific breach highlights a risk posed by the weak security practices in the postproduction studios that manage the release of proprietary entertainment content. While companies like Netflix and Fox might invest in state-of-the-art cybersecurity defense technology, they must also rely on an ecosystem of postproduction vendors, ranging from mom-and-pop shops to more sophisticated outfits like Dolby and Technicolor, which may not deploy the same level of cybersecurity and threat intelligence.   The stolen content appears to be dated. In an online post, thedarkoverlord said it had obtained the first 10 episodes of Season 5 of ''Orange Is the New Black''; the breach occurred before the final three episodes were released to postproduction studios. The first episode was made public on a file-sharing site on Friday, which the hacker linked to via Twitter with a threat: ''Let's try to be a bit more direct, Netflix.'' The nine other episodes were released on Saturday.   In a message posted Saturday, thedarkoverlord criticized Netflix for not meeting its blackmail requests. ''It didn't have to be this way, Netflix,'' the message said. ''You're going to lose a lot more money in all of this than what our modest offer was.''   The statement continued: ''We're quite ashamed to breathe the same air as you. We figured a pragmatic business such as yourselves would see and understand the benefits of cooperating with a reasonable and merciful entity like ourselves.''   The hacker threatened to release content from other studios on Saturday if its demands were not met. ABC, Fox and IFC declined to comment, and a message to National Geographic was not immediately returned.   The alias thedarkoverlord has popped up in other recent attacks, including one last January on a small charity in Muncie, Ind., the Little Red Door Cancer Services of East Central Indiana. In that case, the hackers wiped the organization's servers and backup servers, and demanded 50 bitcoins -- valued at $43,000 -- to restore the data. The organization did not pay.   Last summer, the same hacker claimed to have breached at least three health care companies in the United States and a health insurer, and attempted to sell their stolen data on the dark web, on a website called TheRealDeal, for $96,000 to $490,000.

"Google's Security Key Works, With Limits","Why won't the password just go away? The silly pet names, movie titles or sports teams that many people punch in to get into their online accounts are a weak spot that hackers continue to puncture. Yet passwords remain the primary way we log in to online accounts containing our personal and financial information. Google has a new pragmatic solution: Embrace the password, but lock it down with extra physical security.    The company this month released its Advanced Protection Program, which is meant to make stealing your password pointless. To use it, you'll need two inexpensive physical keys to log in to your Google account on your computer and smartphone.   This way, even if hackers stole your password in a data breach or successfully phished for it, by tempting you to hand over your credentials on a fake login page, they couldn't do anything unless they got their hands on the keys as well. And minimizing risk with minimal effort is a boon to anyone who cares about online security.    ''I am a big fan of this,'' said John Sabin, a former hacker for the National Security Agency. ''It's probably the easiest and most secure multifactor for the masses.''   The physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you. Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.   After the attack, Google's security team came up with a motto: ''Never again.'' The company later rolled out two-factor authentication for Google customers' Gmail accounts. It involved text messaging a unique code to your phone that you must type in after entering your password in order to log in.   Unfortunately, those text messages can be hijacked. Last month, security researchers at Positive Technologies, a security firm, demonstrated how they could use vulnerabilities in the cellular network to intercept text messages for a set period of time.   The idea of Google's Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message. Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.   But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group? Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.   So we tested Google's Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses. The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys. But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.   Setting Up Advanced Protection   Anyone with a Google account can sign up for the security program on Google's Advanced Protection webpage. To get started, you will have to buy two physical keys for about $20 each. Google recommends buying one from Feitian and another from Yubico.   The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you. To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it. (The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.) This process takes a few minutes.   On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins. That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.   But there are trade-offs. Google's Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys. For the time being, that means only Google's Gmail mail app, Google's Backup and Sync app, and Google's Chrome browser.   On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Google's Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser. So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, you're out of luck. Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.   Testing the Security   Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.   Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A. hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons. On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.   On the other hand, if you lose the keys or don't have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account. Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account. In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.   Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle. She said Google's requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.   But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account. That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.   Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Google's program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.   ''It's something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys,'' Ms. Sandvik said. ''I don't see a reason you shouldn't turn this on.''   The Bottom Line   While the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.   It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Google's apps from Apple's and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Google's mail, messaging and cloud storage services. But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature -- Apple's V.I.P. alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you. Google's iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature. For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P. alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.   Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which won't work with the keys.   If using Google's security program would disrupt your work, you may want to wait for more companies to update their apps to support the keys, which rely on a standard called FIDO, for Fast Identity Online. Mr. Sabin predicts that many apps will follow Google's lead.   If you decide to wait, don't procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages. While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.   The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well. When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Google's keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: ''No comment.''     "
Global Cyberattack: What We Know and Don't Know,"A quickly spreading ransomware attack is hitting countries across the world including France, Russia, Spain, Ukraine and the United States, just weeks after a ransomware attack known as WannaCry. What We Know     Several private companies have confirmed that they were hit by the attack, including the American pharmaceutical giant Merck, the Danish shipping company AP Moller-Maersk, the British advertising firm WPP, the French multinational Saint-Gobain and the Russian steel, mining and oil companies Evraz and Rosneft.    Photographs and videos of computers affected by the attack show a message of red text on a black screen. The message read: ''Oops, your important files have been encrypted. If you see this text then your files are no longer accessible because they have been encrypted. Perhaps you are busy looking to recover your files but don't waste your time.''     Kaspersky Lab, a cybersecurity firm based in Moscow, reported that about 2,000 computer systems had been affected by the new ransomware.    Cybersecurity researchers first called the new ransomware attack Petya, as it bore similarities to a ransomware strain known by that name, which was first reported by Kasperksy in March 2016. But Kaspersky later said that its investigation into the new attack found that it was a type of ransomware that had never been seen before.    ESET, a Slovakia-based cybersecurity company, said the first known infection occurred early on June 27, through a Ukrainian software company called MeDoc. MeDoc denied that its program was the initial infection point. In a Facebook post, the firm wrote, ''At the time of updating the program, the system could not be infected with the virus directly from the update file,'' though an earlier message confirmed that its systems had been compromised.    Symantec, a Silicon Valley cybersecurity firm, confirmed that the ransomware was infecting computers through at least one exploit, or vulnerability to computer systems, known as Eternal Blue.    Eternal Blue was leaked online last April by a mysterious group of hackers known as the Shadow Brokers, who have previously released hacking tools used by the National Security Agency. That vulnerability was used in May to spread the WannaCry ransomware, which affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries.    ESET and several other cybersecurity companies have identified at least one other exploit used in the attack known as PsExec, which takes advantage of a single computer that has not been updated with the latest software in a network to spread infections by looking for -- and using -- administrative credentials. By using PsExec, the ransomware continued spreading across systems that had been updated, or patched, after the WannaCry outbreak last month.    Several cybersecurity researchers have identified a Bitcoin address to which the attackers are demanding a payment of $300 from their victims. At least some of the victims appear to be paying the ransom, even though the email address used by the attackers has been shut down. That removes the possibility that the attackers could restore a victim's access to their computer networks, even once ransom is paid.   What We Don't Know    Who is behind the ransomware attack. The original Petya ransomware was developed and used by cybercriminals, and variations have been sold through dark web trading sites, which are accessible only by using browsers that mask a user's identity, making it difficult for cybersecurity researchers to track.    The motives for the attack. Cybersecurity researchers ask why, if the goal of the attack was to force victims to pay ransom, more care was not taken to protect the email address through which attackers could communicate with their victims, or to provide multiple avenues for payment.    How much bigger this attack will get. Cybersecurity researchers say that like WannaCry, the ransomware infects computers using vulnerabilities in the central nerve of a computer, called a kernel, making it difficult for antivirus firms to detect. It also has the ability to take advantage of a single unpatched computer on a network to infect computers across a vast network, meaning that even systems that were updated after WannaCry could potentially become vulnerable again.   What Is Ransomware?    Ransomware is one of the most popular forms of online attack today. It typically begins with attackers sending their victims email that includes a link or a file that appears innocuous but contains dangerous malware.    Once a victim clicks on the link or opens the attachment, the computer becomes infected. The program encrypts the computer, essentially locking the user out of files, folders and drives on that computer. In some cases, the entire network the computer is connected to can become infected.    The victim then receives a message demanding payment in exchange for attackers unlocking the system. The payment is usually requested in Bitcoin, a form of digital currency.   Follow Sheera Frenkel on Twitter @sheeraf.     "
How to Defend Your Home From Internet Hijackers,"MODERN homes today are getting internet-connected light bulbs, thermostats, TVs and speakers. So with a simple voice command or the touch of a button on our smartphones, we can set the temperature, turn on a light or prepare the TV to record a program. What could go wrong?    A lot more than most people are prepared for, it turns out. If one of these devices gets hijacked, hackers could potentially snoop around for sensitive data like financial or health information. Or they could use a network of compromised devices to perform a widespread attack that takes down major websites, which is what happened last October.   The good news is that so far, online attacks on home devices are relatively uncommon. Only 10 percent of American consumers said they were victims of the crime in a recent study done for the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company. However, those who experienced such an attack through their home gadgets reported losses of $1,000 to $5,000 from the incidents.    ''There's still this whole sort of, 'Gee whiz, it's so cool' thing that's going on'' with internet-connected home appliances, said Lee Tien, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights. ''That's also what often gets us into trouble.''   As smart home devices become more popular, they will become bigger targets for hackers. So it behooves us to get ahead of the curve by securing our home appliances, using these tips from security experts who have closely studied smart home accessories.   Research Before You Buy   When shopping for an internet-connected home device like a smart speaker, lighting system or television set, a good rule of thumb is to go with a trusted brand.   Larger, well-regarded companies like Amazon or Google have a background in developing products with security in mind, said Liviu Arsene, an analyst for Bitdefender, which sells security hardware for protecting smart home accessories. Before buying a product, consumers should do a web search on it to see if the company regularly issues software updates that fix security vulnerabilities, he said.   People should also carefully read company privacy policies. David Britton, a vice president in the fraud and identity department of Experian, the credit reporting agency, said people should be curious about whether companies themselves were a threat to user privacy.   ''What are they capturing about you?'' he said. ''Is the data leaving the device? Is it being sent back to the mother ship?''   Consider the smart speakers from Amazon and Google. Amazon said its Alexa smart assistant, which is used in its Echo speakers, automatically downloads software updates to defend against new security threats. Data from the Echo is also uploaded to Amazon's servers only after people utter the wake word ''Alexa,'' the company said. That minimizes the likelihood that the device will record conversations unrelated to requests intended for Alexa.   Google said its Home speaker similarly issued regular software updates and employed advanced security features, like a technique that disables the device if its software is tampered with. The company added that the speaker processed speech only after the words ''O.K. Google'' or ''Hey Google'' were detected.   But other large brands occasionally engage in behavior that customers may find objectionable. The smart TV maker Vizio, for example, made headlines with revelations from the investigative news site ProPublica that it kept a detailed record of customer viewing habits and shared it with advertisers, who could then use the information to identify other devices you owned.   Strengthen Your Wi-Fi Security   Your Wi-Fi network is the pulse of your smart home, thus it is a vulnerable attack point. Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene suggest connecting all your smart home accessories -- for example, your Amazon Echo, Nest thermostat, Samsung smart refrigerator and Philips Hue smart lights -- onto a Wi-Fi network that is separate from the one connected to your computing devices, like your smartphone, tablet and computer.   With two distinct Wi-Fi networks, it will be harder for a hacker to jump from infiltrating your smart accessory on one network to a personal computer on the other network, Mr. Arsene said.   The easiest way to create a second Wi-Fi network is to make a guest network. Many modern Wi-Fi routers, like TP-Link's Archer C7 (the top router recommended by The Wirecutter, a product recommendations site owned by The New York Times), include the ability to host a network for guests that uses a name and password different from that of your primary network. Quarantining your smart speakers, lights and TV onto a guest network will allow them all to interact with one another, while keeping your computing devices safer in the event that any of the smart accessories are hacked.   If you are paranoid about your Wi-Fi network being hacked, you can also change the Wi-Fi router's network settings to disable broadcasting the network name entirely, Mr. Britton said. That would make it difficult for a hacker driving by to detect and compromise your network, though it would also require house guests to manually type in your network name and password when they log on to your Wi-Fi.   Beef Up Your Wimpy Passwords   The same security principles for websites apply to the so-called internet of things. You should set strong, unique passwords for logging into each device you own. If you recycle your passwords and one device is compromised, the others can be, too.   A strong password can be a random string of characters or a nonsensical phrase with numbers and special characters. (Examples: My favorite number is Green4782# or The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224%.)   If you cannot memorize your passwords, that is a good thing: That means they are hard for hackers to crack. Keep them written down on a piece of paper and stored in a safe place, or store your passwords in a password-managing app like 1Password or LastPass.   Regularly Audit Appliances for Updates   While reputable manufacturers of smart home accessories offer software updates to patch security vulnerabilities, it is often up to the consumer to stay on top of updates. Because it lacks a screen, a smart light bulb or an internet-connected power socket is going to have a tough time informing you that it needs a software update.   Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene recommend that consumers regularly log into the mobile apps or websites for their smart home accessories to check if they need software updates. If updates are available, install them immediately.   When in Doubt, Hit Mute   Among security researchers, putting a piece of tape over a computer webcam has become a tongue-in-cheek recommendation for those who are extra paranoid about their privacy. (Even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, does it.)   With smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, there is an equivalent: a mute button to disable the device microphone so it can no longer listen. In the unlikely event that a device is hijacked, muting the microphone could help prevent hackers from listening to your conversations, Mr. Britton said.   Or you could go the safest route and opt out of having these devices at all. That was the method chosen by Mr. Tien, the lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who previously studied the privacy risks of smart meters, the devices that utility companies use to monitor energy consumption.   He said he accepted the privacy implications of owning a smartphone, but a smart home accessory?   ''I think it's sort of asking to have your privacy invaded to have something like that,'' he said. ''I'm not sure that the value of it is really all that great.''     "
Protecting Your Computer with Free Software,"Q. Are those free PC antivirus programs safe to use? A. The web is full of choices, but if you are looking for free protection for your computer, go with a program from an established security software company. You can find roundups and reviews online and the AV-Test.org site has a list of well-known software creators. Programs that pepper your screen with pop-ups or try to convince you that your computer is full of worms and viruses are often spyware or scams themselves.     Several companies offer free basic versions of their more complete security suites to home users -- including Avast, AVG, Bitdefender, Sophos and ZoneAlarm. As the range of malicious software has expanded to other computing platforms, some companies now offer free tools for the Mac and mobile platforms as well; Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac is among the options. Free apps that specifically protect against ransomware (like Bitdefender's Anti-Ransomware Tool for Windows) can also be found.   When browsing for software, make sure you are actually getting a copy of the company's free antivirus tool -- and not just the free trial version of a more comprehensive paid program. Depending on the program, you may be asked to share user data for research or see ads and upgrade offers within the free software. Paid versions typically provide more comprehensive protections, like network or game scanning.   Microsoft makes its own antivirus software for its Windows systems. If it is not already installed, Windows 7 users can download the Microsoft Security Essentials program from the company's site. The current version of Windows 10 comes with the Windows Defender Security Center for blocking viruses and other threats; go to the Settings app and open the Update & Security icon to check your coverage. (Apple builds in protective features like app-screening and anti-phishing alerts into its Mac OS software, but a third-party program goes further.)   Security software can help block malicious code from invading your computer, but be on guard for more socially engineered attacks from email and other online sources.

Ransomware: How Hackers Hold Data Hostage,"Right Now: Unknown hackers launched simultaneous attacks against computer systems around the world, holding vital information for ransom and throwing government agencies, businesses and hospitals into chaos. â-  More than 45,000 attacks have been recorded in as many as 74 countries, including Russia, Turkey, Vietnam, the Philippines and Japan, according to Kaspersky Labs, a Russian cybersecurity firm.    â-  Among the companies and government agencies affected were FedEx, Britain's National Health Service and the Russian Interior Ministry.    What We Know   â-  Hackers appeared to have exploited a flaw in Microsoft's Windows operating system that was first discovered by the United States National Security Agency. The flaw and a tool to exploit it with malicious software were made public in April by a hacker collective known as Shadow Brokers.   â-  At least 16 British hospitals and other facilities seemed to be hit hardest by the attacks, which blocked doctors from gaining access to patient files and caused emergency rooms to divert patients. Prime Minister Theresa May said there was no evidence that patient data had been compromised.   â-  Workers at those hospitals, a Spanish telecommunications firm and elsewhere were confronted with a message on their monitors that read, ''Ooops, your files have been encrypted!'' and demanded $300 in Bitcoin, an anonymous digital currency preferred by criminals, to restore access.   â-  The Russian Interior Ministry confirmed in a statement that 1,000 of its computers had also been hit.   â-  A FedEx spokesman said of the attack: ''Like many other companies, FedEx is experiencing interference with some of our Windows-based systems caused by malware. We are implementing remediation steps as quickly as possible. We regret any inconvenience to our customers.''   â-  Cybersecurity experts identified the malicious software as a variant of ransomware known as WannaCry.   â-  Reports last year found that some state-run hospitals in Britain had spent nothing on cyberdefense and were running outdated software on their systems.   What Is Ransomware?   â-  In a typical attack, hackers send their victims an email that includes a link to what appears to be for an innocuous web address or email attachment. In this case, attackers appear to have sent their victims encrypted .zip file attachments intended to make it more difficult to detect their nefarious purpose.   â-  Victims who click on that attachment soon find their computers infected. The program encrypts files, folders, and drives on the computer -- and potentially the entire networks to which they are connected. ''Users and organizations are generally not aware they have been infected until they can no longer access their data or until they begin to see computer messages advising them of the attack and demands for a ransom payment in exchange for a decryption key,'' according to the F.B.I.   â-  The messages that victims receive include directions for paying the attackers a ransom. Payment is typically demanded, as it was in the most recent string of attacks, in bitcoin.   â-  Microsoft in March recognized a potential flaw in its servers that allowed ransomware and other malicious software to spread on networks.   â-  A hospital in Los Angeles was similarly attacked in February of last year, paying a bitcoin ransom equivalent to about $17,000 to hackers who used malware to hold its computer system hostage.   What We Don't Know   â-  Who is behind the attack? While the Shadow Broker hackers released one of the tools used in the attack, it is not clear who orchestrated Friday's attacks. It is also not clear who the Shadow Broker hackers are. Initially, an insider at the N.S.A. or the C.I.A. was suspected of having leaked the agency's hacking tools, but the hackings continued after an N.S.A. contractor was arrested. Security experts have said that the timing of the hackers' data dumps often align with Russian political interests. For instance, one of the latest Shadow Broker dumps occurred after the United States bombed Syria. Hackers cited the bombing as part of the impetus for their latest leak.   â-  Has anyone paid the ransom? Security experts said those who had already fallen victim to ransomware on Friday may have little recourse. Jason Rebholz, a senior director at Crypsis Group, which specializes in ransomware, said victims could try to search the web for a decryption service, but chances are that in a sophisticated attack like this one, cybercriminals had already taken steps to immunize their encryption from such services.   â-  Has anyone been harmed? Emergency rooms, doctors' offices and ambulances were disrupted in Britain and communications were affected in other countries. It is still unknown if anyone suffered further injury or died because of the disruption.   For more breaking news and in-depth reporting, follow @nytimesworld on Twitter.

Brother and Sister Charged With Hacking Prominent Italians,"ROME -- It could have made an entertaining spy movie, if it wasn't disturbingly real: The Italian police say a brother and sister for years hacked into the phones and computers of the top tiers of Italian society -- from high-ranking government officials, to business leaders to Freemasons and even Vatican prelates. On Wednesday, the brother and sister, Giulio Occhionero, 45, and Francesca Maria Occhionero, 49, appeared before a judge here. They are accused of illegally accessing classified information, and breaching and intercepting information technology systems and data communications.     The police said the charges described an unprecedented cyberattack on prominent Italian institutions and individuals.   Information gleaned from the breaches was stored on servers in the United States, police officials said, and inquiries continue with the assistance of the F.B.I.'s cyberdivision.   The police here said their investigation began when a public official alerted them after receiving a suspicious email.   Lawyers for the siblings, who moved between residences in London and Rome and were arrested on Tuesday, dismissed the accusations as unfounded.   But even as details of the investigation -- called Eye Pyramid after the name of the malware used to hack into thousands of accounts -- were revealed by the Italian news media, the motives remained murky, while criticism mounted over the relative ease with which confidential accounts were breached.   ''There is no doubt that this case shows how the country's cybersecurity system is still lagging behind,'' Antonello Soro, president of the Italian Data Protection Authority, told an Italian radio station on Wednesday. The breach ''is the tip of the iceberg of the fragility of the system,'' he said. Security measures have not kept up with the increasing risks, he said, adding that ''cyberattacks have been growing by 30 percent a year.''   Investigators said in a statement that the Occhioneros had managed to infiltrate the accounts of more than 18,000 individuals, ''allowing the massive theft of contents.''   The accounts belonged to ''a galaxy of individuals'' including politicians, in current and past governments, and other people ''of national importance,'' the statement said. It is unclear whether any money was stolen in the cyberattacks.   The Occhioneros used a data network based in the United States as ''a way to hide the origins and lose track of the delinquent activities,'' said Ivano Gabrielli, an official with the Italian cyberpolice unit that investigated the case. He noted that Ms. Occhionero had dual citizenship and had lived in the United States.   An Italian request to examine the servers in the United States has been formally submitted, he said, adding that new developments were likely to emerge once the data was made available.   The Italian police have focused their investigation on the brother and sister, who were well known in the country's financial circles for their work on computer-based investment tools. For now, Mr. Gabrielli said, ''there is no evidence of the involvement of other people.''   But cybercrime analysts noted that whatever information the Occhioneros were gathering had to be interesting to someone to have any value.   ''What's still unclear is who had ultimate access to the information, whether it was gathered for the Italian market, or whether it was to be delivered outside,'' said Raffaele Marchetti, coordinator of the digital revolution and cybersecurity courses at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome.   He said it was unlikely that the siblings were acting alone. ''That kind of information is useless unless you have an institutional or financial contact that has some interest in having it,'' Mr. Marchetti said. ''Them, alone, isolated without contacts is an unreasonable story. We should expect more worrying information to emerge, who actually took advantage of this information and who backed, supported or gave coverage to these operations.''   Italian observers noted that intelligence gathering for an advantage in, say, business or politics was not a new phenomenon here. ''In the service of who or what and serving what end?'' asked the columnist Guido Gentili in an editorial on Wednesday in the newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore. ''The investigations will tell us but the impression remains that Italy once again is displaying, at the nexus of institutions, politics and business, one of its worst aspects: that of compiling dossiers, unauthorized surveillance and illegal collecting of private personal and professional information.''   Italian news media also noted Mr. Occhionero's affiliation with Freemasonry. Several of the accounts that were violated belonged to fellow masons, and the hacking could have been motivated by an ambition to acquire positions within the organization, some newspapers suggested.   Some analysts went further, offering comparisons with the Propaganda Due, or P2, scandal involving a masonic lodge that in the 1970s gathered so much secret information and recruited so many top Italians officials that it was referred to as a ''state within a state.''   Stefano Bisi, who is Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Italy, the country's principal Masonic organization, said that ''a lot of water had passed under the bridge'' since the P2 scandal, and that in fact ''masons were the victims'' of Mr. Occhionero's cyberattacks. Mr. Bisi was among those whose computers were hacked, but he said he could not imagine what Mr. Occhionero ''could have been looking for.''   Mr. Occhionero denies any wrongdoing, his lawyer, Stefano Parretta, said Wednesday. He explained that his client had servers abroad ''for business reasons,'' and that the large box of files found in Mr. Occhionero's garage were simply his company's accounting books.   Ms. Occhionero's lawyer, Roberto Bottachiari, told the Italian news agency ANSA that she ''didn't even know how to use a computer.''   Mr. Marchetti, the cybersecurity expert, said, ''The idea of gathering information has happened in Italy many times before.'' And on every occasion, ''it highlights the dark side of that kind of world,'' he said. ''It's worrying.''     "
What We Know and Don't Know About the Equifax Online Breach,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Last week, the consumer credit reporting company Equifax revealed that it had discovered a breach in its online systems that potentially impacted 143 million consumers. But many details about the breach and the computer security defenses at Equifax are still unclear. What We Know      Hackers exploited a vulnerability in website software. They gained access to certain files containing names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver's license numbers. Equifax also said the thieves lifted credit card numbers for about 209,000 consumers.    The breach was open from mid-May to July 29. That was when Equifax first detected it. The company said it had immediately worked to stop the intrusion and hired an outside firm to determine the scope and causes of the breach. It has not disclosed the name of the consulting firm.    The hack involved a known vulnerability in software used by Equifax. The New York Post first reported that hackers had exploited a vulnerability in Apache Struts, a kind of open-source software that companies like Equifax use to build websites.   On Thursday, Equifax confirmed that the breach involved a bug in Apache Struts, and identified the specific vulnerability. This security weakness was publicly identified in March and a patch to fix it had been available since then. That means Equifax could have worked to plug the hole using readily available instructions two months before the breach occurred but did not.   The rules for commercial use of open-source software can vary. Generally speaking, open-source software is built collaboratively by developers inside companies, academia and even hobbyists, and is available for free or at a low cost. Different types of Apache software are widely used all over the world.   What We Don't Know    It is not clear who had access to the website software exploited by the hackers. Although Equifax said that the hackers had exploited the vulnerability in a ''U.S. website application,'' that does not mean it was one of the company's public-facing websites. It could mean that the exploited software was only available to Equifax employees. If that was the case, the hackers who exploited the flaw could have had access to the company's private network.    It is also unclear why the company did not patch the vulnerability and why other security methods failed to stop the attack. Within three days of the vulnerability being revealed, public reports said that hackers were already exploiting the bug on websites. Had Equifax followed the advice of the community of software developers who oversee Struts, ''this breach would not have occurred,'' said Oege de Moor, the chief executive of the security firm Semmle.   Mr. de Moor said that the publicly available instructions for patching the bug were ''clear and simple.''   But there are other ways of guarding against potential attacks. Avivah Litan, a security analyst with the research firm Gartner, said that the bug alone was not to blame. ''You have to have layered security controls,'' Ms. Litan said. ''You have to assume that your prevention methods are going to fail.''    The perpetrators of the Equifax breach have not been identified. A group of hackers calling themselves the ''PastHole Hacking Team'' has claimed responsibility, and threatened to release the data on Friday if their ransom demand of 600 Bitcoin -- roughly $2.5 million -- is not met. In posts and communications with security researchers, members of the team claimed they were able to garner far more data than they expected when they targeted Equifax.    That doesn't mean this group of hackers was really responsible. Intelligence officials and security analysts in private industry said that while it is far too early to say definitively who breached Equifax, the leading theory is that the company was hit by a nation-state or hackers operating on a nation-state's behalf. They point to the sheer scale of theft, which most likely would have required a heightened degree of sophistication to pull off without being detected.   Other security experts said it would be smart to consider motivation and intent. ''Are cybercriminals going to try and sell circa 150 million records in dark web auctions? That's nearly half the population of the United States,'' said Thomas Boyden, president of GRA Quantum, a company that specialized in cyberattack incident response. ''Are there standard cybercriminals out there with the purchasing power for that type of data?''   Still, the detailed personal and financial information collected by a company like Equifax can be resold on the so-called Deep Web. It is much more valuable than credit card numbers, because it has a longer life span and can be used to access all kinds of other information, like bank accounts, loan details and medical records.    Have these hackers struck before? Mr. Boyden and others said that the breach had many parallels with previous breaches of personal information by nation-states and their contractors. Such government-affiliated hackers compile giant databases of stolen information to see if there is material that can be used for espionage or perhaps even blackmail. Using data-sifting technologies, they comb through massive collections of information to find useful material.     "
Hackers Use Tool Taken From N.S.A. in Global Attack,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Hackers exploiting malicious software stolen from the National Security Agency executed damaging cyberattacks on Friday that hit dozens of countries worldwide, forcing Britain's public health system to send patients away, freezing computers at Russia's Interior Ministry and wreaking havoc on tens of thousands of computers elsewhere. The attacks amounted to an audacious global blackmail attempt spread by the internet and underscored the vulnerabilities of the digital age.    Transmitted via email, the malicious software locked British hospitals out of their computer systems and demanded ransom before users could be let back in -- with a threat that data would be destroyed if the demands were not met.    By late Friday the attacks had spread to more than 74 countries, according to security firms tracking the spread. Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity firm, said Russia was the worst-hit, followed by Ukraine, India and Taiwan. Reports of attacks also came from Latin America and Africa.   The attacks appeared to be the largest ransomware assault on record, but the scope of the damage was hard to measure. It was not clear if victims were paying the ransom, which began at about $300 to unlock individual computers, or even if those who did pay would regain access to their data.   Security experts described the attacks as the digital equivalent of a perfect storm. They began with a simple phishing email, similar to the one Russian hackers used in the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other targets last year. They then quickly spread through victims' systems using a hacking method that the N.S.A. is believed to have developed as part of its arsenal of cyberweapons. And finally they encrypted the computer systems of the victims, locking them out of critical data, including patient records in Britain.   The connection to the N.S.A. was particularly chilling. Starting last summer, a group calling itself the ''Shadow Brokers'' began to post software tools that came from the United States government's stockpile of hacking weapons.   The attacks on Friday appeared to be the first time a cyberweapon developed by the N.S.A., funded by American taxpayers and stolen by an adversary had been unleashed by cybercriminals against patients, hospitals, businesses, governments and ordinary citizens.   Something similar occurred with remnants of the ''Stuxnet'' worm that the United States and Israel used against Iran's nuclear program nearly seven years ago. Elements of those tools frequently appear in other, less ambitious attacks.   The United States has never confirmed that the tools posted by the Shadow Brokers belonged to the N.S.A. or other intelligence agencies, but former intelligence officials have said that the tools appeared to come from the N.S.A.'s ''Tailored Access Operations'' unit, which infiltrates foreign computer networks. (The unit has since been renamed.)   The attacks on Friday are likely to raise significant questions about whether the growing number of countries developing and stockpiling cyberweapons can avoid having those same tools purloined and turned against their own citizens.   They also showed how easily a cyberweapon can wreak havoc, even without shutting off a country's power grid or its cellphone network.   In Britain, hospitals were locked out of their systems and doctors could not call up patient files. Emergency rooms were forced to divert people seeking urgent care.   In Russia, the country's powerful Interior Ministry, after denying reports that its computers had been targeted, confirmed in a statement that ''around 1,000 computers were infected,'' which it described as less than 1 percent of its total. The ministry, which oversees Russia's police forces, said technicians had contained the attack.   Some intelligence officials were dubious about that announcement because they suspect Russian involvement in the theft of the N.S.A. tools.   But James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said he suspected that criminals operating from Eastern Europe acting on their own were responsible. ''This doesn't look like state activity, given the targets that were hit,'' he said.   Those targets included corporate computer systems in many other countries -- including FedEx in the United States, one of the world's leading international shippers, as well as Spain's Telefónica and Russia's MegaFon telecom giant.   It could take months to find who was behind the attacks -- a mystery that may go unsolved. But they alarmed cybersecurity experts everywhere, reflecting the enormous vulnerabilities to internet invasions faced by disjointed networks of computer systems.   There is no automatic way to ''patch'' their weaknesses around the world.   ''When people ask what keeps you up at night, it's this,'' said Chris Camacho, the chief strategy officer at Flashpoint, a New York security firm tracking the attacks. Mr. Camacho said he was particularly disturbed at how the attacks spread like wildfire through corporate, hospital and government networks.   Another security expert, Rohyt Belani, the chief executive of PhishMe, an email security company, said the wormlike capability of the malware was a significant shift from previous ransom attacks. ''This is almost like the atom bomb of ransomware,'' Mr. Belani said, warning that the attack ''may be a sign of things to come.''   The hackers' weapon of choice on Friday was Wanna Decryptor, a new variant of the WannaCry ransomware, which encrypts victims' data, locks them out of their systems and demands ransoms.   Researchers said the impact and speed of Friday's attacks had not been seen in nearly a decade, when the Conficker computer worm infected millions of government, business and personal computers in more than 190 countries, threatening to overpower the computer networks that controlled health care, air traffic and banking systems over the course of several weeks.   One reason the ransomware on Friday was able to spread so quickly was that the stolen N.S.A. hacking tool, known as ''Eternal Blue,'' affected a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows servers.   Hours after the Shadow Brokers released the tool last month, Microsoft assured users that it had already included a patch for the underlying vulnerability in a software update in March.   But Microsoft, which regularly credits researchers who discover holes in its products, curiously would not say who had tipped the company off to the issue. Many suspected that the United States government itself had told Microsoft, after the N.S.A. realized that its hacking method exploiting the vulnerability had been stolen.   Privacy activists said if that were the case, the government would be to blame for the fact that so many companies were left vulnerable to Friday's attacks. It takes time for companies to roll out systemwide patches, and by notifying Microsoft of the hole only after the N.S.A.'s hacking tool was stolen, activists say the government would have left many hospitals, businesses and governments susceptible.   ''It would be deeply troubling if the N.S.A. knew about this vulnerability but failed to disclose it to Microsoft until after it was stolen,'' Patrick Toomey, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said on Friday. ''These attacks underscore the fact that vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and criminals around the world.''   During the Obama administration, the White House created a process to review software vulnerabilities discovered by intelligence agencies, and to determine which should be ''stockpiled'' for future offensive or defensive cyberoperations and which should be reported to the companies so that they could be fixed.   Last year the administration said that only a small fraction were retained by the government. But this vulnerability appeared to be one of them, and it was patched only recently, suggesting that the N.S.A. may have concluded the tool had been stolen and therefore warned Microsoft.   But that was clearly too little, and far too late.   On Friday, hackers took advantage of the fact that vulnerable targets -- particularly hospitals -- had yet to patch their systems, either because they had ignored advisories from Microsoft or because they were using outdated software that Microsoft no longer supports or updates.   The malware was circulated by email. Targets were sent an encrypted, compressed file that, once loaded, allowed the ransomware to infiltrate its targets. The fact that the files were encrypted ensured that the ransomware would not be detected by security systems until employees opened them, inadvertently allowing the ransomware to replicate across their employers' networks.   Employees at Britain's National Health Service had been warned about the ransomware threat earlier on Friday. But it was too late. As the disruptions rippled through at least 36 hospitals, doctors' offices and ambulance companies across Britain, the health service declared the attack a ''major incident,'' warning that local health services could be overwhelmed.   Britain's health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was briefed by cybersecurity experts, while Prime Minister Theresa May's office said on television that ''we're not aware of any evidence that patient data has been compromised.''   As the day wore on, dozens of companies across Europe, Asia and the United States discovered that they had been hit with the ransomware when they saw criminals' messages on their computer screens demanding $300 to unlock their data. But the criminals designed their ransomware to increase the ransom amount on a set schedule and threatened to erase the hostage data after a predetermined cutoff time, raising the urgency of the attack and increasing the likelihood that victims would pay.   Without the ability to decrypt their data on their own, security experts said that victims who had not backed up their data were faced with a choice: Either live without their data or pay. It was not clear how many victims ultimately paid.   Security experts advised companies to immediately update their systems with the Microsoft patch.   Until organizations use the Microsoft patch, Mr. Camacho said, they could continue to be hit -- not just by ransomware, but by all kinds of malicious tools that can manipulate, steal or delete their data.   ''There is going to be a lot more of these attacks,'' he said. ''We'll see copycats, and not just for ransomware, but other attacks.''     "
Addiction to Pirated Software Leaves China Vulnerable to Malware Assaults,"Follow Paul Mozur on Twitter @paulmozur . HONG KONG -- China is home to the world's largest group of internet users, a thriving online technology scene and rampant software piracy that encapsulates its determination to play by its own set of digital rules. But as the country scrambles to recover from a global hacking assault that hit its companies, government agencies and universities especially hard, the risks of its dependence on pirated software are becoming clear.    Researchers believe large numbers of computers running unlicensed versions of Windows probably contributed to the reach of the so-called ransomware attack, according to the Finnish cybersecurity company F-Secure. Because pirated software usually is not registered with the developer, users often miss major security patches that could ward off assaults.    It is not clear whether every company or institution in China affected by the ransomware, which locked users out of their computers and demanded payment to allow them to return, was using pirated software. But universities, local governments and state-run companies probably have networks that depend on unlicensed copies of Windows.   Microsoft and other Western companies have complained for years about widespread use of pirated software in a number of countries that were hit particularly hard by the attack. A study last year by BSA, a trade association of software vendors, found that 70 percent of software installed on computers in China was not properly licensed in 2015. Russia, at 64 percent, and India, 58 percent, were close behind.   Zhu Huanjie, who is studying network engineering in Hangzhou, China, blamed a number of ills for the spread of the attack, including the lack of security on school networks. He said piracy was also a factor. Many users, he said, did not update their software to get the latest safety features because of a fear that their copies would be damaged or locked, while universities offered only older, pirated versions.   ''Most of the schools are now all using pirate software, including operation system and professional software,'' he said. ''In China, the Windows that most people are using is still pirated. This is just the way it is.''   On Monday, some Chinese institutions were still cleaning computer systems jammed by the attack. Prestigious research institutions like Tsinghua University were affected, as were major companies like China Telecom and Hainan Airlines.   China's securities regulator said it had taken down its network to try to protect it, and the country's banking regulator warned lenders to be cautious when dealing with the malicious software.   Police stations and local security offices reported problems on social media, while university students reported being locked out of final thesis papers. Electronic payment systems at gas stations run by the state oil giant PetroChina were cut off for much of the weekend. Over all, according to the official state television broadcaster, about 40,000 institutions were hit. Separately, the Chinese security company Qihoo 360 reported that computers at more than 29,000 organizations had been infected.   At China Telecom, one of the country's three main state-run telecommunications providers, a similar scramble occurred over the weekend, according to an employee who was not authorized to speak on the matter. When a company-provided software patch did not work, the employee was told to use one from Qihoo 360, which supports pirated and out-of-date versions of Windows, the person said. A spokesman for China Telecom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   On Monday, the main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, quoted an unnamed person in charge of internet security saying that the ransomware was still spreading but the speed of transmission had slowed. It said that regulators overseeing banks, schools, the police and other groups had given orders to stop the risk and that it had instructed users on how to avoid exposure.   Using copied software and other media has become embedded in China's computing culture, said Thomas Parenty, founder of Archefact Group, which advises companies on cybersecurity. Some people are under the impression that using pirated goods in China is legal, while others are simply not used to paying for software, he said.   Mr. Parenty cited an instance when he was working at the Beijing office of an American client. ''It turned out every single one of their computers, all the software, was bootlegged,'' he said.   The twin problems of malware and the unwillingness to pay for software are so ingrained that they have led to an alternative type of security company in China. Qihoo 360 built its business by offering free security programs; it makes money from advertising.   The issue has led to political battles between Microsoft and the Chinese government.   In a bid to get more organizations in China to pay for their software, Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., has tried education and outreach. It has also stopped distributing Windows on discs, which are easy to copy.   One effort in 2014 put it at loggerheads with Beijing.   At that time, Microsoft cut off support for Windows XP, an operating system that was about 14 years old but that was still widely used by the government and by Chinese companies. Many in China complained that the move showed that the country still relied on decisions made by foreign companies. An article by the official news agency Xinhua said that such corporate behavior could be considered anticompetitive. Microsoft later agreed to offer free upgrades and reached a deal with a state-run company that often works for the military to develop a version that catered to China.   The Chinese government has been less focused on software piracy -- and more on building local alternatives to Microsoft. After leaks by the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden about American hacking attacks aimed at monitoring China's military buildup, leaders in Beijing accelerated a push to develop Chinese-branded software and hardware that would be harder to breach.   For now, however, much of China relies on Windows. And for all of the impact of the weekend's cyberattack, Mr. Parenty said he did not think that there would be a big effect on attitudes toward pirated software.   ''The only way I see this changing things is if the central government decides there is a risk to critical infrastructure from this threat and force people to buy legitimate software,'' he said. ''But I don't see that happening right now.''     "
Backing Up Your Backup Drive,"Q. I keep my photos, videos and other multimedia files stored on an external USB drive to save space on my computer's main hard drive, and I also back up vital folders there. But how do I back up the external drive in case it goes south?  A. You can create multiple backups of your important data in several ways, including on multiple external drives, to a home network server or to an online cloud-storage locker. In these days of ransomware and other data-corrupting attacks, having a backup drive that is not always connected to your computer (and therefore not vulnerable to online attack or spreading malware) can be another way to protect your files.    A one-terabyte external USB drive can cost $75 or less online, so alternating drives on a regular basis is one way to safely copy your files each day while keeping one drive unconnected. Backup programs like Acronis Backup & Recovery 10 can be configured to back up the computer to multiple USB drives at once if you are confident in your security software and do not want to manually swap external drives each day.   Large-capacity hardware like network-attached storage devices or other storage solutions (like those made by Drobo, Seagate or Western Digital) are other options to back up your external drive's contents. The Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times, recommends the $250 QNAP Turbo NAS as the best network-attached storage server for home users.   Backing up your external drive to an online server creates an additional copy of your data -- and one that is not in the same physical location as your computer and external drive. Backblaze is among the online services that can back up external USB drives, although it does not do Apple's Time Machine drives and network-attached storage servers; prices start at $5 a month. The Wirecutter picks CrashPlan as its top online backup solution, and the company's $60-a-year service can also back up external USB drives. Both Backblaze and CrashPlan offer free trial periods so you can try out the service before committing.

Ransomware Gives Rise To Doubly Harmful Ponzi,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The first message to pop up on the computer screen let the victims know they had been hacked. The second message gave them a way out. The victim had a choice: Pay the hackers a ransom of one bitcoin, a digital currency worth roughly $2,365, in exchange for regaining access to the computer, or try to infect two new people on behalf of the attackers. If someone the victim knew fell for the bait and became infected, the attackers would consider the ransom paid and cede control of the infected computer.    The attack late last year was, according to the cybersecurity researchers who discovered what they now call the Popcorn Time ransomware, the first Ponzi scheme for one of the internet's oldest types of cyberattacks.    Ransomware, a type of malicious software that infects a system and then holds it hostage, demanding a ransom for its release, is one of the most popular and lucrative ways to attack computers.   Security companies estimate that criminals raked in roughly $1 billion from ransomware attacks in 2016. This year, the number is likely to be much higher, as ransomware schemes multiply. One strain, WannaCry, made global headlines last month by infecting hundreds of thousands of computers in 74 countries in about a day.   The scheme has become more successful as more of what we do goes online, from business client lists to family photos. With the click of a button, an entire system can be infected. With another click, criminals can wipe information from a computer or expose it to the public. It all depends on what commands a bigger ransom: losing information or exposing it.   Security researchers warn that WannaCry, which exploited a wide-ranging vulnerability in Windows systems and then used a clever mechanism to to spread itself across new systems, is just the tip of the iceberg. They are tracking new schemes dreamed up by criminals who have quickly realized that people are willing to pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in ransom.   ''This is a growing business because it works,'' said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, a security firm based in Helsinki, Finland. ''And the attacks are becoming more creative and effective.''   Mr. Hypponen, whose team found and first reported on the Popcorn malware, said it was an outlier in the world of ransomware. It was the first attempt to combine a Ponzi, or pyramid scheme, in which one person entraps another, with malware that holds a computer hostage for payment. If it proved successful, he added, a number of criminal networks were likely to copy the model. Researchers are still monitoring the scheme to see if it works.   ''These networks all watch each other and learn. When a new model works, it quickly grows as others build on it,'' Mr. Hypponen said.   Asaf Cidon, a vice president at the security company Barracuda Networks who studies ransomware, said that criminals had become more sophisticated in the last year, especially in how they choose their victims.   ''Attackers will go after a specific department at a company, for instance human resources, where they know emails and links are more likely to get opened,'' Mr. Cidon said. Networks will choose a company to target and then comb LinkedIn to draw a map of people employed by that company, he said.   They might then use that map to impersonate various people or leverage their way into the company's social network, ultimately using whatever means necessary to make sure that the system becomes infected with the ransomware.   ''We've seen them impersonate people within the company, or impersonate airlines sending ticketing information or vendors and customers of the company sending files,'' Mr. Cidon said, adding that all businesses, from mom-and-pop shops to giant Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google, were getting hit by ransomware attacks.   Other notable ransomware schemes discovered recently included a plot to infect internet-connected home devices, such as the LG Smart TV, by displaying a fake F.B.I. warning screen on the television and demanding $500 to unlock the it.   Late last year, researchers carried out a proof-of-concept demonstration showing how internet-connected home thermostats, such as Nest, could be hacked and held hostage, leaving homeowners in the freezing cold (or blistering heat).   ''There is a lot of money at stake here, so criminals are always going to be interested,'' said Mr. Hypponen, whose company is still tracking the fallout from last month's WannaCry virus.   Though the speed and effectiveness through which that particular attack spread caused it to make headlines, Mr. Hypponen said it was, in ransomware terms, unsuccessful.   ''WannaCry was a failure because it became too public, too visible and it made almost no money,'' said Hypponen, citing the most recent figures that the ransomware netted just under $100,000 for the attackers, who have not yet been caught. WannaCry, he explained, was a victim of its own success. The more public it became, the more unlikely it was that a potential victim would pay out the ransom.   He also said it was an innovative idea, as the attackers combined ransomware with malware that acted like an old internet scourge known as a ''worm,'' essentially spreading itself across systems as it infected them.   While the first worm was created in 1988 by a Cornell graduate student named Robert Morris, who appeared to be more motivated by curiosity than malice, computer worms quickly became one of the most popular and destructive forms of cyberattacks.   ''This was a good idea, to combine the two processes together,'' Mr. Hypponen said. ''Other groups are watching this, and we are going to see other versions of this, better versions, soon.''     "
Aftershock Feared as U.S. Warns Of Malware Attack's Complexity,"The components of the global cyberattack that seized hundreds of thousands of computer systems last week may be more complex than originally believed, a Trump administration official said Sunday, and experts warned that the effects of the malicious software could linger for some time. As a new workweek started Monday in Asia, there were concerns the malicious software could spread further and in different forms, with new types of ransomware afflicting computers around the globe.    There were initial reports of new cases found over the weekend in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.   President Trump has ordered his homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, who has a background in cyberissues, to coordinate the government's response to the spread of the malware and help organize the search for who was responsible, an administration official said Sunday.    The attack is more complicated because ''the experts tell us that this code was cobbled together from many places and sources,'' according to an administration official who insisted on anonymity to discuss the government's cybersecurity plans. The more potential sources of the malicious code, the harder it is for investigators to run down the trail of possible perpetrators.   The source of the attack is a delicate issue for the United States because the vulnerability on which the malicious software is based was published by a group called the Shadow Brokers, which last summer began publishing cybertools developed by the National Security Agency.   Government investigators, while not publicly acknowledging that the computer code was developed by American intelligence agencies as part of the country's growing arsenal of cyberweapons, say they are still investigating how the code got out. There are many theories, but increasingly it looks as though the initial breach came from an insider, perhaps a government contractor.   Copycat variants of the malicious software behind the attacks have begun to proliferate, according to experts who were on guard for new attacks. ''We are in the second wave,'' said Matthieu Suiche of Comae Technologies, a cybersecurity company based in the United Arab Emirates. ''As expected, the attackers have released new variants of the malware. We can surely expect more.''   The National Police Agency in Japan found two computers with the malicious software over the weekend, according to reports by NHK, the national broadcaster. One instance was found on a personal computer in a hospital and the other on a private citizen's home computer. A hospital in Taiwan also reported that one of its computers was compromised, Taiwan's Central News Agency said Sunday.   Five businesses in South Korea reported ransomware attacks over the weekend, according to the government's internet security agency, and a Korean theater chain said late-night moviegoers on Sunday alerted them when computer ransom notes appeared on screens instead of programmed advertisements.   The spread of the malicious software, or malware, has focused attention on several questions, including why a software patch, issued by Microsoft in March, was not installed by more users. But for many systems, especially older systems, such patches are not installed automatically -- a fact the hackers took advantage of. Microsoft has not said how it became aware of the vulnerability, but it seems likely it was tipped off by the National Security Agency.   Brad Smith, the president and chief legal officer of Microsoft, said in a blog post Sunday that the attack should be a ''wake-up call'' for the tech industry, consumers and governments.   Mr. Smith said that Microsoft had the ''first responsibility'' for addressing vulnerabilities in its software, and that customers must be vigilant. But he said the latest attack showed the dangers of governments' ''stockpiling of vulnerabilities.''   ''Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage,'' Mr. Smith wrote.   So far, the main targets of the attack have been outside the United States. But neither the federal government nor American corporations assume that this will continue to be the case.   Britain's National Cyber Security Center said Sunday that it had seen ''no sustained new attacks'' but warned that compromised computers might not have been detected yet and that the malware could further spread within networks.   Monday could bring a wave of attacks to the United States, warned Caleb Barlow, the vice president of threat intelligence for IBM. ''How the infections spread across Asia, then Europe overnight will be telling for businesses here in the United States,'' he said.   The cyberattack has hit 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries, according to Rob Wainwright, the executive director of Europol, Europe's police agency.   Among the organizations hit were FedEx in the United States, the Spanish telecom giant Telefónica, the French automaker Renault, universities in China, Germany's federal railway system and Russia's Interior Ministry. The most disruptive attacks infected Britain's public health system, where surgeries had to be rescheduled and some patients were turned away from emergency rooms.   A 22-year-old British researcher who uses the Twitter name MalwareTech has been credited with inadvertently helping to stanch the spread of the assault by identifying the web domain for the hackers' ''kill switch'' -- a way of disabling the malware. Mr. Suiche of Comae Technologies said he had done the same for one of the new variants of malware to surface since the initial wave.   On Sunday, MalwareTech was one of many security experts warning that a less-vulnerable version of the malware is likely to be released. On Twitter, he urged users to immediately install a  security patch for older versions of Microsoft's Windows, including Windows XP. (The attack did not target Windows 10.)   Version 1 of WannaCrypt was stoppable but version 2.0 will likely remove the flaw. You're only safe if you patch ASAP. -- MalwareTech (@MalwareTechBlog) May 14, 2017   Robert Pritchard, a former cybersecurity expert at Britain's defense ministry, said that security specialists might not be able to keep pace with the hackers.   ''This vulnerability still exits; other people are bound to exploit it,'' he said. ''The current variant will make its way into antivirus software. But what about any new variants that will come in the future?''   Allan Liska, an analyst with Recorded Future, a cybersecurity company, said a new version of the ransomware he examined Sunday did not have the kill switch. ''This is probably version 2.1, and it has the potential to be much more effective -- assuming security defenders haven't spent all weekend patching,'' he said.   The Microsoft patch will help, but installing it across large organizations will take time.   Microsoft has complained for years that a large majority of computers running its software are using pirated versions. The spread of hacking attacks has made legal versions of software more popular, as they typically provide automatic updates of security upgrades.   Governments around the world were bracing themselves for new attacks.   ''Please beware and anticipate, and take preventive steps against the WannaCry malware attack,'' Indonesia's communication and information minister, Rudiantara, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, said Sunday at a news conference.   He confirmed that one hospital -- Dharmais Hospital in the capital, Jakarta, which specializes in cancer treatment -- had been afflicted by the malware, but without major effects on patients.   In Britain, fallout continued Sunday. Two opposition parties, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, asserted that the governing Conservative Party had not done enough to prevent the attack. With a general election June 8, officials have been racing to get ahead of the problem.   Britain's defense minister, Michael Fallon, told the BBC on Sunday that the government was spending about 50 million pounds, about $64 million, to improve cybersecurity at the National Health Service, where many computers still run the outdated Windows XP software, which Microsoft had stopped supporting.   A government regulator warned the N.H.S. in July that updating hardware and software was ''a matter of urgency,'' and noted that one hospital had already had to pay £700,000, about $900,000, to repair a breach that began after an employee clicked on a web link in an unsafe email.

That Old Phone Trump Uses for Twitter Could Be an Opening to Security Threats,"President Trump has carried his Twitter habit into his presidency. He has also brought with him another tech habit that is causing concern. Mr. Trump has been using his old, unsecured Android phone to post on Twitter since moving to Washington late last week.  The president's desire to use his old, personal smartphone raises concerns that its use could be exposing him and the nation to security threats. He is using the Android smartphone mainly to post on Twitter, not to make calls. But it's unclear what security measures have been put in place on the device and how vulnerable he could be to someone stealing data or breaking into his Twitter account. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter requires a connection to the internet, which exposes the device to security vulnerabilities if proper measures like two-factor authentication - a password and a code texted to a phone, for example - are not in place. If he uses the smartphone on an unsecure Wi-Fi network, he could be exposing his location and other personal information on the device. ""The absolutely minimum Trump could do to protect our nation is to use a secure device to protect him from foreign spies and other threats,"" said Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon on the Intelligence Committee. ""It would be irresponsible in the extreme for the commander in chief to use an unsecure device that could be easily hacked or intercepted."" Among the concerns by security experts: "" It is unclear if the device and its functions like texting are encrypted to thwart hacking. "" The device could be more vulnerable to hacking if used on unsecured Wi-Fi and cellular networks, such as when Mr. Trump travels between meetings or anywhere outside the White House. "" Hackers could access the device to turn on the camera and microphone. "" Stingray devices, a type of surveillance tool often used by law enforcement, can track a device's location and other information. ""There are a lot of questions, but it is clear there are often vulnerabilities in our phones and internet systems - and it is critical that people take precautions to ensure their sensitive information is protected from hackers and other malicious actors,"" said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. The president's use of the personal device is particularly notable given his criticism of Hillary Clinton for using a personal email address and server when she was secretary of state. In 2009, President Barack Obama fought to become the first president with a smartphone; though he won, the use of a White House-issued secure device came with many rules. ""As president, he is the biggest sitting target in the world,"" said Kevin Bankston, the director of New America's Open Technology Institute.

When Cyberweapons Go Missing,"Twice in the past few months, powerful cyberattacks have wreaked havoc on the world, shutting down tens of thousands of computers, including critical machines in hospitals, a nuclear site and businesses. The attacks were initially thought to be schemes to collect ransom, but their goals -- whether money, politics or just chaos -- have become increasingly blurred. One thing seems clear: The weapons for the attack were developed by the National Security Agency and stolen from it.  That's chilling. After the first attack, Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said the theft of the cyberweapons was equivalent to Tomahawk missiles' being stolen from the military, and he issued a scathing critique of the government's stockpiling of computer vulnerabilities. The N.S.A. has not only failed to assist in identifying the vulnerabilities its weapons were designed to exploit but has also not even acknowledged their existence or their theft.    It remains a mystery whether the N.S.A. knows how its weapons were stolen. What is known is that a group called Shadow Brokers started offering them for sale in August and made them public in April. It promised a fresh batch last month, offering them to monthly subscribers. Former intelligence officials said it was clear the weapons came from an N.S.A. unit formerly known as Tailored Access Operations.   Once publicly available, the weapons can be reconfigured for many purposes and used by anyone with some computer savvy. North Korea was thought to be a culprit in the first wave of attacks, and Russian hackers may have been behind the second. Other forces may be at work, too. A cybersecurity officer with the IDT Corporation in Newark, Golan Ben-Oni, has made waves with warnings that ransom demands could be a cover for far deeper invasions to steal confidential information.   Secrecy, of course, is the N.S.A.'s stock in trade, and acknowledging authorship of stolen cyberweapons runs counter to everything the spy agency does. A spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House was quoted as saying that the administration ''is committed to responsibly balancing national security interests and public safety and security.''   Fixing this deadly serious problem is certain to be complex, but the task is urgent. The N.S.A. clearly needs to do a better job of safeguarding the cyberweapons it is developing and also neutralizing the damage their theft has unleashed. Microsoft, whose software vulnerabilities were exploited in the attacks, and companies that use its software will have to strengthen their defenses.   Beyond that, the federal government may want to offer grants as incentives to groups doing malware analysis. Once conclusively identified, the culprits behind the attacks must be penalized in some way, such as with sanctions. While the immediate focus needs to be on concrete responses, it is also worth thinking seriously about more global cooperation, such as the Digital Geneva Convention proposed by Microsoft as a way to prevent cyberwarfare.   The horrible new form of warfare for which the N.S.A. has been developing arms has actually begun.     "
Why the World Is Getting Hacked,"Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, is the author of the forthcoming ''Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest'' and a contributing opinion writer. The path to a global outbreak on Friday of a ransom-demanding computer software (''ransomware'') that crippled hospitals in Britain -- forcing the rerouting of ambulances, delays in surgeries and the shutdown of diagnostic equipment -- started, as it often does, with a defect in software, a bug. This is perhaps the first salvo of a global crisis that has been brewing for decades. Fixing this is possible, but it will be expensive and require a complete overhaul of how technology companies, governments and institutions operate and handle software. The alternative should be unthinkable. Just this March, Microsoft released a patch to fix vulnerabilities in its operating systems, which run on about 80 percent of desktop computers globally. Shortly after that, a group called ''Shadow Brokers'' released hacking tools that took advantage of vulnerabilities that had already been fixed in these patches.     It seemed that Shadow Brokers had acquired tools the National Security Agency had used to break into computers. Realizing these tools were stolen, the N.S.A. had warned affected companies like Microsoft and Cisco so they could fix the vulnerabilities. Users were protected if they had applied the patches that were released, but with a catch: If an institution still used an older Microsoft operating system, it did not receive this patch unless it paid for an expensive ''custom'' support agreement.   The cash-strapped National Health Service in Britain, which provides health care to more than 50 million people, and whose hospitals still use Windows XP widely, was not among those that signed up to purchase the custom support from Microsoft.   They were out in the cold.   On May 12, a massive ''ransomware'' attack using one of those vulnerabilities hit hospitals in Britain, telecommunication companies in Spain, FedEx in the United States, the Russian Interior Ministry and many other institutions around the world. They had either not applied these patches to systems where it was available for free, or had not paid the extra money for older ones.   Computer after computer froze, their files inaccessible, with an ominous onscreen message asking for about $300 worth of ''bitcoin'' -- a cryptocurrency that allows for hard-to-trace transfers of money. Ambulances headed for children's hospitals were diverted. Doctors were unable to check on patients' allergies or see what drugs they were taking. Labs, X-rays and diagnostic machinery and information became inaccessible. Surgeries were postponed. There was economic damage, too. Renault, the European automaker, had to halt production.   The attack was halted by a stroke of luck: the ransomware had a kill switch that a British employee in a cybersecurity firm managed to activate. Shortly after, Microsoft finally released for free the patch that they had been withholding from users that had not signed up for expensive custom support agreements.   But the crisis is far from over. This particular vulnerability still lives in unpatched systems, and the next one may not have a convenient kill switch.   While it is inevitable that software will have bugs, there are ways to make operating systems much more secure -- but that costs real money. While this particular bug affected both new and old versions of Microsoft's operating systems, the older ones like XP have more critical vulnerabilities. This is partly because our understanding of how to make secure software has advanced over the years, and partly because of the incentives in the software business. Since most software is sold with an ''as is'' license, meaning the company is not legally liable for any issues with it even on day one, it has not made much sense to spend the extra money and time required to make software more secure quickly. Indeed, for many years, Facebook's mantra for its programmers was ''move fast and break things.''   This isn't all Microsoft's fault though. Its newer operating systems, like Windows 10, are much more secure. There are many more players and dimensions to this ticking bomb.   During this latest ransomware crisis, it became clear there were many institutions that could have patched or upgraded their systems, but they had not. This isn't just because their information technology departments are incompetent (though there are surely cases of that, too). Upgrades come with many downsides that make people reluctant to install them.   For example, the more secure Windows 10 comes with so many privacy concerns that the Electronic Frontier Foundation issued numerous alerts about it, and the European Union is still investigating it. My current Windows 10 machine is more secure but it advertises to me in the login screen. (Are they also profiling me to target advertisements? A fair question in this environment.)   Further, upgrades almost always bring unwanted features. When I was finally forced to upgrade my Outlook mail program, it took me months to get used to the new color scheme and spacing somebody in Seattle had decided was the new look. There was no option to keep things as is. Users hate this, and often are rightfully reluctant to upgrade. But they are often unaware that these unwanted features come bundled with a security update.   As an added complication, the ways companies communicate about upgrades and unilaterally change the user interface make people vulnerable to phishing, since one is never sure what is a real login or upgrade message and what is a bogus one, linking to a fake website trying to steal a login.   The problem is even worse for institutions like hospitals which run a lot of software provided by a variety of different vendors, often embedded in expensive medical equipment. For them, upgrading the operating system (a cost itself) may also mean purchasing millions of dollars worth of new software. Much of this software also comes with problems, and the ''no liability'' policy means that vendors can just sell the product, take the money and run. Sometimes, medical equipment is certified as it is, and an upgrade brings along re-certification questions. The machines can (as they should) last for decades; that the software should just expire and junk everything every 10 years is not a workable solution. Upgrades can also introduce new bugs. How do you test new software when the upgrade can potentially freeze your M.R.I.? Last year, a software update ''bricked'' Tesla cars: they could not be driven anymore until another update fixed the problem. Many large institutions are thus wary of upgrades.   The next crisis facing us is the so-called ''internet of things'': devices like baby monitors, refrigerators and lighting now come with networked software. Many such devices are terribly insecure and, worse, don't even have a mechanism for receiving updates. In the current regulatory environment, the people who write the insecure software and the companies who sold the ''things'' bear no liability.   If I have painted a bleak picture, it is because things are bleak. Our software evolves by layering new systems on old, and that means we have constructed entire cities upon crumbling swamps. And we live on the fault lines where more earthquakes are inevitable. All the key actors have to work together, and fast.   First, companies like Microsoft should discard the idea that they can abandon people using older software. The money they made from these customers hasn't expired; neither has their responsibility to fix defects. Besides, Microsoft is sitting on a cash hoard estimated at more than $100 billion (the result of how little tax modern corporations pay and how profitable it is to sell a dominant operating system under monopolistic dynamics with no liability for defects).   At a minimum, Microsoft clearly should have provided the critical update in March to all its users, not just those paying extra. Indeed, ''pay extra money to us or we will withhold critical security updates'' can be seen as its own form of ransomware. In its defense, Microsoft probably could point out that its operating systems have come a long way in security since Windows XP, and it has spent a lot of money updating old software, even above industry norms. However, industry norms are lousy to horrible, and it is reasonable to expect a company with a dominant market position, that made so much money selling software that runs critical infrastructure, to do more.   Microsoft should spend more of that $100 billion to help institutions and users upgrade to newer software, especially those who run essential services on it. This has to be through a system that incentivizes institutions and people to upgrade to more secure systems and does not force choosing between privacy and security. Security updates should only update security, and everything else should be optional and unbundled.   The United States government has resources and institutions to help fix this. N.S.A.'s charter gives it a dual role: both offensive and defensive. That the agency discloses software vulnerabilities it finds to companies more quickly may be a good idea, but doing so doesn't solve this problem, since finding bugs is not limited to the N.S.A. -- criminals and other nations can keep finding them. Nor are bugs in limited supply, so we cannot get to the bottom of the problem by fixing them one by one. There are, however, many technical measures that can be taken to build operating systems that are structurally less vulnerable to bugs. In other words, we can't eliminate bugs, but with careful design, we can make it so that they cannot easily wreak havoc like this. For example, Chromebooks and Apple's iOS are structurally much more secure because they were designed from the ground up with security in mind, unlike Microsoft's operating systems.   It is past time that the N.S.A. shifted to a defensive posture and the United States government focused on protecting its citizens and companies from malware, hacking and ransomware -- rather than focusing so much on spying. This isn't just about disclosing vulnerabilities, a hot-button topic that often distracts from deeper issues. It also means helping develop standards for higher security -- something an agency devoted to finding weaknesses is very well suited to do -- as well as identifying systemic cybersecurity risks and then helping fix them, rather than using them offensively, to spy on others.   There is also the thorny problem of finding money and resources to upgrade critical infrastructure without crippling it. Many institutions see information technology as an afterthought and are slow in upgrading and investing. Governments also do not prioritize software security. This is a sure road to disaster.   As a reminder of what is at stake, ambulances carrying sick children were diverted and heart patients turned away from surgery in Britain by the ransomware attack. Those hospitals may never get their data back. The last big worm like this, Conficker, infected millions of computers in almost 200 countries in 2008. We are much more dependent on software for critical functions today, and there is no guarantee there will be a kill switch next time.   It is time to consider whether the current regulatory setup, which allows all software vendors to externalize the costs of all defects and problems to their customers with zero liability, needs re-examination. It is also past time for the very profitable software industry, the institutions that depend on their products and the government agencies entrusted with keeping their citizens secure and their infrastructure functioning, step up and act decisively.

Pyongyang's Cyberpower,"The chilling survey of North Korea's cyberpower in The Times, describing a sophisticated program of not only weapons of war but also of theft, blackmail, harassment and score-settling, is shocking, but not surprising. Kim Jong-un is ruthless in his quest for power and survival, and hacking, even more than the nuclear power North Korea is rapidly developing, is the perfect weapon for a small, impoverished, isolated, totalitarian state.  Pyongyang's nuclear weapons pose an enormous threat to the United States and its Asian allies. But even a megalomaniac like Mr. Kim understands that unleashing them would spell a hellish end to him and his country. Cyberweapons, by contrast, offer a degree of stealth and deniability and a broad range of uses, as David Sanger, David Kirkpatrick and Nicole Perlroth detailed in their article. North Korea has used its army of hackers for assaults as diverse as multimillion-dollar digital bank robberies, the giant WannaCry ransomware attack (based on a secret tool stolen from the National Security Agency) and attacks on movie producers and television networks to force them to cancel projects deemed hostile by North Korea.    Mr. Kim's total control over his country gives him his pick of the best young brains to train as hackers; the cost is relatively low, and effective retaliation has so far proved very difficult. North Korea is already under every possible international sanction, its infrastructure is too primitive for useful cyberretaliation, and neither the United States nor South Korea would likely launch a military attack. And North Korean hackers appear to operate largely outside the country, especially in China and India.   North Korea is no pioneer in cyberpower and is hardly the first to use it. Russia has deployed it, allegedly to attack Estonia and Ukraine and to meddle in American politics; China is a major and persistent cyberspy, as is the United States, whose cyberefforts have sabotaged North Korean missile tests. Electronic warfare, surveillance, espionage, sabotage, theft and other trickery are, alas, a real and growing danger that demands ever more sophisticated defenses.   But North Korea represents a different sort of threat, more akin to terrorist networks, which are less susceptible to counterattacks and sanctions that might deter a conventional government. With China, the United States reached a cybersecurity agreement in 2015 that was a first step toward resolving American frustration with Chinese snooping.   No such agreement is likely soon with North Korea. Its hackers, however, are not beyond reach: Many are dispersed abroad, where they can be tracked and shut down.   The self-interest that prompted China to seek an agreement with the United States over cyberactivity should motivate countries where the North Koreans operate -- starting with India and China -- to cooperate with the Americans in combating this threat. And governments tempted to close their eyes to Pyongyang's mischief should be reminded that they'd risk being treated as accomplices in economic crimes and as dangerous threats.

Times Tech Experts Share Digital Security Tips,"How do New York Times staff members use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Bill McKinley, executive director of information security, and Runa Sandvik, director of information security, discuss the technology they are using. What are your biggest concerns about security of The Times's newsroom these days?    This is a difficult challenge for us. The landscape is ever-changing and the threats we see today will likely evolve into something more difficult to defend against tomorrow. Our mission is to help the newsroom protect its communications, data and sources.    Last year, we helped set up The Times's Tips page, which includes SecureDrop, outlined ways to safely work with the information we receive and built a security awareness program that is unique to the newsroom. We provide tools, training and focus on helping the journalists address the challenges that they are facing.   However, tools and processes will only get us so far. The biggest concern will always be that a source is burned or that a journalist's life is in danger.   How do you vet tech products to protect journalists and editors from cyberthreats?   The products that we recommend to the newsroom are the products we use ourselves, such as Signal for secure mobile communications. Before we use or recommend a product, we make sure we understand how it works, its limitations and how it protects our users. Is it easy to use? Has the product been reviewed by other security researchers? How many people are using it? We look at all these issues.   What's one tool or product that you have found to be effective in protecting the newsroom, and why does it work?   Journalists often need to click on links and attachments from people they don't know, and it's our job to help them do so securely. One product that is effective in protecting against phishing of online accounts is the Security Key, which is a physical device that connects to your computer just like a thumb drive. The key is supported by both Google and Facebook.   The Security Key can be used as an alternative to SMS or an authenticator app for two-factor authentication, which is a way to secure your accounts by requiring not just your user name or password, but something you have. The key uses cryptography instead of randomly generated codes and works only with the sites that it's set up to work with -- not lookalike sites that might've been developed with malicious intent.   What is your biggest tip for people for protecting their online security and privacy?   The best things you can do are to use a password manager, set up two-factor authentication on the sites that offer it and keep all software up to date. Doing so helps secure access to your online accounts and limits your exposure to phishing and malware.   A password manager, such as 1Password, LastPass or Dashlane, helps you create unique, strong passwords for all your websites and securely stores the passwords for you -- no more passwords in emails, notebooks or on Post-it notes. To ensure that your accounts remain secure even if the password manager is compromised, set up two-factor authentication where available and configure your devices not to remember your passwords.   Two-factor authentication helps you protect your accounts by adding a second step to the login process. In addition to your username and password, you also present a second factor such as a Security Key or a random code from your mobile phone. Logging in will then require a combination of something you know and something you have, so no one can get into your accounts without both things.   Software updates contain more than just new features, emojis and dog filters; they can also contain fixes for security issues that researchers have discovered. Keeping all software up to date and rebooting when necessary is one of the easiest things you can do to ensure your devices are as secure as possible.   Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?   Bill: That's easy: automation tools. But not automation for the sake of automation. Automation that serves a purpose. At home, the house is fully wired with Wi-Fi switches and outlets are everywhere in our house, resulting in things like randomizing on/off of lights when no one is home. We also have integrated smoke detectors, thermostats, our security system and others.   On Android, I use the Tasker app religiously to stop texts coming in when I'm driving, set volume levels at work and launch apps based on conditions.   My favorite automation tool for mobile is IFTTT, a service that lets you automate tasks beteen other web services, such as Gmail, Facebook and Instagram.   Runa: I love products that provide security by default, such as the Chromebook laptop and the iPhone. Being secure by default allows me to focus on the other things I have going on in my life without being concerned about the devices themselves.   What is on your tech wish list -- either a gadget or app -- to get or try next and why?   Bill: Photography is a hobby of mine and I've used D.S.L.R. cameras for years. It helps bridge my two loves: tech and nature. I frequently take my camera out for daylong hikes and shoot. Lately, I've had my eye on a Canon 5D Mark IV. Or, possibly a move toward mirrorless technology like the Fuji X-T2, although I've yet to do my own side-by-side comparison.   Runa: I have everything I need. I could perhaps use a tablet or a watch or a new monitor, but the truth is that I want to be less connected, not more. I tend to prefer books and movies to new gadgets and apps.

More Evidence Points to North Korean Role in Global Ransomware Attack,"SAN FRANCISCO -- More evidence emerged Monday that North Korean hackers were behind the global ransomware attack that still holds hundreds of thousands of computers hostage. There are now hard links connecting a group of North Korean hackers that experts call the Lazarus Group to the ransomware known as WannaCry, according to researchers at the security company Symantec.    Symantec's researchers first pointed the finger at Lazarus last week, but on Monday said their findings were close to conclusive.    ''From all that we see, the technical evidence points to the fact that this is Lazarus,'' Eric Chien, an investigator at Symantec, said in an interview Monday.   Mr. Chien and his colleagues found the first known case of a WannaCry ransomware attack on a computer in February.   Within two minutes of infecting that machine, the attackers infected more than 100 computers on their victims' computer network.   But the hackers left behind a trail of digital crumbs that Mr. Chien and his colleagues had traced to previous attacks by the Lazarus Group, which United States government officials have said works at the behest of Pyongyang.   The most conclusive evidence researchers have found is in what researchers say is the attackers' ''command-and-control'' infrastructure.   The WannaCry attacks used the same command-and-control server used in the North Korean hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, which wiped out nearly half of the company's personal computers and servers.   Researchers also say the same tools used in previous Lazarus attacks on banks and media companies in South Korea in 2013 were used in the WannaCry ransomware episode.   Those tools have evolved, but are what researchers call ''variants'' of the same tools used in the other attacks.   Researchers also said they saw heavy crossover between the computer code in the earlier attacks and WannaCry. That crossover provided what Mr. Chien said was yet another ''hard link.''   Other digital crumbs linking the North Korean group to WannaCry include a tool that deletes data that had been used in other Lazarus attacks. The hackers behind WannaCry also used a rare encryption method and an equally unusual technique to cover their tracks.   ''We don't see that used anywhere else,'' Mr. Chien said.   In the February WannaCry attacks, Symantec's researchers said the hackers spread from server to server the same way the Lazarus hackers had in their previous attacks.   In May, another group of hackers that call themselves the Shadow Brokers published the details of National Security Agency hacking tools that the WannaCry hackers were able to use to add muscle to their attacks. They used a leaked N.S.A. hacking tool to automatically spread from server to server, eventually infecting hundreds of thousands of machines around the world, most notably in Europe and Asia.   Some computer security experts have said it is too soon to accuse North Korea, and North Korean officials have denied involvement.   Before the latest evidence came out Monday, James Scott, a senior fellow at the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, called the early attribution ''shoddy'' in an online post, and said the ''attribution to North Korea is premature and likely false.''   Some also pointed to the small sums the attack was generating as proof that the attacks were the haphazard work of unsuccessful cybercriminals, rather than government-backed hackers.   By Monday, only 223 victims of more than 200,000 had paid ransoms, generating $109,270 to the attackers' Bitcoin wallets, according to Dell SecureWorks. The attackers were forced to issue a reminder on victims' computer screens to pay up.   But despite the financial letdown, the researchers say they are confident the technical evidence points to the Lazarus group.     "
Focus Turns to North Korea Sleeper Cells as Possible Culprits,"SEOUL, South Korea -- They take legitimate jobs as software programmers in the neighbors of their home country, North Korea. When the instructions from Pyongyang come for a hacking assault, they are believed to split into groups of three or six, moving around to avoid detection. Ever since the 1980s, reclusive North Korea has been known to train cadres of digital soldiers to engage in electronic warfare and profiteering exploits against its perceived enemies, most notably South Korea and the United States. In more recent years, cybersecurity experts say, the North Koreans have spread these agents across the border into China and other Asian countries to help cloak their identities. The strategy also amounts to war-contingency planning in case the homeland is attacked.     Now this force of North Korean cyberhacking sleeper cells is under new scrutiny in connection with the ransomware assaults that have roiled much of the world over the past four days. New signs have emerged not only that North Koreans carried out the attacks but also that the targeted victims included China, North Korea's benefactor and enabler.   As evidence mounts that North Korean hackers may have links to the ransom assaults that destroyed more than 200,000 computers, their motives appear twofold: financial gain -- which does not appear to be turning out so well -- and proof that Pyongyang has the means to cause significant damage, with or without a nuclear weapon.   Cyberattacks are also a way for the country to inflict damage with little risk of a military response. They are inexpensive and hard to trace, and they can be profitable.   Until last year, nation states rarely used cyberattacks for financial gain. China has been tied to attacks aimed at stealing trade secrets. A handful of countries, including Russia, the United States, Iran and North Korea, have also used cyberweapons.   North Korea has been tied to gunrunning, jewel smuggling, illegal gambling and counterfeiting to pay for its military and the lifestyle of the government, but as foreign nations have clamped down on those activities Pyongyang has turned to cyberattacks for badly needed funds.   ''North Korea was always a state criminal, sheltered behind sovereignty, and now they've moved this into cyberspace,'' said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.   Over the past year, the same North Korean hacking unit that hit Sony Pictures was linked to cyberattacks at banks in Vietnam and the Philippines, and to a breach at the Bangladesh Central Bank that resulted in the theft of $81 million. Last year, the same North Korean hackers breached more than 20 Polish banks.   And while it is still too early to point the finger definitively at Pyongyang, clues in the attack code and attackers' machines suggest that the ransom attacks were the work of the same group of North Korean hackers, or of someone masquerading as them.   Though the North Korean hacking group that security experts call the Lazarus Group has been known to use different infection methods, the group's telltale code, techniques and tools were seen in the ransomware attacks.   So far, the ransomware attacks, called WannaCry, have not proved very profitable. According to the latest tally of payments made to attackers' Bitcoin wallets, victims have paid only $75,000 in ransom.   North Korea has in the past timed cyberattacks to coincide with its banned weapons tests -- like the ballistic missile launched on Sunday -- as a way of subtly flaunting its technology advances despite its global isolation.   Unlike its missile and nuclear weapons tests, however, North Korea has never announced or acknowledged its hacking abilities.   It also is possible that North Korea had no role in the attacks, which exploited a stolen hacking tool developed by the National Security Agency of the United States. Early Tuesday, the Shadow Brokers, the hacking group that spread the tool and is not believed to be linked with North Korea, threatened in an online post to start a ''Data Dump of the Month'' club, in which it would release more N.S.A. hacking methods to paying subscribers.   Security officials in South Korea, the United States and elsewhere say it is well known that the North Korean authorities have long trained squads of hackers and programmers, and that when superiors in North Korea issue instructions, these hackers are activated to attack targets.   Boo Hyeong-wook, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, said the scale of the recent attacks was large enough that it was likely to have been supported on a national level. He also said it would be a logical extension of the growing boldness of North Korean hackers.   While North Korean hackers have for years operated out of China, defectors and South Korean officials say they have been spreading to Southeast Asian countries, where government monitoring is less intense.   In countries like Malaysia, many North Korea hackers are believed to work undercover at technology companies and other jobs. Sometimes, the hackers will also run online gambling sites or even make use of ransomware to raise funds for themselves.   North Korea began training electronic warfare soldiers well before the internet era, according to defectors and South Korean officials. They selected math prodigies when they were 12 or 13 and trained them to become software developers, online psychological warfare experts and hackers.   They were also trained in foreign languages so they could operate abroad. North Korea sends students to study in Russia, China and, more recently, India to learn software and programming techniques. They return home and some are hired as hackers.   If the North Korean hackers were responsible for the disruptions suffered by Chinese computer users, that would constitute an extraordinary assault on North Korea's most important neighbor.   Mr. Boo said the changing dynamics in the relationship between China and North Korea, which once described themselves as close as ''lips and teeth,'' could be why China was attacked.   ''China has dialed up the pressure on North Korea,'' he said. ''Pyongyang faces the increased possibility that Beijing could abandon it. It made a loud statement.''     "
Iranian Hacker Charged in HBO Hacking That Included 'Game of Thrones' Script,"United States officials are charging an Iranian hacker in the theft of 1.5 terabytes of data from HBO in May, an attack that tormented network executives and included the release of several unaired programs and scripts. Behzad Mesri, who went by the pseudonym ''Skote Vahshat,'' was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, extortion and identity theft, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday in United States District Court in Manhattan. But he remains in Iran, and officials acknowledged that it would be difficult to detain him.    ''He will forever be looking over his shoulder, and if he isn't, he should be,'' Joon H. Kim, acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a news conference.    He was accused of trying to extort $6 million worth of Bitcoin from HBO in July, the indictment said.   From May to August, the data theft proved a nightmare for HBO. The hacker gradually released stolen materials on the internet, including unaired episodes of ''Ballers,'' ''Barry,'' ''Room 104,'' ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' and ''The Deuce.'' The hacker also released the script of an episode of ''Game of Thrones'' that had not yet been broadcast.   The data cache also included financial documents, cast and crew contact lists, emails belonging to at least one HBO employee and credentials for social media accounts, according to the indictment.   Though Mr. Kim said it was ''not likely'' the authorities would be able to arrest Mr. Mesri, being wanted by the F.B.I. will make it difficult for Mr. Mesri to travel internationally, he said.   ''The memory of American law enforcement is very long,'' he said.   The indictment stops short of formally accusing Mr. Mesri, 29, of working on behalf of the Iranian government, though it notes that he previously ''had worked on behalf of the Iranian military to conduct computer network attacks that targeted military systems, nuclear software systems, and Israeli infrastructure.''   Collin Anderson, an independent cybersecurity researcher who focuses on Iran, said that Mr. Mesri appeared to have ties to individuals who had carried out cyberespionage campaigns on behalf of the Iranian government, though his decision to attack HBO may have been a singular act he carried out by himself.   ''Iran's offensive cyberoperations are complex because the membership in hacking groups and the lines between groups are messy and shift over time,'' Mr. Anderson said.   He said the indictment was most likely just the tip of the iceberg when it came to Iran's offensive online activities.   ''This is a limited window into the vast activities Iran is engaged in, and it's a limited window into what the U.S. government knows about these actors,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''It's possible that the U.S. government could indict more Iranian hackers, depending on how they want to place pressure on Iran in the coming months.''   In a statement, HBO said: ''HBO has confirmed in the past that we were working with law enforcement from the early stages of the cyber incident. As far as the criminal case is concerned, we prefer to leave any comments to the US Attorney's Office.''   Mr. Mesri was not accused of participating in two other HBO security breaches over the summer. The network's Twitter account was hacked in August, and two episodes of ''Game of Thrones'' were leaked online before they were broadcast, but neither was linked to the larger data theft.   ''Game of Thrones'' didn't appear to suffer from the leaks. It set a ratings record with 12.1 million viewers for its finale, or 16.5 million when including numbers from its streaming services.

The Bright-Eyed Talking Doll That Just Might Be a Spy,"Cayla is a blond, bright-eyed doll that chatters about horses and hobbies. She plays games and accurately answers questions about the world at large. She could also be eavesdropping on your child. That's the stark warning parents in Germany received on Friday from the country's telecommunications watchdog, the Federal Network Agency, which said hackers could use the doll to steal personal data by recording private conversations over an insecure Bluetooth connection.    The watchdog said it was pulling the doll off store shelves and banning them in Germany.    ''Objects that have concealed cameras or microphones that can send information endanger the private sphere,'' said Jochen Homann, the agency's president. ''The Cayla doll is forbidden in Germany,'' he added, citing a German telecommunications law.   Mr. Homann encouraged parents to deactivate the doll, which is manufactured by United States-based Genesis Toys and distributed by the Vivid Toy group. ''This is also about protecting the rights of the weakest in society,'' he said.   The announcement reflects the growing concerns over ''smart'' products in the home that can get, well, too smart. A string of reports in recent years about hackers targeting and remotely controlling items like baby monitors have sounded the alarm.   Meanwhile, numerous experiments by researchers have shown how easy it is to hack into cars, medical devices and even dolls.   Germans are particularly sensitive to questions of privacy and data collection because of their experiences under the Nazi and Communist governments, when releasing personal details could be a matter of life and death. The nation has some of the strongest data-protection laws in the world, and it considers an individual's right to privacy to be far more important than any perceived public right to know.   ''It doesn't matter what kind of object it is,'' a spokeswoman for the network agency told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. ''It could also be an ashtray or a fire detector.''   The restrictions run the gamut in Germany. For example, ''Hello Barbie,'' an interactive doll, is sold in the United States but not in Germany, where the news media has dubbed it the ''Stasi-Barbie,'' a reference to the widely hated East German secret police that infiltrated the everyday lives of Germans to such an extent that even relatives were distrustful of one another.   Cayla is already under scrutiny in the United States. In December, advocacy groups filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that Genesis Toys had violated the rules on children's privacy because the Cayla doll records and transmits the voice prints of children to Nuance Communications, a computer-software company.   Cayla and a similar toy, i-Que, made by the same company are Internet-connected and talk and interact with children by recording their conversations.   ''These voice recordings are stored and used for a variety of purposes beyond providing for the toys' functionality,'' the complaint said.   Last year, Norway also found the products potentially in breach of its advertising regulations.   ''It's quite disturbing because the company reserves the right to direct marketing towards kids,'' Finn Myrstad, technical director of digital services at the Norwegian Consumer Council, told the BBC at the time.   Genesis Toys has not yet released a statement on the German ban. Attempts to reach the company on Friday were unsuccessful.     "
S.E.C. Says Its Computers Were Breached Last Year,"HONG KONG -- The top securities regulator in the United States said Wednesday night that its computer system had been hacked last year, giving the attackers private information that could have been exploited for trading.  The disclosure, coming on the heels of a data breach at Equifax, the major consumer credit reporting firm, will likely intensify concerns over potential computer vulnerabilities lurking among pillars of the American financial system.    The Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement that it was still investigating the breach of its corporate filing system. The system, called Edgar, is used by companies to make legally required filings to the agency.   The commission said it learned in August that an incident detected last year ''was exploited and resulted in access to nonpublic information.'' It said the security vulnerability used in the hack had been patched shortly after it was discovered.   The hack, it said, ''may have provided the basis for illicit gain through trading.''   The Equifax hack, which focused on a database that contained the personal information of 143 million Americans, focused attention on the vulnerabilities of private companies that handle sensitive personal financial information. The S.E.C. sometimes handles its own sensitive information, including disclosures that companies are allowed to keep away from  investors. Such information could give traders an edge.   In its statement, the commission did not release further details of the hack, including whether it had resulted in disclosure of any information about particular companies.   ''Cybersecurity is critical to the operations of our markets and the risks are significant and, in many cases, systemic,'' the commission's chairman, Walter J. Clayton, said in the statement. ''We must be vigilant. We also must recognize -- in both the public and private sectors, including the S.E.C. -- that there will be intrusions, and that a key component of cyber risk management is resilience and recovery.''   The commission said it did not believe that the breach had involved personal information or that it would jeopardize the commission's activities.     "
Hackers Hijack Phone Numbers To Grab Wallets,"Hackers have discovered that one of the most central elements of online security -- the mobile phone number -- is also one of the easiest to steal. In a growing number of online attacks, hackers have been calling up Verizon, T-Mobile U.S., Sprint and AT&T and asking them to transfer control of a victim's phone number to a device under the control of the hackers.    Once they get control of the phone number, they can reset the passwords on every account that uses the phone number as a security backup -- as services like Google, Twitter and Facebook suggest.   ''My iPad restarted, my phone restarted and my computer restarted, and that's when I got the cold sweat and was like, 'O.K., this is really serious,''' said Chris Burniske, a virtual currency investor who lost control of his phone number late last year.    A wide array of people have complained about being successfully targeted by this sort of attack, including a Black Lives Matter activist and  the chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission. The commission's own data shows that the number of so-called phone hijackings has been rising. In January 2013, there were 1,038 such incidents reported; by January 2016, that number had increased to 2,658.   But a particularly concentrated wave of attacks has hit those with the most obviously valuable online accounts: virtual currency fanatics like Mr. Burniske.   Within minutes of getting control of Mr. Burniske's phone, his attackers had changed the password on his virtual currency wallet and drained the contents -- some $150,000 at today's values.   Most victims of these attacks in the virtual currency community have not wanted to acknowledge it publicly for fear of provoking their adversaries. But in interviews, dozens of prominent people in the industry acknowledged that they had been victimized in recent months.   ''Everybody I know in the cryptocurrency space has gotten their phone number stolen,'' said Joby Weeks, a Bitcoin entrepreneur.   Mr. Weeks lost his phone number and about a million dollars' worth of virtual currency late last year, despite having asked his mobile phone provider for additional security after his wife and parents lost control of their phone numbers.   The attackers appear to be focusing on anyone who talks on social media about owning virtual currencies or anyone who is known to invest in virtual currency companies, such as venture capitalists. And virtual currency transactions are designed to be irreversible.   Accounts with banks and brokerage firms and the like are not as vulnerable to these attacks because these institutions can usually reverse unintended or malicious transactions if they are caught within a few days.   But the attacks are exposing a vulnerability that could be exploited against almost anyone with valuable emails or other digital files -- including politicians, activists and journalists.   Last year, hackers took over the Twitter account of DeRay Mckesson, a leader of the Black Lives Matters movement, by first getting his phone number.   In a number of cases involving digital money aficionados, the attackers have held email files for ransom -- threatening to release naked pictures in one case, and details of a victim's sexual fetishes in another.   The vulnerability of even sophisticated programmers and security experts to these attacks sets an unsettling precedent for when the assailants go after less technologically savvy victims. Security experts worry that these types of attacks will become more widespread if mobile phone operators do not make significant changes to their security procedures.   ''It's really highlighting the insecurity of using any kind of telephone-based security,'' said Michael Perklin, the chief information security officer at the virtual currency exchange ShapeShift, which has seen many of its employees and customers attacked.   Mobile phone carriers have said they are taking steps to head off the attacks by making it possible to add more complex personal identification numbers, or PINs, to accounts, among other steps.   But these measures have not been enough to stop the spread and success of the culprits.   After a first wave of phone porting attacks on the virtual currency community last winter, which was reported by Forbes, their frequency appears to have ticked up, Mr. Perklin and other security experts said.   In several recent cases, the hackers have commandeered phone numbers even when the victims knew they were under attack and alerted their cellphone provider.   Adam Pokornicky, a managing partner at Cryptochain Capital, asked Verizon to put extra security measures on his account after he learned that an attacker had called in 13 times trying to move his number to a new phone.   But just a day later, he said, the attacker persuaded a different Verizon agent to change Mr. Pokornicky's number without requiring the new PIN.   A spokesman for Verizon, Richard Young, said that the company could not comment on specific cases, but that phone porting was not common.   ''While we work diligently to ensure customer accounts remain secure, on occasion there are instances where automated processes or human performance falls short,'' he said. ''We strive to correct these issues quickly and look for additional ways to improve security.''   Mr. Perklin, who worked at a Canadian mobile phone operator before joining ShapeShift, said most phone companies would write down any additional security requests in the notes of a customer account.   But agents can generally act on their own, he said, regardless of what is in the notes, and can easily miss what is in the notes.   The vulnerability of phone numbers is the unintended consequence of a broad push in the security industry to institute a practice, known as two-factor authentication, that is supposed to help make accounts more secure.   Many email providers and financial firms require customers to tie their online accounts to phone numbers, to verify their identity. But this system also generally allows someone with the phone number to reset the passwords on these accounts without knowing the original passwords. A hacker just hits ''forgot password?'' and has a new code sent to the commandeered phone.   Mr. Pokornicky was online at the time his phone number was taken, and he watched as his assailants seized all his major online accounts within a few minutes.   ''It felt like they were one step ahead of me the whole time,'' he said.   The speed with which the attackers move has convinced people who are investigating the hacks that the attacks are generally run by groups of hackers working together.   Danny Yang, the founder of the virtual currency security firm BlockSeer, said he had traced several attacks to internet addresses in the Philippines, though other attacks have been tracked to computers in Turkey and the United States.   Mr. Perklin and other people who have investigated recent hacks said the assailants generally succeeded by delivering sob stories about an emergency that required the phone number to be moved to a new device -- and by trying multiple times until a gullible agent was found.   ''These guys will sit and call 600 times before they get through and get an agent on the line that's an idiot,'' Mr. Weeks said.   Coinbase, one of the most widely used Bitcoin wallets, has encouraged customers to disconnect their mobile phones from their Coinbase accounts.   But some customers who have lost money have said the companies need to take more steps by doing things like delaying transfers from accounts on which the password was recently changed.   ''Coinbase looks like a bank, stores millions of dollars like a bank, but you don't realize how weak its default protections are until you are robbed of thousands of dollars in minutes,'' said Cody Brown, a virtual reality developer who was hacked in May.   Mr. Brown wrote a widely circulated post about his experience, in which he lost around $8,000 worth of virtual currency from his Coinbase account, all as he sat online and watched, getting no response from the customer service at either Coinbase or Verizon.   A spokesman for Coinbase said the company ''has invested significant resources to build internal tools to help protect our customers against hackers and account takeovers, including compromise through phone porting.''   The irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions has often been lauded as one of the most important qualities of virtual currency because it makes it harder for banks and governments to intervene in transactions.   But Mr. Pokornicky said the virtual currency industry needed to alert new users to the added risk that comes with the new features of the technology.   ''It's powerful to be able to control your money and move things without any permission,'' he said. ''But that privilege requires a clear understanding of the downside.''     "
Digital Security Provider Raises $100 Million to Tackle Booming Market,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Cybersecurity has been in the news seemingly nonstop, including the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the ransomware attack this weekend that took aim at computer systems worldwide. In other words, it's not a bad time for a security specialist to be raising money.    CrowdStrike, the provider of digital security that aided the D.N.C. in its response to what is believed to be interference by Russia, announced on Wednesday that it had raised $100 million in capital.    The new money values the company at close to $1 billion, not including the investment itself, and brings its total fund-raising to $256 million.   It is the latest indication that investors remain intensely interested in online security. Last year, there were more than 400 investments in the sector, up about 6 percent from 2015, totaling nearly $3.5 billion, according to data from CB Insights. Four start-ups in the field raised at least $100 million each in new rounds.   But businesses faced an increasing number of threats. The ransomware attack, in which data was held hostage by malicious software, has highlighted the changing and growing nature of digital crime. (Even big organizations like the Walt Disney Company are not immune; its chief executive reportedly said on Monday that hackers had threatened to release a coming movie online unless they received a ransom.)   That has meant more work for CrowdStrike. The company, founded by two former executives of the computer security provider McAfee, has argued that relying on systems that run on cloud computing rather than those installed on customers' devices means smarter defenses and faster responses.   ''We're in the cloud, looking at a lot of end points,'' George Kurtz, the chief executive and co-founder of CrowdStrike, said in an interview, referring to customers' computers and systems. ''It helps us prevent an incident from becoming a breach.''   Since its start, CrowdStrike has taken what Mr. Kurtz likens to a Salesforce-like modular approach to systems: plenty of options for customers.   The new round of money comes as the six-year-old company undergoes rapid growth. CrowdStrike said subscriptions had grown 476 percent in the last year. It says more than 10 percent of the Fortune 1,000 are customers.   The company also now has more than 650 employees around the world.   Much of that growth, Mr. Kurtz said, came from word of mouth as customers praised the company's offerings. But the company's role in helping the D.N.C. ''certainly raised our profile and awareness,'' he said.   Mr. Kurtz said that CrowdStrike had already raised $100 million in the summer of 2015. But even though it did not need the additional capital, it began seeking new funds about three months ago, he said.   An existing investor, the venture capital firm Accel, led the new round. Other participants include other existing investors like CapitalG, an arm of Google's parent company, and Warburg Pincus, the private equity firm, as well as newcomers like March Capital Partners and Telstra, a telecommunications provider in Australia.   Accel chose to spearhead the round because of CrowdStrike's promise as a leader in enterprise security, Sameer Gandhi, a partner at Accel, said in a news release.   The new infusion of cash will go toward geographical expansion and the development of additional products as well as potentially for small acquisitions. At the same time, it must shore up its competitive position against rivals, all of which are pitching similar cloud-based offerings.   Mr. Kurtz said that the company was committed to increasing its market share, rather than going public or preparing itself for a sale.   ''We believe we have the scale to go out in the short-to-medium term,'' he said of any potential initial public offering. ''But having optionality is our preference.''     "
"After Ransomware Attack, Windows XP Is Not Back From the Dead","Q. With the recent ransomware attacks, I was wondering if Microsoft will once again have security updates for Windows XP. There are millions of people who are still using XP, and it is one way hackers can use to infect newer computers, especially if XP is no longer secure.   A. The global WannaCry ransomware attack that hit unpatched Windows systems in May and spread rapidly around the world over the course of several hours did prompt Microsoft to issue a security update for its retired Windows XP system; that fix also blocks last week's Petya worm. Do not expect regular updates, however.    According to Microsfoft, the decision to release updates for Windows XP was an exception based on threat risks and the potential impact to its customers and does not signal a change to its policy. The company recommends that customers upgrade to the latest version of Windows.   Perhaps the safest way to still use an old XP machine is to disconnect it from the internet and relegate it to being a PC gaming console or an offline word processor directly connected to a local printer. As the years go on, finding programs for the outdated system (first introduced back in 2001) will be difficult, as most companies stopped developing software for Windows XP years ago.   For example, Mozilla Firefox is one of the few major web browsers that still support Windows XP, although the company says it will provide Firefox security updates only until September. If you want to keep using a Windows XP machine on the internet, third-party security software may be the only shield you have left from online threats. Avast and Kaspersky are two companies that still offer XP-compatible programs.

Farhad's and Mike's Week in Tech: Uber Isn't Everything,"Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad: Hello, Mike! It's been a long week. You've been slammed with the barrage of news coming out of Uber. From what I can tell, you've written 300 stories in the last week, and a few of them were surprisingly good.    I have been very busy preparing for my coming vacation. So, tough times for both of us.    Mike: I hope you're going somewhere cool, like your trip to Africa that one time. I, too, need a vacation after the unremitting hellscape of Uber news that was my last week. But I'm thinking a staycation in the Bay Area -- maybe 48 hours in a hot tub. Or maybe I'll scrap all that and just do some more Uber coverage.   Farhad: But I really don't want to talk about Uber. It's all anyone in tech can talk about. So let's just go through a quick rundown on the news about the car-sharing company and then move on to everything else that happened in tech this week.   So here's the rundown: Travis Kalanick, Uber's founder and C.E.O., resigned after receiving what amounted to an ultimatum from some of the company's most powerful investors. There was a lot of drama. Anyone who wants details should read your great story about it.   And, that's about it. Let's move on.   Mike: Yeah, let's talk about ''The Simpsons'' or something. Do kids still care about that?   Farhad: Maybe 32-year-old kids like yourself.   To me, the scariest story of the week came from our colleague Nicole Perlroth, who dug into a recent cyberattack on a company called IDT. The attack depended on network security vulnerabilities that had been stolen from the National Security Agency. The attackers are unknown, but their methods made such effective use of the ''back doors'' discovered by the N.S.A. that security experts worry that many other computers could be at risk, including those connected to health systems, utilities and transportation.   In other words: Be very afraid!   Mike: That's a big pet peeve of mine that we've never really dug into -- at least not in the newsletter. The N.S.A. has a huge incentive to keep quiet about software vulnerabilities and collect them. It's kind of similar to stockpiling arms in preparation for war, except we can probably assume that we're already constantly at war, with governments hacking one another silently in the background.   So what makes them stop? I dunno, probably getting lots of coverage in The New York Times about the fallout from stockpiling these vulnerabilities once they get out into the wild and are used and exploited by others.   Farhad: Sure. Getting a lot of negative press coverage always makes people change their ways. That's how life works.   Mike: Well, side note from me: I'm in Anaheim for VidCon, which is seriously one of the more surreal experiences of my life.   If you're unfamiliar with it, VidCon is the place where all of the social media stars and their fans go to congregate. We're talking Liza Koshy, Lele Pons, Logan Paul and all sorts of superfamous YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram stars who you or I are far too old to have any knowledge of whatsoever.   Imagine watching Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt or some boy band walk around a mall packed with screaming teens trying to get selfies, times 1,000. That's somewhat close to VidCon.   I never really appreciated the extent to which these young celebrities have figured out how to make themselves a viable brand and really build businesses around themselves from their online followings. Hey, maybe we should start doing that? SponCon, anyone?   Farhad: What do you mean? I already am a social media star!   I also wanted to chat about a story about another (allegedly) gross man in Silicon Valley. The Information reported that six women have accused Justin Caldbeck, who runs a venture capital firm called Binary Capital, of making inappropriate advances toward them while discussing business, including while seeking funding from him.   What was particularly interesting about the piece was that three of the women went on the record -- they put their names to their allegations, which is an incredibly unusual and brave thing to do in the hush-hush, male-dominated world of tech financing. Caldbeck denied doing anything wrong but also said he regretted ''ever causing anyone to feel uncomfortable.''   Ugh, men in tech.   Men in the Valley have a long history of getting away with a lot of terrible behavior. This could be one of those times. But after everything that's happened at Uber following the former Uber engineer Susan Fowler's disclosure of sexual harassment there, I also wonder if a new, less-tolerant-of-terrible-people wind may be blowing through tech.   In fact, on Friday, Axios reported that Caldbeck was taking an indefinite leave of absence from his venture firm.   What do you think?   Mike:  I was thinking along these very lines today. Susan's post speaking out has really empowered a lot of women across the Valley to speak their own truths about a supergross business that is usually only whispered about.   I think it's great, and I hope it keeps coming. Shedding light and putting that behavior under the public spotlight is usually the most effective way of curbing it. I cannot tell you how many people have DM'd me on Twitter to tell me about their experiences at other companies that have nothing to do with Uber but have similar issues.   Anyway, I think I hear some Uber news breaking. Gotta run.   Farhad: Me too, I have to wash my bathing suit. See ya!   Follow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter @fmanjoo and Mike Isaac @MikeIsaac.     "
North Korea Is Said to Be Target of Inquiry Over $81 Million Cyberheist,"Federal prosecutors are investigating North Korea's possible role in the theft of $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh in what security officials fear could be a new front in cyberwarfare. The United States attorney's office in Los Angeles has been examining the extent to which the North Korea government aided and abetted the bold heist in February 2016, according to a person briefed on the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly.    In the theft, the attackers, using a global payment messaging system known as Swift, were able to persuade the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to move money from the Bangladesh bank to accounts in the Philippines. The Swift system is used by some 11,000 banks and companies to transfer money from one country to another.    In the months that followed the Bangladesh heist, it was disclosed that cyberthieves had also attacked banks in Vietnam and Ecuador using Swift.   North Korea's involvement in the attack on the Bangladesh bank had not been publicly known until The New York Times reported last May that security researchers had found evidence that pointed to the country. The researchers discovered that a rare piece of code used in the theft had also been used in the hacking attack on Sony Pictures in December 2014.   Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles are also investigating the Sony breach, and what they uncovered in that inquiry led them to examine the bank theft.   United States security officials have largely been quiet about whether North Korea was linked to the bank attacks, even as they have publicly attributed the Sony breach to Pyongyang.   That reticence is now slipping, however. On Tuesday, Richard Ledgett, a deputy director of the National Security Agency, noted the research that tied the two attacks ''forensically'' and said that if North Korea's role in the bank robbery was confirmed, it would represent a troubling new front in cyberwarfare.   ''That is a big deal,'' Mr. Ledgett said at an event sponsored by the Aspen Institute.   John Carlin, the head of the Aspen Institute's cybersecurity and technology program, who served as assistant attorney general for national security during the Obama administration, asked whether Mr. Ledgett believed that ''nation states are now robbing banks.''   Mr. Ledgett responded, ''I do.''   The renewed focus on North Korea's cyberactivities comes as the Trump administration seeks to take a tougher line on that country's nuclear program.   After a recent trip to Asia, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said that North Korea posed an imminent threat and seemed to suggest that the United States might have to take pre-emptive military action.   The breach of the Bangladesh central bank exposed how banks of all sizes are vulnerable to cyberattacks using the Swift network, once thought to be among the most secure messaging systems in the world.   Investigators believe that the attackers gained access to the bank's Swift credentials, possibly from someone who worked there.   Using those credentials, the attackers then sent messages over Swift to the New York Fed, authorizing the release of the funds from the Bangladesh bank account there.   The New York Fed released some of the $951 million to accounts in the Philippines, as requested by the attackers. But officials in New York halted the full transfer when they noticed that something seemed amiss.   Swift has been urging the thousands of banks that belong to its network to take precautions. A Swift spokeswoman declined to comment on Wednesday.   Mr. Ledgett said on Tuesday that large companies and banks might be fundamentally outmatched by nation-state cyberattackers and suggested that the United States government needed to do more to help bolster their defenses.   It is as if the ''security guards at Home Depot and Target'' are expected ''to stand up to the North Korean Army,'' said Mr. Ledgett, who plans to retire soon from the National Security Agency. ''On the face of it, it doesn't make sense.''   News of the criminal investigation into North Korea's role in the Bangladesh bank attack was reported earlier on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal. It was not clear whether any charges from the investigation were imminent.     "
Target to Pay $18.5 Million to 47 States in Security Breach Settlement,"Target will pay $18.5 million to 47 states and the District of Columbia as part of a settlement with state attorneys general over a huge security breach that compromised the data of millions of customers.  The settlement ends a yearslong investigation into how hackers obtained names, credit card numbers and other information about tens of millions of people in 2013.    New York will receive $635,000, while California will receive $1.4 million, the largest amount of any state, according to the Eric T. Schneiderman, New York's attorney general. Dollar figures were determined ''largely'' based on each state's population size, his office said.   Wyoming, Wisconsin and Alabama were not included in Tuesday's announcement. Representatives for the attorneys general in those states did not have an immediate comment or could not be reached.   In a statement, Target said that it was ''pleased'' to have resolved the issue. Target has spent $202 million on legal fees and other costs since the breach, according to the company's most recent annual statement.   The investigation, led by attorneys general in Connecticut and Illinois, concluded that attackers had stolen credentials from a third-party vendor that they used to access a customer database. They then installed malware that helped capture other consumer data.   As part of the settlement, Target agreed to tighten its digital security, including maintaining software and encryption programs to safeguard people's personal information. The retailer will have to separate its cardholder data from the rest of its computer network and pay for an independent assessment of its security measures, according to Tuesday's announcement.   On Dec. 19, 2013, during the biggest shopping season of the year, Target confirmed that credit and debit card information about 40 million customers had been stolen. Several weeks later, the company said that other information for 70 million people, including email and mailing addresses, had also been exposed.   After an internal review, Target acknowledged that it had missed signs of the data breach. The disaster helped push out the chief executive of Target, Gregg W. Steinhafel, who resigned in May 2014. Target's current chief executive, Brian C. Cornell, took over in August of that year.   Hackers went on to target other retailers, including Home Depot, in a series of digital attacks aimed at stealing sensitive customer information from millions of consumers around the country.     "
Chinese National Is Arrested in Connection with U.S. Cyberattacks,"The Justice Department on Monday charged a 36-year-old Chinese national, Yu Pingan, with conspiring with two other Chinese nationals to hack the computer networks of three unnamed companies in the United States. Among the hacking tools Mr. Yu was accused of using was malicious code that was later connected to an attack on United States government computers at the Office of Personnel Management and a number of insurance companies, including Anthem.    The case was one of the first brought against a Chinese national since a 2015 agreement between President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China to refrain from computer-related theft of industrial trade secrets.    Mr. Obama warned Mr. Xi in 2015 that the United States would pursue and punish perpetrators with traditional law enforcement and potentially resort to sanctions.   A complaint unsealed in federal court on Tuesday in San Diego did not name the cyberattack victims but said they were based in Los Angeles, San Diego and Massachusetts.   Mr. Yu was accused of using malicious software known as Sakula as far back as December 2012. At the time of those attacks, the F.B.I. had identified only one previous use of Sakula malware, in November 2012, suggesting that Mr. Yu was among a small group of hackers using the malicious code, the complaint said.   The Sakula malware was later found in a series of other cyberattacks against United States government computers.   Those attacks, which were discovered in 2015, allowed hackers to steal extensive personal information on government employees and insurance databases, including addresses, health and financial histories, fingerprints and other private details from millions of people who had been subjected to American government security-background checks.   The complaint does not otherwise tie Mr. Yu to the hacks of the Office of Personnel Management and Anthem, and it does not mention the names of the three companies.   However, the complaint noted that hackers used a misspelled version of the domain of one Los Angeles-based company, Capstone Turbine, to target their victims.   The same technique was used by Chinese hackers in the Anthem attacks and assaults on other health insurers.   Capstone Turbine did not respond to requests for comment.   Mr. Yu was arrested Monday at the Los Angeles International Airport and made his first appearance on Tuesday in federal court in San Diego.   His lawyer, Michael Berg, said Mr. Yu was expected to have a detention hearing on Aug. 31.   According to the complaint, Mr. Yu, who lives in Shanghai, was an expert in computer network security and computer programing. His lawyer said Mr. Yu was a computer science teacher.   Mr. Yu, who goes by the online alias ''goldsun,'' sold various hacking tools, including so-called zero-day exploits that allowed other hackers to remotely seize control of victims' computers and websites, the complaint said.   Mr. Yu and his co-conspirators used those tools to breach the networks of companies in the United States and Europe, and in some cases take over their websites, according to the complaint.   Mr. Yu's arrest was unusual. In previous cases, Justice Department indictments against Chinese nationals were largely symbolic, since there was little chance the Chinese government would turn them over.   The last high-profile indictment of Chinese nationals occurred in 2014, when the Justice Department indicted five members of the Shanghai-based People's Liberation Army hacking unit, known as Unit 61398. China has not turned over the accused hackers to the United States and has denied culpability.   The F.B.I. said it tracked the attacks back to Mr. Yu and the two unnamed hackers by tracing their internet addresses and hacking tools, and by monitoring their web communications as far back as 2011.

"How to Catch Hackers? Old-Fashioned Sleuthing, With a Digital Twist","LONDON -- Bank robbers wear masks and escape in vans with stolen license plates. Kidnappers compose ransom letters from newsprint to elude handwriting experts. Burglars target houses with the upstairs window ajar. Cybercriminals do much the same.    They hide behind software that obscures their identity and leads investigators to look in countries far from their actual hide-outs. They kidnap data and hold it hostage. And they target the most vulnerable companies and people whose information is poorly protected.   Cybercrimes, like the global ransomware attack that began Friday and has affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries, are in a way an updated version of ancient criminal methods.   And in the global search for the criminals that continued Sunday, investigators are following much the same process that detectives in the physical world have used for decades: secure the crime scene, collect forensic evidence and try to trace the clues back to the perpetrator.    But for all of their similarities to traditional crimes, cyberattacks have major digital twists that can make them much harder to solve and can greatly magnify the damage done.   The latest attack has claimed at least 200,000 victims worldwide, according to an estimate on Sunday by Europol, Europe's police agency, and new variants of the malware are emerging, leading security experts to warn that the fallout could spread as people return to work on Monday.   Such a large, complex and global crime outbreak means any hope of a successful investigation will require close teamwork among international law enforcement agencies -- like the F.B.I., Scotland Yard and security officials in China and Russia -- often wary of sharing information with one another.   ''With cybercrime, you can operate globally without ever having to leave your home,'' said Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and cyberoperations at Government Communications Headquarters, Britain's equivalent of the National Security Agency. ''Catching who did this is going to be very hard, and will require a level of international cooperation from law enforcement that does not come naturally.''   The only institutional arrangement for international cooperation on cybercrime is the so-called Budapest Convention, whose membership is largely restricted to Western democracies, said Nigel Inkster, a former assistant chief of Britain's secret intelligence service, MI6.   Authoritarian states such as Russia and China have refused to sign on to the agreement because it permits the digital equivalent of hot pursuit: A police force investigating a cybercrime can access networks in other jurisdictions without first seeking permission.   ''Any investigation of the recent ransomware attack will have to be done by a coalition of the willing,'' Mr. Inkster said.   There are signs a coalition is coming together, at least in parts of the international system. Europol said its team of cybersecurity specialists -- made up of agents from countries like Germany, Britain and the United States -- was investigating the attack.   Europe and Asia were the regions most affected by the crime, with hospitals, car plants and even the Russian Ministry of Interior falling prey to the malware, which takes over a computer, locks down the machine and releases it only when the owner has paid a ransom.   Hours after the attack was first reported in Britain, where the computer systems of the National Health Service were crippled, law enforcement agencies across Europe, Asia and the United States began looking for clues that could trace the assault to specific people or organizations.   As with a physical crime scene, the first step with any cyberinvestigation is to make sure the criminal is no longer hiding out, about to pounce again.   ''Before we get into who did it, we try to figure out if the bad guys still have access,'' said Theresa Payton, a former chief information officer of the White House and founder of Fortalice, a cybersecurity firm. ''Are they still hiding? Are they going to come back tomorrow? Is the door that let them in still ajar? Can they inflict more pain?''   ''And if so, where are they?'' she added. ''How do we cordon them off to mitigate further damages?''   Instead of searching the closets of a property that has been broken into, investigators will examine the affected server, online software caches and emails to identify any malware that might not have been activated yet.   In the case of the ransomware that was unleashed Friday and is known as WannaCry, Wcry or Wanna Decryptor, it was quickly determined that updating Windows software with the latest security patch was enough to inoculate computers that had not been infected.   Then the forensic work begins, with agents looking for digital fingerprints.   Because of the highly technical nature of these investigations, private data security teams can be expected to help in the search. That includes working directly with law enforcement to uncover clues left behind by the attackers, as well as tracking the virus and its effects separately to protect their corporate clients. These firms have been instrumental in solving some cases.   In the WannaCry case, the phishing emails sent by the criminals with the infected link are a key piece of evidence. Patricia Lewis, the international security research director at Chatham House in London, likened the text of the email to a physical letter and its metadata to the envelope it arrives in.   ''An envelope has lots of information on it: the stamp with the time and place it was sent from, the handwriting or printer type, a sender's address, maybe a fingerprint or DNA from saliva on the seal,'' Ms. Lewis said.   Criminals are aware their emails contain revealing clues, and they try to cover their tracks. ''People use cloakers, which hide your identity, making you look as if you are someone and somewhere else,'' she said.   Like tracing the license plates of a stolen car back to the wrong person, this can lead investigators astray. ''But a good detective can track them,'' Ms. Lewis said. ''They always leave digital bread crumbs that can be followed.''   Investigators will check whether the email address the malware came from is linked to social media accounts, past cybercrimes or other locations on the web. They will study the domain name it is linked to. And they will look for patterns to try to connect one crime to others.   Success often depends on whether law enforcement can tie small digital details, including potential mistakes or a certain style in the programming code, back to the criminals. The location of where some of the ransom money is withdrawn can also help connect the dots.   Sometimes the patterns that lead investigators to their target can be surprising. One state-sponsored hack was traced to Russia because detectives noticed those responsible were online only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Moscow time, Ms. Lewis recalled. In another case, hackers were observing Chinese holidays.   When Sony was hacked, officials linked the malware that was used to one that had been used before in North Korea. ''That was a big clue,'' Ms. Lewis said. ''But of course it could have been deliberately planted.''   In the recent hack of the political campaign of the new  president of France, Emmanuel Macron, for instance, security experts were able to link the registration of certain website domains used in the attack to Russian hackers.   Investigators in the latest attack are looking for clues in the ransom notes written in more than 20 languages. Some suggested that the assailants might have connections to China because the Mandarin version of the text was better written than its English equivalent.   Once equipped with enough identifying data to start narrowing down suspects, investigators will go undercover to listen to the chatter on technology boards where cybercriminals are known to spend time. ''It's like using an undercover operative purporting to be part of a criminal gang, except it's online,'' Mr. Inkster said.   ''Half the dark web are cyberagents these days,'' Ms. Lewis joked. ''They're tripping over each other.''   One of the most challenging new developments for investigators is the use of Bitcoin, a digital currency with little oversight.   In the latest attack, the criminals demanded ransoms ranging from $300 to $600, to be paid in Bitcoin.   Bitcoin accounts, or wallets, are extremely difficult to trace. While law enforcement agencies have cracked cases by tracking Bitcoin transactions, the process is arduous.   It could take months, if not years, for law enforcement agencies to pinpoint the identity of the attackers.   Ultimately, in the world of computers, as in the physical world, investigators rely on criminals to make a mistake.   As Adam Malone, a former cyberagent for the F.B.I., put it, ''A lot of times we catch bad guys because they get sloppy.''     "
"Mystery of Motive for a Ransomware Attack: Money, Mayhem or a Message?","SAN FRANCISCO -- As governments and organizations around the world grappled on Wednesday with the impact of a cyberattack that froze computers and demanded a ransom for their release, victims received a clear warning from security experts not to pay a dime in the hopes of getting back their data. The hackers' email address was shut down and they had lost the ability to communicate with their victims, and by extension, to restore access to computers. If the hackers had wanted to collect ransom money, said cybersecurity experts, their attack was an utter failure. That is, if that was actually their goal.    Increasingly sophisticated ransomware assaults now have cybersecurity experts questioning what the attackers are truly after. Is it money? Mayhem? Delivering a political message?    In the attack that hit computers from Ukraine to the United States on Tuesday, financial gain may be the least likely motive.   ''Either it was a sophisticated actor who knew what they were doing -- except screwed up horribly on the part where they actually get paid,'' said Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute and a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, ''or it wasn't about the ransom in the first place.''   Ransomware, one of the oldest and most prolific forms of cyberattack, relies on encrypting a victims' files, essentially locking them out of their own computer systems, until they pay a ransom. Last year, cybersecurity researchers estimate that criminals made over $1 billion through ransomware, with victims ranging from the chief executives of Fortune 500 companies to mom-and-pop businesses and private individuals.   The attack on Tuesday, like a similar assault in May called WannaCry, spread wider and faster than previous forms of known ransomware. But combined, they barely banked $100,000.   WannaCry spread by combining traditional ransomware with a worm, or a mechanism by which the attack could quickly grow. It was the first of its kind, said cybersecurity researchers, in that its goal appeared to be spreading as quickly as possible, rather than to successfully collect ransoms from victims.   The attack on Tuesday is being called by different names, including Petya, NotPetya and GoldenEye. Like WannaCry, it also appeared built for speed, as it spread across systems, exploiting a single unprotected machine to then infect machines across a network.   WannaCry's spread was halted by an independent cybersecurity researcher, who discovered that by registering a single domain for about $10 he could stop the attack in its tracks. Though Tuesday's assault does not appear to have finished, it is no longer likely to generate significant payments, because a German email provider shut down the email address associated with the ransom.   ''They are no longer collecting a ransom,'' said Justin Harvey, managing director of global incident response at Accenture Security. ''They are just being destructive.''   When criminals stage a ransomware to make money, they set up multiple avenues to collect funds from their victims, Mr. Harvey said. By contrast, the recent, widespread attacks used ''immature'' methods, like a single email address and a single Bitcoin wallet for electronic payments.   But considerable attention was paid to the technical details of launching the attacks and ensuring they would spread as fast as possible.   Security researchers said the attack on Tuesday originated in Ukraine, seemingly timed to hit a day before a holiday marking the 1996 adoption of Ukraine's first constitution. More than 12,500 machines in the country were targeted, according to Microsoft, though the online attack spread to 64 other countries.   While law enforcement officials struggled to determine who was behind the attack, Microsoft said the assailants initially focused on software run by M.E.Doc, a Ukrainian company specializing in tax accountancy. M.E.Doc acknowledged that its servers had been affected and said in a statement that it was cooperating with Ukrainian cyberpolice.   The attack targeted businesses in Ukraine, Russia and Poland, according to a post from Kaspersky Lab, a Moscow-based security firm. According to the report, those three countries as well as Italy and Germany were most affected. A number of companies in other European countries and the United States were also hit.   Still, companies and government offices worldwide appeared less affected than they were by the WannaCry attack, notably in places like China, which was hit hard in May. Reports from Asia suggested that many of the companies hit were the local arms of European and American companies that were struck on Tuesday.   In Mumbai, India, a port terminal operated by A. P. Moller-Maersk, a Danish shipping giant, was shut down on Tuesday afternoon after it disclosed that it had been affected by the malware. In a statement, Indian port authorities said they were working to relieve congestion, including finding places to park stranded cargo.   On the Australian island of Tasmania, computers in a Cadbury chocolate factory owned by Mondelez International, an American food company, displayed the ransomware message, the local news media reported.   ''We continue to work quickly to address the current global I.T. outage across Mondelez International and to contain any further exposure to our network,'' a spokeswoman for the company said, adding that it was not clear when the company's systems would be back up.   The virus also spread to the Australian branches of DLA Piper, a law firm with offices around the world. The firm warned clients that it was dealing with a ''serious global cyber incident'' and said that it had taken down its communications as a precaution.   In China, there were only scattered reports of the malware. Qihoo 360, a Chinese computer security company, said the attack hit far fewer companies and government offices than WannaCry.   Yet who was behind WannaCry and Tuesday's attack, and why they did it, remained unclear.   Brian Lord, former deputy director for intelligence and cyber operations at Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, the country's equivalent to the National Security Agency, said that rather than aiming for financial rewards, the hackers were trying to create the largest amount of disruption -- particularly in Ukraine.   But he is not convinced it was a Russian attack. ''The Russians are very smart,'' said Mr. Lord, who is now managing director for cyber and technology at PGI Cyber, an online security company. ''There's something about the blatantness of hitting Ukraine that doesn't sit well with me about this being a Russian attack.''   Both the I.P. address and the phone number connected to the internet domain registration used in this week's attack were from Iran, said Ido Wulkan, head of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm IntSights, based in Tel Aviv. The same information was connected to a different attack two months ago. ''It is possible that this is Iran, or it is possible that this is someone trying to mask themselves as Iran,'' he said.   But since the tools used in the recent attacks are widely available, a range of hackers -- criminals and state-sponsored -- would have been capable of carrying them out.   ''These types of attacks are just going to keep happening, and we've known this since we first saw how big WannaCry was going to be last month,'' Mr. Harvey, of Accenture Security, said. ''The real questions is whether these are all just practice runs for the big one.''     "
Web Defenders Detect Russian Involvement In Hack Try by Iranians,"For 18 days last month, a team of computer security experts found themselves engaged in a digital version of hand-to-hand combat with a group of hackers determined to break into the network of a military contractor. Every time the hackers, believed to be Iranian, gained a toehold in one server, the defenders shut down their access. A few days later, the hackers would come in through another digital door, and again the defenders would block them.     While dueling with the hackers, the security experts said they encountered something that they had never seen before when dealing with an Iranian cyberattack: a Russian connection.   Specifically, they found that the Iranians were using a tool set developed by a known Russian hacker-for-hire and sold in underground Russian forums. The tool had popped up in connection with an attack in Ukraine in 2015, when Russian hackers successfully shut down parts of Ukraine's power grid.   ''This is the very first time we've cataloged an attack where Iranian hackers are working with Russian hackers-for-hire,'' Carl Wright, an executive at TrapX, the Silicon Valley security firm that interdicted the hackers last month, said in an interview last week.   TrapX says it cannot name the victim of the attack, the details of which have not been reported until now, because of confidentiality agreements.   But the intrusion represented a ''historic'' partnership between Iran's hackers and Russians who are auctioning their skills and tools to the highest bidder, said Tom Kellermann, a computer security expert who previously served as the chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro, the Tokyo-based security giant, and was a member of a commission advising the Obama administration on online security.   ''Iranian hackers have dramatically increased their cyberweaponry and tactical proficiency as a result,'' Mr. Kellermann said.   Security experts outside TrapX said that it was possible that the attackers had faked the Internet Protocol address in the attack, and that Iran's hackers had simply grabbed the Russian hacking tool off the web and customized it for their attack.   Still, TrapX researchers said that several web domains used in the attack had been registered to a Russian alias, and that three email addresses continue to be used by a hacker in Russian hacking forums and in the underground web.   The security experts had become very familiar with the Iranian hackers, who had gotten the nickname ''OilRig'' because they first emerged in hackings on oil companies in Saudi Arabia and later Israel. The hackers had been moving west, targeting a growing array of military, financial and energy companies in Europe and, more recently, the United States.   Security experts said the Iran's OilRig hackers had become easy to spot over the course of hundreds of attacks on contractors, energy companies and government agencies.   By most accounts, these hackers could best be described as the ''B Team,'' not nearly as sophisticated as the Chinese, Russian or Eastern European hackers whom security firms have been monitoring for more than a decade. But what OilRig's hackers lacked in sophistication, they made up for in determination. They did their research. They were patient. When they were caught, they would wait for the dust to settle before trying again.   Researchers at TrapX came across the Russian tool set in the course of what Mr. Wright described as a running battle with the Iranian hackers last month.   More than 70 percent of the code used in the attack was identical to the code OilRig had used in hundreds of previous assaults on organizations. The targets ranged from oil companies in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, to government agencies and companies in Turkey, Europe and the United States, including a small tech firm in rural Vermont called AI Squared that helps websites serve people with visual impairments.   But in the final stage of the attack, TrapX's defenders saw a big shift in the hackers' methods, tools and techniques. ''It was a departure from anything they've done in over 200 documented attacks,'' said Moshe Ben-Simon, vice president of TrapX Labs, the company's research arm, said in an interview.   At one point, the defenders watched as the attackers got close to the part of their clients' network where the most valuable intellectual property was housed. It was in this final stage that the hackers downloaded two new sets of tools. The first was a basic hacker's kit that could do things like steal usernames and passwords.   The second tool had never popped up in an OilRig attack before. It was wrapped in encryption and had been designed to evade the techniques investigators use to figure out how a hacking tool works. It took weeks to crack the tool and extract information, Mr. Ben-Simon said.   The security researchers found OilRig code used in previous attacks, combined with a type of malware called BlackEnergy that was used in an assortment of attacks, including the 2015 effort by Russian hackers that took out parts of Ukraine's power grid. They also found that the hacking tool was conveying information from the victims' systems to a server that had also popped up in the Ukraine power grid attack.   Mr. Wright said evidence also indicated that the hacker was renting out services on the underground web.   In the end, TrapX's researchers were able to bait the attackers with a web server containing fake data aimed at tricking them into divulging their tactics, and hopefully frustrating them into giving up.   It worked. OilRig's hackers injected their malware into the server, which TrapX then analyzed and used to shut the hackers out of their clients' systems.   Mr. Wright said TrapX was willing to discuss the hack because it was the first time researchers had been able to catch OilRig hackers in the act, and record how they moved through a victim's system.   ''It was like having your camera rolling right at the right moment during a robbery on the street,'' he said.     "
A Cyberattack 'the World Isn't Ready For',"NEWARK -- There have been times over the last two months when Golan Ben-Oni has felt like a voice in the wilderness. On April 29, someone hit his employer, IDT Corporation, with two cyberweapons that had been stolen from the National Security Agency. Mr. Ben-Oni, the global chief information officer at IDT, was able to fend them off, but the attack left him distraught.    In 22 years of dealing with hackers of every sort, he had never seen anything like it. Who was behind it? How did they evade all of his defenses? How many others had been attacked but did not know it?   Since then, Mr. Ben-Oni has been sounding alarm bells, calling anyone who will listen at the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey attorney general's office and the top cybersecurity companies in the country to warn them about an attack that may still be invisibly striking victims undetected around the world.    And he is determined to track down whoever did it.   ''I don't pursue every attacker, just the ones that piss me off,'' Mr. Ben-Oni told me recently over lentils in his office, which was strewn with empty Red Bull cans. ''This pissed me off and, more importantly, it pissed my wife off, which is the real litmus test.''   Two weeks after IDT was hit, the cyberattack known as WannaCry ravaged computers at hospitals in England, universities in China, rail systems in Germany, even auto plants in Japan. No doubt it was destructive. But what Mr. Ben-Oni had witnessed was much worse, and with all eyes on the WannaCry destruction, few seemed to be paying attention to the attack on IDT's systems -- and most likely others around the world.   The strike on IDT, a conglomerate with headquarters in a nondescript gray building here with views of the Manhattan skyline 15 miles away, was similar to WannaCry in one way: Hackers locked up IDT data and demanded a ransom to unlock it.   But the ransom demand was just a smoke screen for a far more invasive attack that stole employee credentials. With those credentials in hand, hackers could have run free through the company's computer network, taking confidential information or destroying machines.   Worse, the assault, which has never been reported before, was not spotted by some of the nation's leading cybersecurity products, the top security engineers at its biggest tech companies, government intelligence analysts or the F.B.I., which remains consumed with the WannaCry attack.   Were it not for a digital black box that recorded everything on IDT's network, along with Mr. Ben-Oni's tenacity, the attack might have gone unnoticed.   Scans for the two hacking tools used against IDT indicate that the company is not alone. In fact, tens of thousands of computer systems all over the world have been ''backdoored'' by the same N.S.A. weapons. Mr. Ben-Oni and other security researchers worry that many of those other infected computers are connected to transportation networks, hospitals, water treatment plants and other utilities.   An attack on those systems, they warn, could put lives at risk. And Mr. Ben-Oni, fortified with adrenaline, Red Bull and the house beats of Deadmau5, the Canadian record producer, said he would not stop until the attacks had been shut down and those responsible were behind bars.   ''The world is burning about WannaCry, but this is a nuclear bomb compared to WannaCry,'' Mr. Ben-Oni said. ''This is different. It's a lot worse. It steals credentials. You can't catch it, and it's happening right under our noses.''   And, he added, ''The world isn't ready for this.''   Targeting the Nerve Center   Mr. Ben-Oni, 43, a Hasidic Jew, is a slight man with smiling eyes, a thick beard and a hacker's penchant for mischief. He grew up in the hills of Berkeley, Calif., the son of Israeli immigrants.   Even as a toddler, Mr. Ben-Oni's mother said, he was not interested in toys. She had to take him to the local junkyard to scour for typewriters that he would eventually dismantle on the living room floor. As a teenager, he aspired to become a rabbi but spent most of his free time hacking computers at the University of California, Berkeley, where his exploits once accidentally took down Belgium's entire phone system for 15 minutes.   To his parents' horror, he dropped out of college to pursue his love of hacking full time, starting a security company to help the city of Berkeley and two nearby communities, Alameda and Novato, set up secure computer networks.   He had a knack for the technical work, but not the marketing, and found it difficult to get new clients. So at age 19, he crossed the country and took a job at IDT, back when the company was a low-profile long-distance service provider.   As IDT started acquiring and spinning off an eclectic list of ventures, Mr. Ben-Oni found himself responsible for securing shale oil projects in Mongolia and the Golan Heights, a ''Star Trek'' comic books company, a project to cure cancer, a yeshiva university that trains underprivileged students in cybersecurity, and a small mobile company that Verizon recently acquired for $3.1 billion.   Which is to say he has encountered hundreds of thousands of hackers of every stripe, motivation and skill level. He eventually started a security business, IOSecurity, under IDT, to share some of the technical tools he had developed to keep IDT's many businesses secure. By Mr. Ben-Oni's estimate, IDT experiences hundreds of attacks a day on its businesses, but perhaps only four each year give him pause.   Nothing compared to the attack that struck in April. Like the WannaCry attack in May, the assault on IDT relied on cyberweapons developed by the N.S.A. that were leaked online in April by a mysterious group of hackers calling themselves the Shadow Brokers -- alternately believed to be Russia-backed cybercriminals, an N.S.A. mole, or both.   The WannaCry attack -- which the N.S.A. and security researchers have tied to North Korea -- employed one N.S.A. cyberweapon; the IDT assault used two.   Both WannaCry and the IDT attack used a hacking tool the agency had code-named EternalBlue. The tool took advantage of unpatched Microsoft servers to automatically spread malware from one server to another, so that within 24 hours North Korea's hackers had spread their ransomware to more than 200,000 servers around the globe.   The attack on IDT went a step further with another stolen N.S.A. cyberweapon, called DoublePulsar. The N.S.A. used DoublePulsar to penetrate computer systems without tripping security alarms. It allowed N.S.A. spies to inject their tools into the nerve center of a target's computer system, called the kernel, which manages communications between a computer's hardware and its software.   In the pecking order of a computer system, the kernel is at the very top, allowing anyone with secret access to it to take full control of a machine. It is also a dangerous blind spot for most security software, allowing attackers to do what they want and go unnoticed. In IDT's case, attackers used DoublePulsar to steal an IDT contractor's credentials. Then they deployed ransomware in what appears to be a cover for their real motive: broader access to IDT's businesses.   Mr. Ben-Oni learned of the attack only when a contractor, working from home, switched on her computer to find that all her data had been encrypted and that attackers were demanding a ransom to unlock it. He might have assumed that this was a simple case of ransomware.   But the attack struck Mr. Ben-Oni as unique. For one thing, it was timed perfectly to the Sabbath. Attackers entered IDT's network at 6 p.m. on Saturday on the dot, two and a half hours before the Sabbath would end and when most of IDT's employees -- 40 percent of whom identify as Orthodox Jews -- would be off the clock. For another, the attackers compromised the contractor's computer through her home modem -- strange.   The black box of sorts, a network recording device made by the Israeli security company Secdo, shows that the ransomware was installed after the attackers had made off with the contractor's credentials. And they managed to bypass every major security detection mechanism along the way. Finally, before they left, they encrypted her computer with ransomware, demanding $130 to unlock it, to cover up the more invasive attack on her computer.   Mr. Ben-Oni estimates that he has spoken to 107 security experts and researchers about the attack, including the chief executives of nearly every major security company and the heads of threat intelligence at Google, Microsoft and Amazon.   With the exception of Amazon, which found that some of its customers' computers had been scanned by the same computer that hit IDT, no one had seen any trace of the attack before Mr. Ben-Oni notified them. The New York Times confirmed Mr. Ben-Oni's account via written summaries provided by Palo Alto Networks, Intel's McAfee and other security firms he used and asked to investigate the attack.   ''I started to get the sense that we were the canary,'' he said. ''But we recorded it.''   Since IDT was hit, Mr. Ben-Oni has contacted everyone in his Rolodex to warn them of an attack that could still be worming its way, undetected, through victims' systems.   ''Time is burning,'' Mr. Ben-Oni said. ''Understand, this is really a war -- with offense on one side, and institutions, organizations and schools on the other, defending against an unknown adversary.''   'No One Is Running Point'   Since the Shadow Brokers leaked dozens of coveted attack tools in April, hospitals, schools, cities, police departments and companies around the world have largely been left to fend for themselves against weapons developed by the world's most sophisticated attacker: the N.S.A.   A month earlier, Microsoft had issued a software patch to defend against the N.S.A. hacking tools -- suggesting that the agency tipped the company off to what was coming. Microsoft regularly credits those who point out vulnerabilities in its products, but in this case the company made no mention of the tipster. Later, when the WannaCry attack hit hundreds of thousands of Microsoft customers, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, slammed the government in a blog post for hoarding and stockpiling security vulnerabilities.   For his part, Mr. Ben-Oni said he had rolled out Microsoft's patches as soon as they became available, but attackers still managed to get in through the IDT contractor's home modem.   Six years ago, Mr. Ben-Oni had a chance meeting with an N.S.A. employee at a conference and asked him how to defend against modern-day cyberthreats. The N.S.A. employee advised him to ''run three of everything'': three firewalls, three antivirus solutions, three intrusion detection systems. And so he did.   But in this case, modern-day detection systems created by Cylance, McAfee and Microsoft and patching systems by Tanium did not catch the attack on IDT. Nor did any of the 128 publicly available threat intelligence feeds that IDT subscribes to. Even the 10 threat intelligence feeds that his organization spends a half-million dollars on annually for urgent information failed to report it. He has since threatened to return their products.   ''Our industry likes to work on known problems,'' Mr. Ben-Oni said. ''This is an unknown problem. We're not ready for this.''   No one he has spoken to knows whether they have been hit, but just this month, restaurants across the United States reported being hit with similar attacks that were undetected by antivirus systems. There are now YouTube videos showing criminals how to attack systems using the very same N.S.A. tools used against IDT, and Metasploit, an automated hacking tool, now allows anyone to carry out these attacks with the click of a button.   Worse still, Mr. Ben-Oni said, ''No one is running point on this.''   Last month, he personally briefed the F.B.I. analyst in charge of investigating the WannaCry attack. He was told that the agency had been specifically tasked with WannaCry, and that even though the attack on his company was more invasive and sophisticated, it was still technically something else, and therefore the F.B.I. could not take on his case.   The F.B.I. did not respond to requests for comment.   So Mr. Ben-Oni has largely pursued the case himself. His team at IDT was able to trace part of the attack to a personal Android phone in Russia and has been feeding its findings to Europol, the European law enforcement agency based in The Hague.   The chances that IDT was the only victim of this attack are slim. Sean Dillon, a senior analyst at RiskSense, a New Mexico security company, was among the first security researchers to scan the internet for the N.S.A.'s DoublePulsar tool. He found tens of thousands of host computers are infected with the tool, which attackers can use at will.   ''Once DoublePulsar is on the machine, there's nothing stopping anyone else from coming along and using the back door,'' Mr. Dillon said.   More distressing, Mr. Dillon tested all the major antivirus products against the DoublePulsar infection and a demoralizing 99 percent failed to detect it.   ''We've seen the same computers infected with DoublePulsar for two months and there is no telling how much malware is on those systems,'' Mr. Dillon said. ''Right now we have no idea what's gotten into these organizations.''   In the worst case, Mr. Dillon said, attackers could use those back doors to unleash destructive malware into critical infrastructure, tying up rail systems, shutting down hospitals or even paralyzing electrical utilities.   Could that attack be coming? The Shadow Brokers resurfaced last month, promising a fresh load of N.S.A. attack tools, even offering to supply them for monthly paying subscribers -- like a wine-of-the-month club for cyberweapon enthusiasts.   In a hint that the industry is taking the group's threats seriously, Microsoft issued a new set of patches to defend against such attacks. The company noted in an ominously worded message that the patches were critical, citing an ''elevated risk for destructive cyberattacks.''   Mr. Ben-Oni is convinced that IDT is not the only victim, and that these tools can and will be used to do far worse.   ''I look at this as a life-or-death situation,'' he said. ''Today it's us, but tomorrow it might be someone else.''     "
I.R.S. Links Data Breach to Tool Used by Students,"WASHINGTON -- The Internal Revenue Service said on Thursday that the personal data of as many as 100,000 taxpayers could have been compromised through a scheme in which hackers posed as students using an online tool to apply for financial aid.  The breach may be the most extensive since 2015, when thieves gained access to the tax returns of over 300,000 people by using stolen data and filed fraudulent returns to get refunds.    The possibility of an attack became known in early March after the I.R.S. shut down its Data Retrieval Tool, which families used to import tax information to Fafsa, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, on the Education Department's website. The shutdown, at the height of financial aid application season, caused outrage among parents and students trying to fill out the complicated Fafsa forms.   The I.R.S. has been struggling to overhaul its defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats as its budget shrinks and its staff dwindles.   The agency became concerned last fall when it realized that it was possible for criminals to take advantage of the student loan tool that allows aid applicants to automatically populate the applications with their and their parents' tax information. The worry was that thieves might use the stolen data to file fraudulent returns and steal refunds, as they did two years ago.   ''Fortunately we caught this at the front end,'' John Koskinen, the I.R.S. commissioner, said Thursday at a Senate Finance Committee hearing. The I.R.S. does not expect the tool to be secure and operational again until October. ''Our highest priority is making sure that we protect taxpayers and their identity,'' he said.   But the breadth of the breach remains unknown, and Mr. Koskinen faced tough questions during the hearing as to why he did not act sooner.   Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the committee, wondered why Mr. Koskinen had waited several months to shut down the tool after realizing that it might be vulnerable.   Mr. Koskinen said he did not want to cut off a tool that millions of financial aid applicants use before the evidence of foul play was clear. After monitoring activity in the system, the I.R.S. noticed an unusual spike of unfinished applications in February that suggested criminals were at work.   The commissioner, who in the past has faced calls from many Republican lawmakers to resign, said that the agency had already sent out 35,000 letters to taxpayers and that it was planning to contact 100,000 people to alert them that they might be at risk. The agency believes that fewer than 8,000 fraudulent returns were filed and processed, resulting in refunds issued.   The questions about the security of data at the I.R.S. came less than two weeks before tax day and amid new calls from Republicans that Mr. Koskinen resign before his term ends in November. The commissioner has been a boogeyman for Republicans for years, because many in the party think that he has misled them over accusations that the agency overzealously audited certain conservative nonprofit groups.   Mr. Koskinen said on Thursday that he had no intention of stepping aside.   ''Where I come from,'' he said, ''if you sign up for a commitment, you complete that commitment.''

British Patients Reel as Hospitals Rush to Revive Computer Systems,"LONDON -- Martin Hardy was in his hospital gown, about to be wheeled into the operating room for knee surgery on Saturday morning at Royal London Hospital in East London, when, he said, his operation was abruptly canceled. Mr. Hardy, 52, a caregiver for his father, said his surgeon told him the operation could not be carried out because the hospital's computer system was not working and his condition was not life-threatening.    ''I was in my hospital robe literally about to go in,'' he said, wincing as he stood on crutches outside the hospital, waiting for a taxi home. ''How can anyone in their right mind do such a thing?'' he added, referring to the people behind the devastating cyberattack that affected organizations in nearly 100 countries and sent tremors across Britain's National Health Service.   A day after one of the largest ''ransomware'' attacks on record, which left thousands of computers at companies in Europe, universities in Asia and hospitals in Britain still crippled or shut down on Saturday, Amber Rudd, the British home secretary, told the BBC that the N.H.S. needed to learn from what had happened and upgrade its information technology system.    Ms. Rudd said the number of affected N.H.S. organizations in England and Scotland had risen to 48 (20 percent of the 248 public health trusts), of which all but six were back to normal. Britain's National Cyber Security Center is working with the N.H.S. to ensure the attack is contained.   The opposition Labour Party criticized the government sharply on Saturday for what it called negligence in not updating N.H.S. software after Microsoft provided a security patch against such ransomware attacks in March. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour's shadow health secretary, said in a letter to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, ''The incident highlights the risk to data security within our modern health service and reinforces the need for cyber security to be at the heart of government planning.''   Ms. Rudd conceded that the N.H.S., where many computers had outdated software vulnerable to malware and ransomware, had been ill prepared, despite numerous warnings. ''I would expect N.H.S. trusts to learn from this and to make sure that they do upgrade,'' she said.   For some, her words offered little comfort. ''National Hacked Service,'' said the headline in The Sun on Saturday, reflecting the frustration of Britons for whom the vaunted but chronically underfunded N.H.S. is deeply bound up in national identity. So intrinsic is the N.H.S. to Britons' sense of self that the service was featured in the  opening of the 2012 London Olympics, complete with dozens of people dressed as patients and nurses dancing around illuminated beds that spelled the letters N.H.S.   On Saturday at Royal London, a world-renowned teaching hospital in the Bethnal Green neighborhood, patients expressed a mix of frustration, resignation and gratitude as the medical staff worked to provide care while still grappling with the cyberattack. The hospital, which has 675 beds and hosts one of Europe's largest accident and emergency departments, has been an imposing and beloved presence in its multicultural neighborhood since the 18th century. Welcome signs in the hospital greet visitors in English, Chinese and Arabic.   Zahid Ahmed, 23, a local shopkeeper whose son was born at the hospital, said the cyberattack was an assault on the social fabric of the neighborhood, where the hospital was part of life, from cradle to grave.   ''Everyone in this neighborhood relies on this hospital,'' he said. ''A hospital is like a mosque or a church or a school.'' Castigating the attacker, he added, ''Is there nothing sacred?''   On Saturday, some doctors and nurses there said that they had been unable to gain access to patient computer files and that they had been using paper files and recording patient histories by pen, as they had done in the pre-internet age. Several nurses said they were struggling to obtain blood test results. Members of the urology clinic said they were unable to work because the computers were down.   ''This attack is horrible because it disturbs the service and strikes at the heart of a hospital,'' said Beverly Somera, a nurse, as she left the hospital after her night shift. ''We have to do everything by hand, and this can slow things down.''   A note on the door of the emergency room warned patients that the hospital was experiencing information technology problems and that there could be delays. A man with a cast and crutches said he had been turned away.   Barts Health N.H.S. Trust, which runs the hospital, said in a statement that it was dealing with a major information technology disruption and apologized for any delays. It said outpatient appointments on Saturday had been canceled.   Fred Bird, a retired truck driver, said he had been called by the hospital earlier in the week to pick up X-rays before a colonoscopy procedure, only to arrive on Saturday morning and find the imaging department's doors closed.   ''You can't blame the hospital, but surely the N.H.S. knew this could happen?'' he said, his face reddening with anger. ''And I don't understand why their computers weren't secure. We all pay into the N.H.S., and this is what we get. What on earth is going on in this country?''   Samantha Tugushi, 28, said she had arrived at a clinic hoping to be treated for an infection, only to be turned away after a long wait. ''I guess I will go home and take a paracetamol,'' she said.   At St. Mary's Hospital in Central London, the computer systems were back up and running and the accident and emergency department appeared to be processing patients in an orderly fashion.   Still, some patients were worried about their records. Amanda Wilson, 64, who went to St. Mary's on Saturday for an X-ray, said with a nervous laugh: ''I'm worried they've lost my files. What do I do then? I don't remember all the different procedures I've been through.''   Across Britain, medical officials were grappling with how to increase security after the attack.   Dr. Krishna Chinthapalli, a senior resident at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, who predicted a cyberattack on the N.H.S. in an article published in the British Medical Journal a few days before the attack, said it was disturbing.   ''I had expected an attack,'' he said in an interview. ''But not on this scale.''   He had warned in the article that hospitals were especially vulnerable to ransomware attacks because they held vital data, and were probably more willing than others to pay a ransom to recover it. He said in the interview that many of the N.H.S. computers still ran Windows XP, an out-of-date software.   He warned that if hospitals paid the ransoms, it could lead to a slippery slope of other attacks.     "
Equifax Breach Exposed Data From 2.5 Million More People Than First Disclosed,"Millions more people were affected by Equifax's data breach than the credit bureau initially estimated, Equifax said on Monday. The company increased its estimate on the number of Americans whose personal information was potentially exposed to 145.5 million, some 2.5 million more than it had previously disclosed.     The additional accounts were found during a forensic review by Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm hired by Equifax to investigate the attack, according to a company statement.   Equifax has been reeling since its announcement last month that hackers exploited a vulnerability in its website software to access its systems and extract sensitive personal information of millions of consumers. The material that was stolen included names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver's license numbers.   Richard F. Smith, who stepped down last week as Equifax's chief executive, is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before a congressional subcommittee that is investigating the theft and Equifax's response to it. It is the first of four congressional hearings he is scheduled to speak at this week.   ''I am deeply sorry that this occurred,'' Mr. Smith said in prepared remarks released on Monday. ''Equifax was entrusted with Americans' private data and we let them down.''   Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., a longtime Equifax executive who was promoted after Mr. Smith's departure to serve as the company's interim chief executive, said that he was advised on Sunday that Mandiant had completed the forensic phase of its investigation and found the additional accounts that were potentially at risk.   ''I directed that the results be promptly released,'' Mr. Barros said in a statement. ''Our priorities are transparency and improving support for consumers.''   Equifax said it would mail written notices to the 2.5 million newly identified people.   Mandiant's review found no evidence that the thieves gained access to databases outside the United States, Equifax said. But 8,000 Canadian consumers were affected, and an investigation into whether the data of some British consumers was exposed remains in progress, the company said.     "
Study Exposes New Home for Hackers: Vietnam,"HONG KONG -- Hackers in Vietnam have been attacking foreign companies and other targets for years, seeking information and using tactics that suggest links to the Vietnamese government, a cybersecurity company said Monday. The findings, laid out in a report released by the company, FireEye, come as companies and experts look beyond traditional sources of attacks like China and Russia to deal with new or rising threats. Smaller countries are now trying their hand at hacking, experts say, as they seek to follow dissidents, undermine enemies or comb corporate files for trade secrets.    FireEye, a company based in California that deals with large network breaches, said it had watched a Vietnamese group known as OceanLotus target foreign companies in the manufacturing, hospitality and consumer products sectors since at least 2014. While identifying hackers or the governments that might back them can be difficult, FireEye said OceanLotus had used tactics similar to those in attacks previously identified by experts as having targeted Vietnamese dissidents, journalists and governments at odds with the country.    The OceanLotus group ''accessed personnel details and other data from multiple victim organizations that would be of very little use to any party other than the Vietnamese government,'' said Nick Carr, a security expert at FireEye and the primary author of the report.   Le Thi Thu Hang, a spokeswoman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, called the findings of the report ''groundless'' and said the country looked forward to working internationally to fight digital breaches. Vietnam ''does not allow cyberattacks on organizations or individuals,'' she said in an emailed statement. ''All cyberattacks or threats to cybersecurity must be condemned and severely punished in accordance with regulations and law.''   FireEye experts said OceanLotus was the first of 32 state-linked hacking groups it had identified worldwide that was neither Russian nor Chinese.   State-sponsored hacking is ''the new way to do espionage in the 21st century because it's much easier to resource compared to a human operation,'' said Tim Wellsmore, FireEye's Asia director of threat intelligence. ''This is a low-cost, high-return model.''   Plainclothes security forces in Vietnam, a one-party authoritarian state, regularly spy on journalists, activists and political dissidents, sometimes in almost comically obvious ways -- tailing them by motorbike, for example, or eavesdropping in a cafe. Activists in the Vietnamese diaspora have also reported being targeted by what they say is state-sponsored hacking.   In a 2014 blog post, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group in California, documented what it said appeared to be a state-affiliated Vietnamese hacking operation that had targeted a range of people critical of the government, including an Associated Press reporter in Vietnam and a pro-democracy blogger in California. FireEye said OceanLotus employed a similar type of email phishing, using messages to bait victims into downloading malicious software or turning over their user names and passwords.   The report also documented the group's hacking of companies from Vietnam, China, Germany, the Philippines, Britain and the United States. It did not analyze specific breaches in detail, but it said one European manufacturing company had been compromised in 2014 before building a factory in Vietnam. It also said that OceanLotus malware had been detected last year on the network of a global hospitality developer that was planning to expand into the country.   Ben Wootliff, who oversees digital security at the business consultancy Control Risks, said online crime was a risk for local and international companies in Vietnam for a number of reasons, including a rapid pace of digitalization and an improvisational business environment. ''There is a lack of desire, awareness and capability to implement decent cyberhygiene,'' he said.   The European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam and the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi said hacking was a growing problem for businesses in the country.   ''More and more companies have to hire experts and train the staff to understand the security risks that are part of their everyday working routine,'' said Amanuel Flobbe, the chairman of the Information and Communications Technology Sector Committee at the European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam.   Digital security experts say private-sector cybercriminals or activists are responsible for much of the hacking in Southeast Asia. But FireEye said OceanLotus was notable because it appeared to be state-sponsored and used some unique malware that was not commercially available.   By nature asymmetrical, hacking is a natural outlet for smaller countries to confront larger rivals. OceanLotus, for example, has attacked corporate and government entities in China that were focused mostly on oceanic development and fishing, according to a report by the Chinese internet security company Qihoo 360. That may indicate that Vietnam was seeking to learn more about Chinese plans in the South China Sea, where the two countries have disputes over islands and reefs.   The proliferation of government- and military-run hacking in developing countries also raises a broader prospect of what rules should apply to cyberconflicts. This year, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, called for a digital Geneva Convention to push back against a raft of political hackings that have targeted elections in the United States and Europe. Reports on other hacking efforts, like United States officials' targeting of North Korea's nuclear program and North Korean hackers' attacks on Sony Pictures, have also heightened concerns.   Mr. Wellsmore said state-sponsored hacking groups in Asia were increasingly using multimillion-dollar tools to achieve their goals.   ''That sort of level of sophistication is generally nation-state-sponsored,'' he said, ''because they're the ones that have that strategic interest and are willing to invest that sort of money.''

"Equifax Breach Spurs Inquiry, but New Rules Unlikely After Years of Laxity","At a congressional hearing last week, financial industry representatives pushed for legislation that would chip away at consumer protection rules governing the three major credit reporting bureaus. Loosening those regulations ''would provide economic stability'' by capping the industry's exposure to class-action claims, a trade group official testified. Hours later, one of the three bureaus, Equifax, disclosed a major data breach, which has potentially compromised the sensitive personal data of more than 143 million Americans.    Capitol Hill is now demanding answers about the cyberattack. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and at least six state attorneys general have opened investigations.    While authorities and consumers are calling for action, the push is unlikely to translate into new rules or legal curbs.   The credit bureaus have for decades successfully fended off calls in Congress for more oversight, despite warnings about potential problems that go back to Senator William Proxmire, a Wisconsin Democrat, in the 1960s. Now, the industry is likely to find support in the agenda of President Trump, who has pledged to strip away ''burdensome'' business regulations.   Regulators aren't likely to fill the void. The F.T.C., which oversees data protection, can't dole out big financial punishments. While the consumer bureau has shown a willingness to take on the industry, the agency is mainly focused on the accuracy of the data and the products that are sold to consumers.   ''I have no reason to believe that this Congress has the capacity or will to actually legislate on those issues,'' said Isaac Boltansky, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading. ''The most we could see passing is targeted legislation aimed at enhancing consumer protections following identity theft.''   For years, consumer advocates have pressed for stricter oversight of the credit bureaus and stronger privacy rules covering all companies. One often-pursued goal is a federal privacy law mandating notifications to those whose personal information has been compromised, as well as meaningful financial penalties for lax data protection.   While forty-eight states have passed  security breach notification laws, calls for a nationwide standard have repeatedly fizzled. And Equifax has been a powerful force in the legislative and regulatory arena.   Equifax spent $1.1 million on lobbying last year, up from $300,000 in 2006, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. The credit bureau recently lobbied on a range of cybersecurity issues, including ''data security and breach notification,'' ''data breach response and identity protection'' and ''cybersecurity threat information sharing.''   Equifax lobbied on two bills under scrutiny at last week's House hearing, including one called the F.C.R.A. Liability Harmonization Act. The six proposals discussed at the hearing, all introduced by Republicans, would amend, and often scale back, a variety of consumer protection laws. The various proposals would ease certain mortgage lending rules, narrow the scope of debt collection restrictions and limit corporate liability by capping financial penalties for violations of the F.C.R.A., the Fair Credit Reporting Act.   Meredith Griffanti, a spokeswoman for Equifax, said the company ''works to ensure that new legislation captures the benefits of credit reporting to the U.S. economy, as well as the effects of certain regulation on the financial system.''   ''We believe in fair industry regulation,'' she added, ''and advocating for policies that protect consumers' rights, as well as the integrity of the consumer data industry.''   Congress has sounded warnings for decades.   In the 1960s, a series of congressional hearings pulled the secretive industry into a public spotlight. Aggrieved customers, academic experts, and industry insiders spoke out about how the vendors -- including Equifax, then known as the Retail Credit Company -- amassed files filled with intimate personal information on millions of people.   The bureaus hired thousands of investigators to ferret out details on subjects' financial habits and their ''moral character,'' according to the hearings. Drinking, philandering or simply having a dispute with a gossipy neighbor could lead to black marks.   Those credit files, which helped determine who could get a business loan, rent an apartment or even land a job, were available for purchase by any creditor. But they were kept hidden from the subjects themselves.   Senator Proxmire was a vocal critic of the power and the secrecy of credit bureaus. Without strict oversight, he thought the industry might be tempted to cut corners on data protection.   ''Tight security standards are expensive,'' he said during congressional testimony in 1969. ''Since credit bureaus are almost entirely responsive to the needs of business and have little responsibility to consumers, it is difficult to see major expenditures on security systems in the absence of public standards.''   Mr. Proxmire helped lay the groundwork for the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the main law that governs the three major credit bureaus. Passed with broad support, it was signed into law by President Nixon in 1970.   The act ''provides significant remedy and relief,'' said Leonard Bennett, a consumer attorney in Newport News, Va.   The act gave consumers the right -- for the first time -- to view their own credit reports. It also forced the credit bureaus to create a dispute process to allow people to challenge inaccuracies.   But it placed enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, which has limited supervisory powers and little ability to levy significant penalties. When the agency finds wrongdoing, it takes companies to court to force corrections, but it can generally only impose fines for repeated violations.   The F.T.C.'s approach is ''remedial,'' and focused on noneconomic punishment, said Chris Jay Hoofnagle, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who wrote a book about the F.T.C.'s enforcement of privacy laws.   With little federal oversight, the credit bureaus rapidly expanded beyond their core business of building consumer credit dossiers for lenders and other companies. In 2000, Equifax started selling online credit scores and credit monitoring products directly to American consumers. That line of business is a small, but lucrative, part of Equifax's empire.   The creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in 2011, has begun to rein in the industry, to some degree.   In a series of investigations, the C.F.P.B. found that the credit bureaus lacked sufficient quality controls to make sure consumers' data was accurate, and forced the bureaus to make changes. The agency also pressed the companies to improve their processes for fixing errors.   ''The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has moved the needle and has gotten them to think about compliance, at least on accuracy issues,'' said Chi Chi Wu, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.   One new consumer protection initiative may have been inadvertently saved by the backlash over Equifax's response to its data breach.   The consumer bureau recently finalized a rule prohibiting companies from forcing customers into arbitration over disputes, a method that companies have used to block class-action lawsuits. Equifax initially included a mandatory arbitration clause in the fine print of the free credit monitoring product offered in the wake of the attack -- language that could have prevented victims from banding together in court.   Customers immediately cried foul. Equifax quickly backed down and removed the clause.   A bill to repeal the consumer bureau's arbitration rule passed the House in July, but has not yet been voted on in the Senate. Now, it is considered highly unlikely to advance.     "
"British Parliament Is Hit by a Cyberattack, Affecting Emails","LONDON -- The British Parliament was the target of a cyberattack that left many legislators unable to connect to their email on Saturday as remote access to accounts was disabled as a security measure.  Legislators were made aware of the problem on Friday night, and Chris Rennard, a Liberal Democrat member of the House of Lords, publicized the problem in a Twitter message on Saturday, saying those with ''urgent messages'' should text him.    Cyber security attack on Westminster Parliamentary e.mails may not work remotely Text urgent messages @LibDemLords @LabourLordsUK @Torypeers -- Chris Rennard (@LordRennard) June 24, 2017   Last week, there were reports in The Times of London that the passwords of British cabinet ministers, ambassadors and senior police officers were being sold online after Russian hacking groups gained access.   According to The Times, the stolen data revealed the private login details of 1,000 British members of Parliament and parliamentary staff, 7,000 police employees and more than 1,000 Foreign Office officials.   The National Cyber Security Center, which was set up to protect the country against cyberattacks, said that it would reissue guidance to government departments after being presented with the findings.   The parliamentary authorities are also working with the center to protect the network and ascertain the scale of the damage, according to a spokeswoman for the House of Commons, who did not provide a name by British convention.   In a statement, the spokeswoman said that ''the Houses of Parliament have discovered unauthorized attempts to access parliamentary user accounts. We are continuing to investigate this incident and take further measures to secure the computer network, liaising with the National Cyber Security Center.''   To protect member and staff accounts and ''secure our network,'' the statement added, ''we have temporarily restricted remote access to the network. As a result, some members of Parliament and staff cannot access their email accounts outside of Westminster.''     "
HBO Is Hacked; Intruder Claims To Have Details From Top Series,"HBO confirmed on Monday that the network had been the target of a cyberattack, as an anonymous hacker boasted about leaking full episodes of upcoming shows along with written material from next week's episode of ''Game of Thrones.''  In an email to journalists, the hacker or hackers claimed to have obtained 1.5 terabytes of data from HBO, according to Entertainment Weekly, which broke the news. Unaired episodes of ''Ballers'' and ''Room 104'' may have been published online, and the hacker vowed more would be ''coming soon,'' the magazine reported.    HBO did not reveal what data had been stolen or posted online, and there was no immediate indication of whether the breach included customer data or personal information about employees.   In a statement, the network said: ''HBO recently experienced a cyber incident, which resulted in the compromise of proprietary information. We immediately began investigating the incident and are working with law enforcement and outside cybersecurity firms.''   In an email to employees, Richard Plepler, HBO's chief executive, said the stolen information included ''some of our programming.''   ''Any intrusion of this nature is obviously disruptive, unsettling and disturbing for all of us,'' he wrote in the email.   He added: ''The problem before us is unfortunately all too familiar in the world we now find ourselves a part of.''   It was not immediately clear what information the hackers had about ''Game of Thrones,'' the HBO megahit that has closely guarded its secrets. Now in its seventh season, the show aired its third of seven episodes on Sunday.   If hackers succeed in spoiling plot details, it would not be the first time for ''Game of Thrones.'' In 2015, the first four episodes of the fifth season were leaked online before they aired.   In April, a hacker leaked the upcoming season of ''Orange is the New Black'' more than a month before it was scheduled to be released, after Netflix refused ransom requests.     "
Equifax Made Shielding Data Part of Sales Pitch,"Equifax's chief executive had a simple strategy when he joined more than a decade ago: Gather as much personal data as possible and find new ways to sell it. The company was making good money compiling credit reports on Americans. But Wall Street wanted stronger growth.    The chief executive, Richard F. Smith, delivered, releasing dozens of new products each year and doubling revenue. The company built algorithms and started scrubbing social media to assess consumers. In a big data collection coup, Equifax persuaded more than 7,000 employers to hand over salary details for an income verification system that now encompasses nearly half of American workers.   As part of its pitch to clients, the company promised to safeguard information. It even sold products to help companies hit by cyberattacks protect their customers.   ''Data breaches are on the rise. Be prepared,'' the company said in one pitch. ''You'll feel safer with Equifax.''    But this strategy means that Equifax is entrenched in consumers' financial lives whether they like it or not -- or even know it. Equifax's approach amplified the consequences of the breach, reported this month, that exposed  the personal information for up to 143 million people.   Ordinary people are not Equifax's customers. They are the company's product. The ''Big Three'' credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, collect 4.5 billion pieces of data each month to feed into their credit reports.   From birth to death, the record grows. Decades' worth of addresses and identifying information, including drivers' licenses and Social Security numbers. Utility accounts like telephone and cable subscriptions. Criminal records, medical debt, as well as rental and eviction histories.   Equifax's records on any given individual, scattered throughout dozens of databases, typically stretch across hundreds or thousands of pages.   Equifax now faces a consumer backlash over its response to the hacking attack. The anger has been intensified by the actions of three senior executives who sold shares worth $1.8 million in the days after the breach was discovered. The stock, which had tripled in the last five years, is down 30 percent since the attack. Equifax said the executives were unaware of the breach when they sold their stock.   Customers have been less vocal, given their dependency on the bureaus. Financial firms readily hand over their data because they rely on the credit reports -- and the scores they are used to generate -- to size up potential customers. The data, over which Equifax and the other bureaus have a stranglehold, is one of the best predictors of risk.   ''We don't really have a choice to opt out of the credit report system,'' said Pete Mills, senior vice president of residential policy at the Mortgage Bankers Association, which represents some of Equifax's biggest clients, home loan providers. ''We spend a lot of money trying to protect our customers, and then we give that data to others,'' like the credit bureaus.   Equifax said it was supporting customers who may have been affected by the data breach. ''We value our customers and have been in close communication with them,'' said Wyatt Jefferies, a company spokesman.   Under Mr. Smith, Equifax has been creative in developing new markets and services. The company expanded globally, often by acquiring local competitors; it now operates in 24 countries.   New analytic products have been a priority. Equifax has a team of mathematicians who mine its data to develop algorithms predicting how consumers will behave. Those insights are sold to companies like lenders.   At a financial conference last year, Mr. Smith described a new system that searched four billion public tweets for keywords like ''car'' and ''automotive lease.'' It paired the tweets with a person's Equifax credit file. In real time, the credit bureau could identify potential buyers and provide its customer, a company selling car leases, with everything it wanted to know about those people.   The corporate culture shifted under Mr. Smith and became more focused on increasing profit, said David Galas, who left Equifax in 2011 after 13 years.   ''It was run a little more like a sports team,'' said Mr. Galas, who served most recently as a vice president. ''You immediately had to get out there and perform, and if you didn't perform, you were cut.''   Equifax's roots as a behind-the-scenes data collector stretch back to 1899, when it began as the Retail Credit Company. Grocers and other retailers kept notes on their customers to determine who could be trusted to run tabs and pay them. Two brothers in Atlanta went door to door to collect that information. They compiled it into a publication called ''The Merchant's Guide'' and sold annual subscriptions for $25.   The company and its competitors swept through the country, employing thousands of investigators to investigate people's lives. Their reports were widely available for sale to anyone except the individuals themselves.   In the 1960s, the credit bureaus' secrecy and unchecked power prompted alarm within Congress. The hearings that followed exposed the more unsavory practices, like including unverified gossip about people's marital indiscretions in their reports. The bureaus amassed personal dossiers so detailed that J. Edgar Hoover was covetous.   ''The F.B.I. is constantly in our files,'' an executive at a credit bureau testified.   Congress responded by passing the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which created some safeguards. For the first time, people were allowed to review their own files and report errors.   But the strongest agencies just kept growing, often by acquiring rivals. By the late 1990s, three big national players were left.   With little competition, the bureaus saw an opening for a new sales market: capitalizing on consumers' curiosity and concern about their credit files.   In 2001, Equifax teamed up with Fair Isaac to let people buy their three-digit FICO credit scores. Today, Equifax charges people $40 to see all three of their reports. (Consumers are entitled to one free credit report from each of the bureaus annually.)   The company's consumer business generates $400 million in annual sales, much of it through resellers. Using Equifax data, LifeLock sells identity theft protection, a booming business since the breach.   Such sales, while strong, are eclipsed by the money Equifax makes from human resources products. It entered the market in 2007 with the purchase of Talx, which verified employment for companies.   Mr. Smith viewed Talx as a beachhead into a lucrative new data field: payroll information. When Equifax bought the company, Talx held 142 million employment records. The unit now has 300 million.   ''It's been a nearly 10-year investment, but now it's paying off for Equifax,'' said Brett Horn, an investment analyst at Morningstar. ''They have something their rivals don't.''   A few expansion efforts fizzled, especially in tightly regulated markets. In 1995, Equifax teamed with AT&T to develop health care products, including electronic patient records. The effort quietly died a year later, right around the time that Congress passed a strict medical privacy bill.   As the industry expanded, safety became a sales pitch. ''We have been blessed in our rich history to never have a major breach,'' Mr. Smith said at a financial conference shortly after joining the company in 2005.   In one document, Equifax called itself the ''trusted stewards of data.''   ''If you're not ahead of security risk,'' the pitch read, ''you're behind it.''   After previous smaller breaches, the bureaus have been reluctant to offer consumers the strongest form of protection, credit freezes, free of charge. Freezing a file prevents new credit lines from being opened, which locks out identity thieves.   After Experian's servers were attacked two years ago, exposing personal details on 15 million T-Mobile customers, consumer advocates urged both companies to provide free credit freezes at all three bureaus.   Doing that would set a terrible precedent and ''haunt'' all future breaches, Experian's senior vice president of government affairs and public policy said in a response intended for executives at his company and T-Mobile. The reply was accidentally emailed to one of the advocates.   Giving in to the demand ''will not satiate their hatred for Experian,'' he added. Instead, he suggested responding with a letter explaining why fraud alerts were good enough. ''We could turn our response into a good P.R. approach if done right,'' he wrote.   Experian said in a statement that the opinions in the email did not reflect the company's position. The company said it had provided affected individuals with free credit monitoring and credit freezes at Experian at no charge.   Equifax's own response to its breach has been marred by blunders.   An Equifax website was supposed to allow customers to determine if they had been affected; it didn't work correctly. The company's Twitter account accidentally steered people toward a fake site. And when millions of consumers went to freeze their Equifax credit files, some had to pay for the service. After people  protested, the company waived the fees.   From a business perspective, it will be paramount for Equifax to keep its customers -- financial firms and other big companies -- happy.   Six of America's largest financial services companies -- American Express, Bank of America, Capital One, Citibank, Discover and JPMorgan Chase -- declined to comment on whether the breach would alter their relationships with Equifax. Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, and Kroger, the second biggest, said they were comfortable continuing to send Equifax their payroll data.   Still, some -- mainly smaller organizations -- are beginning to rethink their relationship with the company.   Summit Credit Union in Madison, Wis., filed a lawsuit against Equifax. The firm is seeking compensation for the economic harm that it said it was likely to suffer from the breach.   ''This situation has caused us all to pause,'' said Sandi Papenfuhs, senior vice president of consumer lending at another firm, First Tech Federal Credit Union in Beaverton, Ore. ''Anytime someone is not securing member data to the same degree that we do and we expect, we will take action on that relationship accordingly.''   But her credit union will continue to send Equifax data. Withholding information would only hurt consumers, she explained, because it would create an incomplete picture of their credit history.   ''I am unaware of a way to just stop, from any individual lender perspective,'' Ms. Papenfuhs said, ''and not cause consumer harm.''     "
Victims Call Hackers' Bluff as Payoff Deadline Nears in Ransomware Attack,"Follow Paul Mozur @paulmozur and Mark Scott @markscott82 on Twitter. With the clock ticking on whether a global hacking attack would wipe out his data, Bolton Jiang had no intention of paying a 21st-century ransom. Since a week ago, when the malware first struck, Mr. Jiang has been busily fixing and replacing computers at the electronics company where he works in Shanghai. Paying is a bother, he said, and there was no guarantee he would get his data back.    ''Even if you do pay, you won't necessarily be able to open the files that are hit,'' he said. ''There is no solution to it.''   Tens of thousands of computer users around the world faced the same dilemma on Friday, their last chance to pay the anonymous hackers behind the ransomware attack known as WannaCry. The malicious software exposed the widespread vulnerability of computers and offered a peek at how a new type of crime could be committed on a global scale.    As part of the hacking, attackers demanded that individuals pay a fee to regain control of their machines, or face losing their data.   The latest strain of ransomware was particularly virulent, experts warned, because it had been based on software stolen from the National Security Agency. Law enforcement agencies in the United States and elsewhere have been hunting for the culprits, with attention focused on hackers linked to North Korea.   Despite a week of widespread disruption, the total ransom paid so far looks relatively modest. An online tracking system showed that the amount sent in the electronic currency Bitcoin to accounts listed by the attackers had begun to plateau on Wednesday, and had reached about $90,000 on Friday afternoon in Europe. Early estimates of what the virus could ultimately earn had ranged into the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars. Victims have seven days to pay from when their computers were originally infected, so the deadline will vary from case to case.   A number of people and companies have struck a defiant tone. The Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, which had been identified in the news media as a victim, declined to confirm those reports on Friday but said that it had no intention of paying a ransom and that it aimed to be fully secure against future attacks by Monday.   Nissan Motor, another Japanese industrial giant, also said it would not pay a ransom. Its factory in Sunderland, England, was affected, but the company said it had not lost data.   Owners of the more than 200,000 computers across the globe that have been hit by the malware face similar decisions. Those affected, including hospitals, government offices and universities, have lost access to business information, term papers and even medical records that could involve matters of life or death.   In Britain, whose National Health Service was one of the largest organizations affected by the ransomware, some medical institutions were still struggling to get back on their feet.   Barts Health, one of the country's largest hospital groups, said that it had been forced to cancel 20 percent of outpatient appointments, as well as to cut back on nonemergency surgeries.   Yet cybersecurity experts have generally advised those affected not to pay.   ''It costs the perpetrators peanuts to carry out an attack like this,'' said Rafael Sanchez, an international breach response manager at Beazley, an insurer in London that has handled thousands of ransomware attacks for corporate clients. ''And any ransom will only likely lead to more attacks,'' he added.   While some who had paid regained access to their files, according to the Finnish cybersecurity firm F-Secure, security analysts cautioned that there was no guarantee all WannaCry victims would. Because the attackers listed only three addresses as payment destinations, it would be difficult for them to determine which victims had paid, and therefore whose files to decrypt.   ''It looks like the attackers had no intent in decrypting anything,'' said Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, a company in London that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies that helps organizations respond to digital attacks.   As victims faced an agonizing choice on Friday over whether to pay or risk losing their data, cybersecurity experts said that they had developed a potential way to decrypt individual machines without having to hand over the ransom. The technique, however, depended on how long infected computers had been hijacked by the online attackers, and required a high level of technical expertise.   According to law enforcement agencies, paying could leave victims vulnerable to being targeted again, and it also presents a challenge for people affected who have never used Bitcoin before.   Many are not familiar with the electronic currency, which does not answer to any of the world's central banks. National governments and institutions also have rules about not paying ransoms.   In Berhampur, a city of about 380,000 on India's eastern coast, two computers at the Berhampur City Hospital were hit by the WannaCry malware. Dr. Saroj Mishra, assistant health officer for the surrounding district of Ganjam, said that most of the data had been recovered -- and that health officials had no intention of paying the hackers.   ''We don't have the permission to pay the hackers,'' Dr. Mishra said. He added, ''there is no question of compromising. It is a matter of investigation.''   In other cases, those affected simply cannot afford to pay.   In China, where pirated software is believed to have contributed to the ransomware  spreading, about 4,000 of the 40,000 institutions affected are educational establishments. On Chinese social media, many students reported being locked out of final term papers.   ''The hacker asked for $300 to $600,'' said Zhu Huanjie, a college student in Hangzhou. ''Average students can't afford that.''   Mikko Hypponen, chief risk officer at F-Secure, said the overall amount of ransom that had been paid remained relatively low because large organizations -- often with detailed data retrieval plans -- had been the main victims of the attack.   Such preparations, he added, meant that while the daily activities of big organizations had been severely hamstrung in recent days, most had already replaced the affected data.   ''When you're a company with thousands of machines, you'll already have backup policies in place,'' Mr. Hypponen said.   Some attacks could also come from so-called copycats, muddying attempts to catch those behind the initial cyberattack.   Xu Hengyu, the information technology manager of Renxing Pictures, a Shanghai entertainment company, said the firm had intended to send more than $720 to hackers threatening to delete two months' worth of data. But when Mr. Xu tried to negotiate the price down, he said the hackers responded in Chinese and told him he could wire the money to a Chinese bank account in local currency rather than in Bitcoin. Mr. Xu said he was unsure whether the hackers were the same as those behind the WannaCry attack.   ''We thought about reporting to the police, but we haven't so far,'' he said. ''We thought if this problem could be solved by the direct payment, we'd rather stay that way and not go to the police, as the police must already have many cases.''   He added, ''We still prioritize data recovery over everything else.''     "
"Clock Ticking, Security Experts Scramble to Defuse Cyberattack","Follow Mark Scott @markscott82 on Twitter. Governments, companies and security experts from China to Britain raced on Saturday to contain the fallout from an audacious global cyberattack amid fears that if they did not succeed, companies would lose their data unless they met ransom demands. The global efforts came less than a day after malicious software, transmitted via email and stolen from the National Security Agency, targeted vulnerabilities in computer systems in almost 100 countries in one of the largest ''ransomware'' attacks on record.    The cyberattackers took over the computers, encrypted the information on them and then demanded payment of $300 or more from users to unlock the devices. Some of the world's largest institutions and government agencies were affected, including the Russian Interior Ministry, FedEx in the United States and Britain's National Health Service.   In Romania on Saturday, the carmaker Dacia, owned by the French carmaker Renault, sent home some employees at a large factory complex in the city of Mioveni because the attack had disrupted its systems.    As people fretted over whether to pay the digital ransom or lose data, experts said the attackers might eventually pocket more than $1 billion worldwide before the deadline ran out to unlock the computers.   But as of Saturday afternoon, the money raised by the attackers, who demanded payment using the virtual currency Bitcoin, was much lower. Funds totaling the equivalent of about $33,000 were deposited into several Bitcoin accounts associated with the ransomware, according to Elliptic, a company that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies.   That figure is likely to increase as deadlines approach for payment, security researchers said. Victims may also start digging into their wallets as others publicly confirm that paying the ransom actually unlocks their files.   ''There's no guarantee of service even if they do pay,'' said Becky Pinkard, vice president for service delivery and intelligence operations at Digital Shadows, a cybersecurity firm. ''No one on Twitter is going to care about your complaint on this one.''   The coordinated attack was first reported in Britain on Friday and spread globally. It has set off fears that the effects of the continuing threat will be felt for months, if not years. It also raised questions about the intentions of the hackers: Are they acting for mere financial gain or for other unknown reasons?   ''Ransomware attacks happen every day -- but what makes this different is the size and boldness of the attack,'' said Robert Pritchard, a cybersecurity expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a research organization in London. ''Despite people's best efforts, this vulnerability still exists, and people will look to exploit it.''   While most cyberattacks are inherently global, this one, experts say, is more virulent than most. Security firms said it had spread to all corners of the globe, with Russia hit the worst, followed by Ukraine, India and Taiwan, said Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity firm.   The attack is believed to be the first in which such a cyberweapon developed by the N.S.A. has been used by cybercriminals against computer users around the globe.   While American companies like FedEx said they had also been hit, experts said that computer users in the United States had so far been less affected than others because a British cybersecurity researcher inadvertently stopped the ransomware from spreading.   The hackers, who have yet to be identified, included a way of disabling the malware in case they wanted to shut down the attack. They included code in the ransomware that would stop it from spreading if the virus sent an online request to a website created by the attackers.   The 22-year-old British researcher, whose Twitter handle is @MalwareTechBlog and who confirmed his involvement but insisted on anonymity because he did not want the public scrutiny, found the kill switch's domain name -- a long and complicated set of letters. Realizing that the name was not yet registered, he bought it himself. When the site went live, the attack stopped spreading, much to the researcher's surprise.   ''The kill switch is why the U.S. hasn't been touched so far,'' said Matthieu Suiche, founder of Comae Technologies, a cybersecurity company in the United Arab Emirates. ''But it's only temporary. All the attackers would have to do is create a variant of the hack with a different domain name. I would expect them to do that.''   Across Asia, universities, companies and other organizations said they had been affected.   In Taiwan, threads soon began popping up on the popular online message board PTT with users' tales of how their computers had been infected and tips on how to avoid the virus.   In China, the virus hit the computer networks of both companies and universities, according to the state-run news media. News about the attack began trending on Chinese social media on Saturday. Most attention was focused on university networks, where there were concerns about students losing access to their work.   The attack spread like wildfire in Europe, including to companies like Deutsche Bahn, the German transport giant, and Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications firm, though no major service problems had been reported across the region's transportation or telecommunications networks.   Nissan, the Japanese auto giant, said its manufacturing center in Sunderland in the north of England had been affected. A spokesman declined to comment on whether production had stopped.   In Britain, the National Health Service may be one of the largest institutions affected worldwide. It said that 45 of its hospitals, doctors' offices and ambulance companies had been crippled. Surgical procedures were canceled and some hospital operations shut down as government officials struggled to respond to the attack.   ''We are not able to tell you who is behind that attack,'' Amber Rudd, Britain's home secretary, told the BBC on Saturday. ''That work is still ongoing.''   In Russia, Leonid Levin, the chairman of the parliamentary committee on information policy, said the attack showed the need for the country to add to legislation protecting ''critical information infrastructure.'' That body of laws has drawn criticism in recent years from rights groups for blocking the free flow of information into and out of Russia.   On Saturday, Russian news reports detailed attacks against computers used by the country's traffic police to deliver new drivers' licenses. The report followed confirmation that more than 1,000 computers using the Windows operating system had been affected at the country's Interior Ministry.   The cyberattack was able to spread so quickly in part because of its high level of sophistication. The malware, experts said, was based on a method that the N.S.A. is believed to have developed as part of its arsenal of cyberweapons. Last summer, a group calling itself the ''Shadow Brokers'' posted online digital tools that it had stolen from the United States government's stockpile of hacking weapons.    The connection to the N.S.A. is likely to draw further criticism from privacy advocates who have repeatedly called for a clampdown on how the agency collects information online.   Industry officials said law enforcement officials would find it difficult to catch the ringleaders, mostly because such cyberattacks are borderless crimes in which the attackers hide behind complex technologies that mask their identities. And national legal systems were not created to handle such global crimes.   Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and cyberoperations at Government Communications Headquarters, Britain's equivalent to the N.S.A., said that any investigation, which would include the F.B.I. and the National Crime Agency of Britain, would take months to identify the attackers, if it ever does.   By focusing on large institutions with a track record of not keeping their technology systems up-to-date, global criminal organizations can cherry-pick easy targets that are highly susceptible to such hacks, Mr. Lord said.   ''It was well thought-out, well timed and well coordinated,'' he said of the current attack. ''But, fundamentally, there is nothing unusual about its delivery. It is still fundamentally robbery and extortion.''   Microsoft took the unusual step of releasing free security patches for older versions of Windows, including Windows XP, that it no longer routinely updates. It said the patches could help protect users from attacks, which have not targeted Windows 10, the latest edition of the software.   ''Seeing businesses and individuals affected by cyberattacks, such as the ones reported today, was painful,'' Phillip Misner, principal security group manager at Microsoft's security response center, wrote in a blog post.   Yet security experts said the software upgrade, while laudable, came too late for many of the tens of thousands of machines that were locked and whose data could be erased.     "
Tech Roundup: Remember Chain Letters? Hackers Do,"Ransomware, a form of malicious software, has been making headlines in recent weeks. A particularly nasty strain of it took over hundreds of thousands of computers in 74 countries in about a day.  But it's not a new phenomenon. According to some cybersecurity experts, it has evolved into  a $1 billion industry. And it's predicted to become more lucrative.    How? Unfortunately, hackers have found clever -- and sometimes simple, unsophisticated -- ways to weasel their way into your digital lives.   One new attack is a bit like a Ponzi scheme. Or perhaps even a chain letter.   Often transmitted by email or web pop-ups, ransomware involves locking up people's data and threatening to destroy it if a ransom is not paid. But some hackers have a novel twist on that attack: The first message to pop up on computer screens lets the victims know they have been hacked. The second message gives them a way out.   The victims have a choice, writes Sheera Frenkel, our newest cybersecurity reporter: Pay the hackers a ransom of one bitcoin, a digital currency worth roughly $2,365, in exchange for regaining access to the computer, or try to infect two new people on behalf of the attackers.   If someone the victim knew fell for the bait and became infected, the attackers would consider the ransom paid and cede control of the infected computer. Researchers are still watching to see if the scheme is successful.     "
"Daily Report: Meet WannaCry's Meaner, More Clever Sibling","WannaCry, that cyberattack that captured tens of thousands of computers as well as the world's attention last month, was certainly bad. Imagine one day discovering your work material or family photos are locked away by a hacker who wants you to transfer some Bitcoin in his direction to set it free.  Now imagine something similar, but with a harder edge. Its creators don't seem that worried about getting a ransom -- though you can pay one if you like. It makes your computer even harder to break into and there's no way for a cybersecurity wizard to stop its spread.    That essentially describes the ransomware attack that started in Ukraine on Tuesday and spread throughout Europe and into the United States. Like WannaCry, it relied on hacking tools that were stolen from the National Security Agency and posted on the internet.   But this attack seemed to have a more specific purpose: Targeting computers in Ukraine ahead of a national holiday celebrating the creation of the country's first Constitution after breaking away from the Soviet Union.   Was it intended as a political message or an act of sabotage? Maybe a little of both? Regardless, it serves as further evidence that an array of the agency's hacking tools are out there for anyone to use, even people without sophisticated programming skills.     "
Britain Says North Korea Was Behind Cyberattack on Health Service,"Britain believes ''quite strongly'' that North Korea was behind the  ''WannaCry'' cyberattack in May that wreaked havoc on the National Health Service's computer systems and spread to more than 150 countries, a senior official said on Friday. The minister of security, Ben Wallace, told the BBC that several other countries had concluded the same thing: North Korea unleashed ''ransomware'' that buffeted institutions including universities in China, rail systems in Germany and the Russian Interior Ministry.     ''This attack, we believe quite strongly, came from a foreign state,'' he said. ''North Korea was the state that we believe was involved this worldwide attack.''   Mr. Wallace declined to elaborate on the evidence that had led to the conclusion. ''I can't obviously go into the detailed intelligence, but it is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role,'' he said.   The cyberattack on May 12, which struck thousands of computers around the word, was the largest ever to hit the N.H.S. The cyberattackers exploited gaps in the security of Windows XP to send malicious software by email that locked users out of their computer systems.   They encrypted the information on them and then demanded payment of $300 or more in Bitcoin to unlock the devices.   In Britain, the attack resulted in the abrupt cancellation of patients' operations and delays in medical appointments at dozens of hospitals that struggled to retrieve essential medical information and patient histories.   Britain's National Audit Office said on Friday that at least 6,900 appointments had been canceled during the attack, which affected more than one-third of England's 236 N.H.S. trusts. Up to 19,000 appointments may have been affected, it said.   Hospital authorities have said that no patient data was compromised or stolen during the attack. But it had particular resonance in Britain where the N.H.S., though chronically underfunded, is a vaunted part of the nation's identity.   Mr. Wallace warned that it was difficult to respond to a cyberattack committed by a ''hostile state.'' North Korea, which has ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon and has been repeatedly testing missiles despite international sanctions, has also proved adept at sowing havoc through cyberattacks.   ''North Korea has been potentially linked to other attacks about raising foreign currency,'' he said, in an apparent reference to an attack last year in which North Korean hackers tried to steal $1 billion from the New York Federal Reserve, and almost succeeded before being stopped by a spelling error.   The North has an army of 6,000 hackers, and experts in Britain and the United States say their ability to wage effective cyberattacks has improved. In 2014, the country unleashed a cyberattack against Sony Pictures aimed at blocking the release of a satirical film deemed disrespectful of its leader, Kim Jong-un.   Mr. Wallace said it was imperative for Britain to reinforce its efforts to defend against future attacks. ''It's a salient lesson for us all that all of us, from individuals to governments to large organizations, have a role to play in maintaining the security of our networks,'' he said.   The National Audit Office said on Friday that the WannaCry attack had been relatively unsophisticated and could have been prevented had the N.H.S. followed rudimentary procedures to protect its systems. It said that N.H.S. management had recklessly ignored security recommendations.   Amyas Morse, the head of the National Audit Office, on Friday criticized the preparedness of the N.H.S.   ''The WannaCry cyberattack had potentially serious implications for the N.H.S. and its ability to provide care to patients,'' he said in a statement. He added that the N.H.S. needed to get its ''act together.''   In the immediate aftermath, Amber Rudd, the British home secretary, acknowledged that, despite several warnings of a possible attack, the N.H.S. had been ill prepared to defend itself and was vulnerable because its computers had outmoded software.   While the ransom demanded in the attack in Britain was modest, the National Audit Office said evidence indicated that no N.H.S. organization had paid, which experts say could have encouraged further attacks.

"North Carolina County Refuses to Pay $23,000 Ransom to Hackers","In a world rocked by hackers, trolls and online evildoers of all stripes, the good people of the internet have long looked for a hero who would refuse to back down. Finally, someone has said enough is enough. And that someone is the government of Mecklenburg County, N.C.  The county, which includes the city of Charlotte, said on Wednesday that it would not pay a $23,000 ransom to a group of hackers who seized control of several government computer systems. The breach was announced on Tuesday when the county government said on Twitter that it was ""experiencing a computer-system outage."" ""I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,"" Dena R. Diorio, the Mecklenburg County manager, said in a statement on Wednesday. ""It will take time, but with patience and hard work, all of our systems will be back up and running as soon as possible."" Mecklenburg is the most populous county in North Carolina, and the attack compromised many of its systems. But on Wednesday it said it was ""open for business, albeit somewhat slower with limited access to systems."" Without the internet, civil servants were doing their jobs using ""paper processes,"" it said. Officials said they believed the hackers had not obtained the personal information of any employees or private citizens. The targeted systems included those of the tax assessor's office and the Parks and Recreation and Social Services Departments, the county said in a statement. Ransomware breaches are not uncommon. In May, tens of thousands of computers in more than 70 countries were hit by a ransomware attack that used software stolen from the National Security Agency. The next month, a second ransomware attack swept through more than 64 countries. Hackers often ask to be paid in Bitcoin, an online cryptocurrency whose value has skyrocketed over the last year, and their victims often comply. Last month, Uber said that it had paid hackers $100,000 to delete data they stole and that the company had kept the data breach secret for more than a year. A local news station in North Carolina reported on Tuesday that the hackers who targeted Mecklenburg County asked to be paid 2 Bitcoins, or $23,000. When a Twitter user quipped that Bitcoin had ""really gone up"" lately, Ms. Diorio responded, ""Indeed."" The hackers have not been publicly identified, and the exact threat they made to Mecklenburg County was not clear. But officials did not appear to be particularly cowed on Wednesday. Instead of paying the hackers, the county said, it will rebuild the affected systems from scratch using backed-up data. ""It was going to take almost as long to fix the system after paying the ransom as it does to fix it ourselves,"" Ms. Diorio said. ""And there was no guarantee that paying the criminals was a sure fix."" PHOTO: Dena R.

How to Protect Yourself From Ransomware Attacks,"Email: brian.chen@nytimes.com; Twitter: @bxchen A decade-old form of malicious software known as ransomware has been making headlines after cybercriminals hijacked hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide. Ransomware, which is often transmitted by email or web pop-ups, involves locking up people's data and threatening to destroy it if a ransom is not paid. The global cyberattack has affected 200,000 Windows computers in more than 150 countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, Germany and Britain.    The cybercriminals have generally targeted hospitals, academic institutions, blue-chip companies and businesses like movie theater chains. The attacks highlight the challenges that organizations face with consistently applying security safeguards on a large scale.    ''Not only individuals, but even governments and big companies with so much to lose fail to secure their systems and train their employees about necessary security practices,'' said Marty P. Kamden, a marketing executive for the private network service provider NordVPN. ''Cautious online behavior would probably have prevented the malware from infecting the network in the first place.''   What can businesses and individuals do to protect themselves from ransomware? Here are some tips from security experts.   Update your software   Security experts believe the malware that spurred this global attack, called WannaCry, may have initially infected machines by getting people to download it through email. After that, the malicious code was able to easily travel to a broader network of computers that were linked together through the Windows file-sharing system. (Users of Macs or other non-Windows computers were not affected.)   The most disheartening revelation from the cyberattack was that there was a fix available for the ransomware before the attack. Microsoft, which makes Windows, released a patch for the WannaCry vulnerability eight weeks ago, said Chris Wysopal, the chief technology officer of Veracode, an application security company.   In other words, if people had simply stayed on top of security updates, their machines would not have been infected. ''People kind of got complacent and not vigilant about updating their machines,'' Mr. Wysopal said.   Consumers can remedy this by configuring their Windows machines to automatically install the latest software updates.   Even though WannaCry specifically targeted Windows machines, that does not mean Mac or Linux users are off the hook in the future. Other breeds of malware may infect various operating systems, so no matter which device you are using, you should regularly update your software to install the latest security enhancements.   Install antivirus software   In addition to keeping Windows up-to-date with the latest security enhancements, antivirus software can prevent malware from infecting your computer. Mr. Kamden of NordVPN said 30 percent of popular antivirus systems were capable of detecting and neutralizing the ransomware.   Of course, with antivirus software, the same principle applies: Make sure to keep the antivirus app up-to-date, too, so it blocks the latest emerging malware. Also, download antivirus apps only from reputable vendors like Kaspersky Lab, Bitdefender or Malwarebytes, Mr. Kamden said.   Be wary of suspicious emails and pop-ups   Security experts believe WannaCry may have initially infected machines via email attachments. The lesson: Avoid clicking links inside dubious emails, Mr. Kamden said.   How do you spot a fishy email? Look carefully at the email address of the sender to see if it is coming from a legitimate address. Also, look for obvious typos and grammatical errors in the body. Hover over hyperlinks (without clicking on them) inside emails to see whether they direct you to suspicious web pages. If an email appears to have come from your bank, credit card company or internet service provider, keep in mind that they will never ask for sensitive information like your password or social security number.   In addition, ransomware developers often use pop-up windows that advertise software products that remove malware. Do not click on anything through these pop-ups, then safely close the windows.   Create backups of your data   In the event that a hacker successfully hijacks your computer, you could rescue yourself with a backup of your data stored somewhere, like on a physical hard drive. That way, if a hacker locked down your computer, you could simply erase all the data from the machine and restore it from the backup.   In general, you should be creating a copy of your data in the first place, in case your computer fails or is lost. To be extra safe from hackers, after backing up your data onto an external drive, unplug the drive from the computer and put it away.   Create a security plan for your business   For larger businesses with hundreds or thousands of employees, applying security updates organizationwide can be difficult. If one employee's machine lacks the latest security software, it can infect other machines across the company network.   Mr. Wysopal said businesses could learn from how WannaCry spread through the Windows file-sharing system by developing a strict schedule for when computers companywide should automatically install the latest software updates. Businesses should determine the best time to apply these security updates to office computers without interrupting productivity, he added.   Information technology professionals should also regularly educate and test employees on spotting suspicious emails, said Matt Ahrens, vice president of Crypsis, a cybersecurity firm.   What to do if already infected   If you are already a victim of ransomware, the first thing to do is disconnect your computer from the internet so it does not infect other machines. Then report the crime to law enforcement and seek help from a technology professional who specializes in data recovery to see what your options might be. If there are none, don't lose hope: There may be new security tools to unlock your files in the future.   In some extreme cases, it might make sense to pay a ransom if you have no backups and the encrypted files are valuable, Mr. Wysopal said. But he added that with WannaCry, people definitely should not pay the ransom. That's because the hackers are apparently overloaded with requests from victims asking for their data to be released -- and many who have paid the ransom are not hearing back.   Twitter: @bxchen.

He Won Praise for Halting a Global Cyberattack. Then He Was Arrested.,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A British security researcher, who became an internet hero after he was credited with stopping a malicious software attack this year, was arrested at the Las Vegas airport and charged in connection with a separate attack. Marcus Hutchins, the researcher, was widely praised for identifying a way to disable the WannaCry malicious software, or malware, attack that seized hundreds of thousands of computers this year. Researchers credited Mr. Hutchins's discovery of a so-called kill switch in the malware for stopping its spread and preventing the attack from infecting millions more computers.     According to an indictment filed in federal court in Milwaukee that was unsealed on Thursday, Mr. Hutchins, 23, and an unidentified accomplice conspired to create and sell malware intended to steal login information and other financial data from online banking sites.   Mr. Hutchins created the software and his accomplice offered to sell the program, known as the Kronos banking Trojan, for $3,000 on an internet forum, the indictment said. The accomplice sold a version of the Kronos malware for $2,000 in June 2015. The indictment did not include details on how widely that malware was used, or much specific evidence of Mr. Hutchins's involvement.   The Justice Department said in a statement that a federal grand jury returned a six-count indictment against Mr. Hutchins last month after a two-year investigation. It said that the Kronos malware was built to ''harvest and transfer'' user names and passwords from banking websites from an infected computer. Kronos, according to the Justice Department's statement, has been configured to strike banking systems in a number of countries, including Canada, Germany, Poland, France and the United Kingdom.   When the Kronos malware was first advertised in underground Russian forums in 2014, the asking price of $7,000 indicated that the selling of malware was a lucrative business. Kronos was promoted as a hacking tool that could retrieve data including user names and passwords, A.T.M. PINs, and personal information useful in cracking security questions.   Earlier on Thursday, Motherboard reported that Mr. Hutchins had been detained at the Las Vegas airport after a week of attending both the Black Hat and Defcon security conferences. He had been scheduled to fly back to his home in the United Kingdom.   The security community reacted with surprise and skepticism over the arrest of one of its well-regarded stars. Some warned that claims against Mr. Hutchins could strain the relationship between ''white hat'' hackers -- researchers who look for software vulnerabilities to spot problems and fix them, rather than to commit a crime or sow chaos -- and law enforcement.   Others were unconvinced that Mr. Hutchins would create such software for an attack. In July 2014, he asked on Twitter if anyone had a Kronos sample -- a seemingly odd request if he had created the malware.   While the exact circumstances of Mr. Hutchins's involvement with the Kronos malware were unclear, security researchers have often skirted legal trouble while looking for vulnerabilities in computer code. In recent years, big tech companies have created ''bug bounties'' to formalize a process for researchers to report problems and to be compensated for their work.   The Defcon conference, a freewheeling gathering of security experts from around the world, has also had a touchy relationship with law enforcement. In 2001, for example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a Russian encryption expert in his Las Vegas hotel room after he published software officials said could crack the security of some kinds of e-books.   The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization, said in a statement that it was concerned about the arrest of Mr. Hutchins and was looking into the matter.   The WannaCry ransomware infected computers running older versions of Microsoft Windows. Once spread, the software encrypted computers and locked users out of files, folders and drives. If an affected machine was connected to a network, other computers on the network could become infected as well. The attackers demanded that victims pay hundreds of dollars to a Bitcoin address.   Mr. Hutchins was something of an accidental hero. According to an interview with The Guardian in May, Mr. Hutchins said he registered a website domain after discovering that the malicious software was trying to connect to it. By registering the domain for $10.69, he triggered a so-called kill switch that halted the software's spread. His intention initially was not to stop the attack but to track its spread.   Mr. Hutchins, who works as a researcher for Kryptos Logic, a Los Angeles-based cybersecurity firm, said in the interview that he had skipped going to college and taught himself how to write software. The company did not respond to a request for comment.   Mr. Hutchins tried to remain anonymous, communicating with the media through his handle MalwareTech, but British tabloids revealed his identity. He was celebrated in the cybersecurity community for his achievement, winning a special recognition award at an SC Awards Europe industry event.     "
British Warn Of Hacking By Russians,"LONDON -- Russian hackers over the past 12 months have tried to attack the British energy, telecommunications and media industries, the government's top cybersecurity official said Tuesday in a summary of a speech to be delivered on Wednesday. The warning, by Ciaran Martin, chief of the National Cyber Security Center, is the strongest indication yet that Russian cyberattacks on Western governments and industries may be far more persistent than United States or British officials have previously acknowledged.     The speech also appeared to fit into a coordinated effort by the British government to publicly warn Russia that its efforts have been noticed. In a speech on Monday night, Prime Minister Theresa May addressed Russia directly. ''We know what you are doing,'' Mrs. May said. ''And you will not succeed.'' She accused the Kremlin of ''threatening the international order on which we all depend.''   Taken together, the two speeches are a sharp escalation in the public accusations around a conflict that has so far remained mostly in the shadows. Recent high-profile cyberattacks, however, have put new pressure on politicians to defend against the dangers.   The most spectacular example is the break into the computer systems of the American Democratic Party during the 2016 presidential campaign, an attack American intelligence agencies have attributed to Russian hackers.   But Britain this year was hit by the so-called WannaCry cyberattack, carried out by North Korea. It temporarily disabled the computer systems at several British hospitals, forcing the diversion of ambulances and the rescheduling of operations, before it was stopped by the lucky break of a lone amateur who successfully defused it.   American government officials also reportedly concluded over the summer that Russia had penetrated the computer networks of companies that operate nuclear power stations and other energy facilities, evidently gathering information and probing for vulnerabilities. No operations were disrupted.   The Russians also reportedly tried to break into the Irish electrical grid last summer, and British officials warned at the time that they appeared to be singling out British power companies as well. Russian hackers have successfully shut down power for a time in parts of  Ukraine, which the Russians appear to treat as laboratory for testing such tactics.   British and American intelligence officials say the Kremlin has deliberately cultivated a cottage industry of criminal hackers loosely affiliated with Russian intelligence agencies. Russian intelligence officials sometimes personally profit from the revenue from cybercrimes, and at other times they direct the hackers toward sabotage, espionage or other less lucrative objectives.   Among other victories, the Russians appear to have collaborated with a group calling itself Shadow Brokers to release a trove of cyberespionage tactics stolen from the computers of the National Security Agency, including some incorporated in the WannaCry virus that have now been used against Western industries and governments.   The summary released Tuesday of Mr. Martin's speech provided no details of the specific Russian attacks over the last year on British energy, telecommunications or media companies. Nor did the statement discuss any possible Russian efforts to use social media or cyberespionage to influence elections in Britain, as the Kremlin has recently sought to do in the United States and France.   But Mr. Martin said that fears of Russian election meddling have grown increasingly widespread throughout Europe. At a conference organized last month by the National Cyber Security Center, he said, two-thirds of the member states of the European Union were concerned about potential Russian interference in their internal elections.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
The Health Data Conundrum; Op-Ed Contributors,"THERE'S quite a paradox when it comes to our health data. Most of us still cannot readily look at it, but there's been an epidemic of cybercriminals and thieves hacking and stealing this most personal information. Last year hundreds of breaches involving millions of health records were reported to the Department of Health and Human Services - with the hackingsofthe health insurers Anthem and Premera Blue Cross alone affecting some 90 million Americans. At least 10 hospitals and health care systems have had their patient data and information systems literally heldforransom. This month, the national medical lab Quest Diagnostics reported that information on 34,000 patients had been stolen. And these breaches are just the ones that have been disclosed.  Why is our private health information being stolen and trafficked by cybercriminals? For one, these records include information that makes them more valuable to hackers than almost any other type of data. Thieves can use this information to order medical equipment and drugs to resell and to fraudulently bill insurance companies, the costs of which are passed along to consumers. Second, while our personal medical data is so precious and valuable to us, it's an exceptionally easy target for criminals. The health care industry's focus has been on patient care rather than cybersecurity, and federal regulations intended to protect financial data do not apply to health care records. It is common for millions of patients' health records to be stored together in huge central databases that, once breached, yield a trove of information. It has become increasingly difficult to combat this problem using traditional methods of enforcement and deterrence. Even assuming the wrongdoers are identified, there are often jurisdictional hurdles because the thieves aren't in the United States or in countries that will easily extradite them. Moreover, companies that are hacked are restrained in their desire for the criminals to be prosecuted because that means their own embarrassing breach will be in the news that much longer. In April 2014, the F.B.I. issued an alert that these sorts of attacks would only increase as providers moved from paper to electronic records. A recent theft involving Anthem is a perfect illustration. Tens of millions of patient records were compromised, all were stored in a centralized database, none were encrypted, and no one has been caught. Anthem's response was to send out letters to victims offering free credit monitoring. But credit monitoring isn't an antidote for a breach of medical records. What good does a form letter do for someone whose most private data has just been stolen? What's the solution? For starters, disaggregation, meaning that medical data should be stored in individual or family units rather than in centralized databases. Such a regime would return the data to the person who should own it in the first place: the patient. Each individual or family would have medical data in a personal cloud or a digital wallet. Patients could then share their data how they choose: with family members, with researchers, with other doctors for a second opinion. We cannot leave it to the health record software companies - the Cerners, Epics and Allscripts of the world - to bring about the needed changes. Their business is to sell proprietary information software to health systems to create large centralized databases for such things as insurance reimbursements and patient care. Their success has relied on an old, paternalistic model in medicine in which the data is generated and owned by doctors and hospitals. Yes, giving consumers control of their own medical data would revolutionize who owns medical data and how it is used. Concerns about researchers losing access to this amassed data are overstated. Patients have shown an overwhelming willingness to share their information for altruistic reasons (which far exceeds the track record of doctors and health systems when it comes to sharing data). The private and academic sectors are hard at work on a technology solution: one that is tamper-proof, ensures confidentiality and makes sharing medical data easy. One approach, known as a blockchain, is an encrypted data platform that would give patients digital wallets containing all their medical data, continually updated, that they can share at will. We need to move on from the days of health systems storing and owning all our health data. Patients should be the owners of their own medical data. It's an entitlement and civil right that should be recognized. Kathryn Haun is a federal prosecutor who teaches a course on cybercrime at Stanford Law School. Her views are her own. Eric J. Topol, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute, is the author of ""The Patient Will See You Now.""  "
Keeping Your Files Safe in Google's Cloud,"Q.  When I upload a file to the Google Drive cloud, where is it actually stored, and is it protected from hackers? A. According to Google, the files you add to your Google Drive app or folder are stored on servers in secure data centers. Your data stored with Google is encrypted during transfer from your computer -- and while it sits on Google Drive servers. (Many online file-storage sites offer similar protection, but check before you sign up if you have security concerns.)     Cloud services are often targets for thieves, but personal security by the account holder is often the weak link. Google recommends using two-step verification on Google Drive accounts to add an extra layer of protection, and it says to always fully log out of your account when using shared or public computers. The Safety Center area of the company's website has other tips and tools for many of its products, including Gmail, Android and Chrome.   In addition to providing a place to store files, Google Drive includes Google Docs, an online software suite for creating and collaborating on documents, spreadsheets and presentations. This summer, the company announced a desktop app for Windows and Mac, called Backup and Sync, that keeps Google Photos and Google Drive files backed up online.   Google Drive has been around since 2012, and some people have raised concerns about Google's scanning user content for its own purposes, like selling targeted advertising. The company's overall Terms of Service document states, ''Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received and when it is stored.''   Google's terms are not unlike those of other companies offering similar services and can be seen as the price of ''free.'' If they bother you, you can look for a different service with more agreeable terms or encrypt the stored data yourself.

"Daily Report: A Crusader Against a Severe, Previously Unseen Cyberattack","Just when you think that cybersecurity hacking cannot grow worse, it does. Golan Ben-Oni found this out firsthand. Mr. Ben-Oni is the global chief information officer of IDT Corporation, a conglomerate in Newark, that was subjected in April to an attack using cyberweapons that had been stolen from the National Security Agency. It was like nothing he had ever seen.     The hackers locked up IDT data and demanded a ransom. That's similar to  WannaCry, a ransomware attack that struck hospitals and other organizations across the world in May. But the hacking that Mr. Ben-Oni experienced went a step further: The ransom demand was a smoke screen for a more invasive attack to steal employee credentials, information that would have allowed the hackers to roam freely through IDT's systems.   All of this is chronicled in a gripping tale about Mr. Ben-Oni's predicament by Nicole Perlroth, a technology reporter for The New York Times, who reported the previously unseen attack for the first time. Mr. Ben-Oni has continued to hunt for the intruders.   The worst news? He's convinced that many other computer systems around the globe have been hit by the same kind of attack he saw. It's just that the attacks weren't detected or understood -- which increases the risk.   ''You can't catch it, and it's happening right under our noses,'' Mr. Ben-Oni told Ms. Perlroth. ''The world isn't ready for this.''     "
"Britain's Health Service, Targeted in Cyberattack, Ignored Warnings For Months","LONDON -- Britain's National Health Service ignored numerous warnings over the last year that many of its computer systems were outdated and unprotected from the type of devastating cyberattack it suffered on Friday. The attack caused some hospitals to stop accepting patients, doctor's offices to shut down, emergency rooms to divert patients, and critical operations to be canceled as a decentralized system struggled to cope.    At some hospitals, nurses could not even print out name tags for newborn babies. At the Royal London Hospital, in east London, George Popescu, a 23-year-old hotel cook, showed up with a forehead injury. ''My head is pounding and they say they can't see me,'' he said. ''They said their computers weren't working. You don't expect this in a big city like London.''   In a statement on Friday, the N.H.S. said its inquiry into the attack was in its early phases but that ''at this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed.''    Many of the N.H.S. computers still run Windows XP, an out-of-date software that no longer gets security updates from its maker, Microsoft. A government contract with Microsoft to update the software for the N.H.S. expired two years ago.   Microsoft discontinued the security updates for Windows XP in 2014. It made a patch, or fix, available in newer versions of Windows for the flaws that were exploited in Friday's cyberattacks. But the health service does not seem to have installed either the newer version of Windows or the patch.   ''Historically, we've known that N.H.S. uses computers running old versions of Windows that Microsoft itself no longer supports and says is a security risk,'' said Graham Cluley, a cybersecurity expert in Oxford, England. ''And even on the newest computers, they would have needed to apply the patch released in March. Clearly that did not happen, or the malware wouldn't have spread this fast.''   Just this month, a parliamentary research briefing noted that cyberattacks were viewed as one of the top threats facing Britain. The push to make medical records systems more interconnected might also make the system more vulnerable to attack. Britain plans to digitize all patient records by 2020.   Several news reports have addressed the outdated systems of the N.H.S. that potentially left confidential patient data vulnerable to attack. Last November, Sky News did an investigation showing that units of the N.H.S., serving more than two million people, spent nothing on cybersecurity in 2015. Jennifer Arcuri, of Hacker House, which worked with Sky on the report, said then: ''I would have to say that the security across the board was weak for many factors.''   On Friday, Ms. Arcuri said on Twitter: ''We told every (one) back in Nov this would happen! @myhackerhouse identified NHS trusts putting patient data at risk.''   The N.H.S., founded after World War II, employs 1.6 million people with a combined budget of £140 billion, making it one of the largest employers in the world.   But its budget is always under pressure and the Conservatives, while increasing funding, have been sharply criticized by opposition parties for not devoting enough resources for new, more expensive treatments and to cope with an aging population.   As the attack unfolded on Friday, N.H.S. officials struggled to get a handle on the problem, but urged patients who had emergencies to go to hospitals or seek care as they normally would.   At St. Bartholomew's, a sprawling hospital in London's financial center, nonessential appointments and surgeries were canceled. Some ambulances were diverted to other hospitals.   One surgical resident, who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to journalists, said he was in the middle of a heart operation around lunchtime when several computers suddenly flickered off, although monitoring equipment remained operational. He said his group was able to safely perform surgery.   He said the hospital had canceled any noncritical operations because of the difficulty of getting into patient medical records, but that patient safety was not at risk.   Esther Rainbow, a manager of cardiac services at the Barts unit of the N.H.S. in London, said in an interview that in coping with the attack, the hospitals had to use older systems involving patient notes on paper. ''Pretty much everything now is electronic,'' she said. ''Each patient has a folder of notes, but we're doing that less and less. So had to revert back to the older paper note system.''   Prescriptions for pharmacies, which are normally ordered online, had to be written on paper, too, she said.   The hospitals also struggled with some heart scanning machines that feed into the computer network, and had to shut those down, she said.   ''For us the main issue has been getting information,'' she said. ''At Barts, we were told not to use our work mobiles and to turn off all Wi-Fi. Later in the day we were told to unplug everything from the network. The main impact in terms of the diagnostics was that we had no idea who was turning up and which patient was seeing which unit.''   ''As the day went on it felt a little bit more scary,'' Ms. Rainbow added, ''as we were told to shut things down and unplug things. We also don't know what other patients are due to come in. There may be a knock-on effect for Monday and Tuesday.''   Friday's attack was caused by ransomware, a kind of malware that encrypts data, locks out the user and demands a ransom to release it. A unit of the N.H.S. in Lincolnshire was hit by another kind of ransomware attack in October, shutting down operations for four days.   A doctor, Krishna Chinthapalli, published an article just two days ago in the British Medical Journal warning about this phenomenon.   He cites a report that 1 in 3 N.H.S. trusts -- the entities that focus on geographic areas or specialties like mental health or ambulance services -- reported a ransomware attack in 2016.   Reuters reported that N.H.S. employees were warned about the ransomware threat earlier on Friday.   Dr. Emma Fardon, a doctor in Dundee, told the BBC that she came back from house visits around 1 p.m. ''to find all our computers hit by the virus,'' and so was unable to access patient records or issue prescriptions.   ''Everything is fully computerized,'' she said. ''We have no idea what drugs people are on or the allergies they have. We can't access the appointments system. We've had to try and phone as many people to rearrange their appointments to next week.''   She added: ''We're trying to accommodate who we can. We are still seeing people who really need it.''     "
New Role for Russia: Cyberattack Victim,"MOSCOW -- Russia was again at the center of a global hacking scandal when computer systems the world over were frozen this weekend by a variant of malicious software known as WannaCry. But this time, Russians were among the victims of the attack, not suspected of being the perpetrators. In fact, of all the countries afflicted in the first wave of the spread of the malicious software, Russia was hit the hardest: The virus tried to infect more computers in Russia than anywhere else, according to an analysis by Kaspersky Lab, a Russian antivirus company.     While government computers were crashing, banks, cellphone operators and railroads in Russia were fending off attacks designed to freeze their systems in demand for ransoms to unlock the data.   Now on the business end of a cyberattack, Russian officials were quick to voice outrage.   ''Humanity is dealing here with cyberterrorism,'' said Frants Klintsevich, the deputy chairman of the Russian Senate's defense committee, according to the state-run Tass news agency. ''It's an alarming signal, and not just a signal but a direct threat to the normal functioning of society, and important life-support systems.''   Computer researchers have yet to determine the origin of the ''ransomware'' attack, but Mr. Klintsevich said the hackers' intended targets were global.   ''I cannot exclude that the main task consists now of frightening the whole world,'' he said. ''The attacks hit hospitals, railroad transport and police. Over these days, the world got a serious warning.''   The malicious software, or malware, was apparently stolen from the National Security Agency's arsenal of cyberweapons and put to use by unknown hackers. It began proliferating quickly on Friday, and by Sunday, the attack had afflicted 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries, according to Europol, the European Union's police agency.   The attack was among the highest-profile computer intrusions since security experts and American intelligence agencies accused hackers acting on behalf of the Russian government of trying to influence the outcome of the 2016 American presidential election and the recent presidential election in France.   Russian officials deny that they were involved in breaching servers of the Democratic National Committee or of other political operatives in an effort to help elect Donald J. Trump last year. And they have denied culpability for efforts this month to expose private data stolen from the campaign of Emmanuel Macron in France.   Hacking -- far from an exclusive trick of the Russians -- is a global scourge, Russian officials have said, and the ransomware attack became a painful illustration of their point.   The malware was based on a program developed by the N.S.A. and stolen in a breach of the United States government's servers. The version of the program used to demand ransoms from the operators of frozen computer systems exploits vulnerabilities in older and unlicensed versions of Microsoft Windows, used widely in Russia, that did not have security patches.   On Friday, Russia's Interior Ministry reported attacks on about 1,000 computers using the Windows operating system, but said the computers had been isolated from ministry networks.   A spokeswoman for the ministry, Irina Volk, told Russian news agencies that key servers had been unaffected because they were running domestic software, including a little-known operating system called Elbrus, first developed in the late Soviet period.   Russian cybercriminals were among the pioneers of ransomware, although there is no evidence linking them to the latest WannaCry attack.   In recent years, a prominent Russian malware system called Gameover Zeus, which had been used for bank thefts and government espionage, also distributed a particularly ruthless ransomware program called Cryptolocker.   In December, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on the Russian hacker associated with Gameover Zeus, Evgeniy M. Bogachev, who is also wanted by the F.B.I. in connection with cybercrimes including bank fraud, money laundering and identity theft.   Mikhail Delyagin, the director of the Institute of Problems of Globalization in Russia, said he suspected the United States government was behind the WannaCry attack, saying it could be the retaliation the Americans threatened against Russia for its hacking efforts last year.   ''I respect the honesty of the United States,'' he said. ''They threaten us with a cyberattack, and a cyberattack follows. It's logical.''   Still, prominent Russian computer researchers have refrained from blaming the United States, although the malicious software originated with the N.S.A.   ''Special state cyberforces evidently would not exercise such a stupid attack,'' Igor Ashmanov, a member of the Council for Digital Economy, a government advisory body, said in an interview. Any government-backed attack on Russian institutions would be considered an act of war, he said.   And this time, he said, ''of course it wasn't Russian hackers,'' given that Russia appeared to be a main target.     "
Hackers Post New HBO Files And Demand a Hefty Ransom,"Hackers using the name ''Mr. Smith'' posted a fresh cache on Monday of stolen HBO files online, and demanded that the network pay a ransom of several million dollars to prevent further such releases.  The data dump included what appear to be scripts from five ''Game of Thrones'' episodes, including one coming episode, and a month's worth of email from the account of Leslie Cohen, HBO's vice president for film programming. There were also internal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives.    HBO, which previously acknowledged the theft of ''proprietary information,'' said it was continuing to investigate and was working with the police and security experts. The network said on Monday that it still did not believe that its email system as a whole had been compromised.   This is the second data release from the hack. So far, the leaks at HBO have been limited, falling well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In that attack, hackers unearthed thousands of embarrassing emails and released personal information, including salaries and Social Security numbers, of nearly 50,000 current and former Sony employees. In the aftermath of the attack, the Sony Pictures chief, Amy Pascal, was ousted.   Those behind the HBO theft claim to have more data, including scripts, coming episodes of HBO shows and movies, and information damaging to HBO.   ''Game of Thrones,'' currently in its penultimate season, is the most popular show in HBO's history and has long been a target of digital piracy.   In a video directed to HBO's chief executive, Richard Plepler, ''Mr. Smith'' used white text on a black background to threaten further disclosures if HBO did not pay the ransom. To stop the leaks, the hackers demanded ''our 6 month salary in bitcoin,'' which they implied is at least $6 million.     "
Trump Is President. Encrypt Your Email.,"Max Read (@max_read) is the editor of Select All, New York magazine's technology site. In the weeks after Donald J. Trump won the election, a schism threatened to break my group of friends in two. Not a political argument brought about by the president-elect, or a philosophical fight over the future of the country, but a question of which app we should be using to chat: GroupMe or Signal? On the one hand, GroupMe, a popular group-messaging app, had cartoons we could add to our conversations, and we'd been using it for years. On the other, Signal offered secure, encrypted communication, and we were facing the first term of a president who has said Edward J. Snowden should be executed, demanded a boycott of Apple when the company refused to crack the iPhone of the San Bernardino, Calif., gunman for the F.B.I., and openly admired the ''power'' of the hackers who leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee. Sure, we were mostly plotting bars to meet at, not targets for terrorist attacks. But given the incoming administration's professed attitude, a little extra security couldn't hurt. Then again: GroupMe's cartoons were really fun.     We weren't the only people asking ourselves this kind of question. In the months since the hacking of the Democrats and Mr. Trump's election, information security has become a concern to a much larger group of people than the professionals, activists, journalists and paranoiacs you'd expect. (Even stalwart Trump supporters on Reddit and in the comments on Breitbart are expressing apprehension about a congressional vote on Tuesday that rolled back Obama-era privacy regulations governing the collection of user data by internet service providers.) Nowhere is this more clear than in consumer apps and services for secure communications.   Though it's still not challenging Facebook Messenger atop the most-downloaded rankings, Signal, an open-source secure-messaging service produced by Open Whisper Systems, had a 400 percent increase in downloads in the days after the election, an incredible spike for an app developed by a small team funded by grants and donations. ''Millions of people used Signal before the election,'' Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper, told me recently, ''but there has never before been a single event that resulted in such a dramatic and sustained day-over-day increase in new Signal users.''   Signal isn't alone in its newfound popularity. ProtonMail, a -respected secure-email start-up based in Switzerland (a country with particularly strict privacy laws), has seen a sustained boost of new email sign-ups ''in the ballpark of a 100 percent increase compared to before Trump,'' according to Andy Yen, the chief executive of ProtonMail's parent company. ''Trump, and the U.S. election as a whole, was clearly a catalyst that brought the issue of email privacy to the forefront globally.''   Eight years of a broadly likable president lulled liberals into information-security complacency, even as Barack Obama expanded the executive branch's surveillance powers -- and made heavy use of them at home and abroad. We should have been paying closer attention to how much of our data and our communications were exposed to the government, especially after the Snowden leaks revealed the scale and extent of the National Security Agency's surveillance. After those same leaks revealed the involvement of major private technology companies in government spying efforts, we should have been more careful in our use of them.   But the technology was so new -- in 2008, the iPhone was a year old and Gmail was still in beta -- that by the end of Mr. Obama's second term, Americans were only just coming to terms with the consequences of having indiscriminately turned over the basic functions and intimate details of our lives to a handful of powerful corporations. And besides, the president just seemed like a good guy.   Mr. Obama's judicious persona, which made rationalizing away his intelligence agencies' mass-surveillance programs easy, has now been replaced with the plainly vindictive and paranoid character of President Trump, who has inherited his predecessor's well-oiled security apparatus unencumbered by restraint, nuance or even a professed respect for civil liberties.   This is more than a philosophical concern about the hypothetical violation of privacy rights; it's a practical one, and not just for groups who have specific fears of federal intrusion -- undocumented immigrants, say, who want to communicate with family or lawyers away from the predatory gaze of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or journalists seeking to protect confidential sources.   As lawyers and civil libertarians point out, federal criminal law is so vast and complicated that it is easy to unwittingly violate it, and even innocent conversation can later be used to build a criminal case. Encrypting your communication isn't a matter of hiding criminal activity; it's a matter of ensuring innocuous activity can't be deemed suspicious by a zealous prosecutor or intelligence agent. Telling a friend that a party is really going to ''blow up'' when you arrive is less funny when it's being entered into evidence against you.   Even so, for many of the people now signing up for Signal or setting up encrypted email accounts, fears of an aggressive federal government are relatively minor concerns. In some sense, as the Signal skeptics in my group of friends pointed out, people are taking part in a kind of security-state LARPing -- taking up security practices the way live-action role players take up plastic swords in the park.   But the federal government isn't the only security threat on the internet. And for most people it's far from the most worrying. Social media is infested with roving bands of malicious hackers, far less concerned with intercepting communications for surveillance purposes than with wreaking havoc and embarrassing targets.   The hacks that exposed tens of thousands of emails from the accounts of the Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta, and Democratic Party staff members were as loud an alarm as Mr. Trump's election. When libraries of correspondence are dumped online unedited, they're invitations to be picked apart, taken out of context and turned into the building blocks of bizarre and damaging pizza-based conspiracy theories. While the fantasy of oppressive government surveillance is appealing to the little Winston Smiths inside us -- and is much more than a fantasy for many activists and journalists -- practically, what most of us should fear isn't Big Brother reading our emails, but everyone else.   There's another reason to use encrypted email or messaging besides fear, anyway: herd immunity. The more widely the use of encrypted communication spreads, the less useful the dragnet tools of the intelligence community become. C.I.A. documents published by WikiLeaks last month seem to confirm this: Unable to crack Signal's encryption for bulk collection, the agency must instead attempt the practically difficult task of installing malware on specific phones. ''Ubiquitous e2e encryption is pushing intelligence agencies from undetectable mass surveillance to expensive, high-risk, targeted attacks,'' Open Whisper Systems tweeted after the leak, discussing the benefits of end-to-end encryption.   But even if we're overly paranoid -- even if there's nothing to fear from either the feds or random alt-right trouble makers -- what's wrong with security LARPing? Often without realizing it, Americans have exposed vast and previously private information about ourselves to enormous tech companies, the government and, in all likelihood, malicious actors looking to mess around. If a President Trump is what it takes for liberals to think more clearly about the security of our data and communications, so be it. At worst, security LARPing -- like using Signal when GroupMe would do -- is an exercise in mindfulness: a daily check on your exposure. At best, it'll actually prevent a security breach.   In the end, my friends and I split the difference, based on our particular threat model: We upgraded our subscription to the workplace chat software Slack. Slack doesn't have end-to-end encryption, so our messages could theoretically be intercepted, but it does include the security features we wanted most (two-factor authentication and automatic message deletion) and a handful of others we found useful (side chats dedicated to discussing various science-fiction and fantasy franchises). But we were far from the only people reconsidering our messaging choices.   These days, when I open Signal, my contact list is filled with dozens of friends, many of whom aren't the journalists or activists who make up the app's theoretical core user base. A few weeks ago, I asked one why he uses Signal. ''Ya gotta these days,'' he wrote back. ''And my weed guy uses it. It's why I downloaded it.''

Russia Fills Dossiers From Hacker's Trove,"To the F.B.I., Evgeniy M. Bogachev is the most wanted cybercriminal in the world. The bureau has announced a $3 million bounty for his capture, the most ever for computer crimes, and has been trying to track his movements in hopes of grabbing him if he strays outside his home turf in Russia. He has been indicted in the United States, accused of creating a sprawling network of virus-infected computers to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars from bank accounts around the world, targeting anyone with enough money worth stealing -- from a pest control company in North Carolina to a police department in Massachusetts to a Native American tribe in Washington.    In December, the Obama administration announced sanctions against Mr. Bogachev and five others in response to intelligence agencies' conclusions that Russia had meddled in the presidential election. Publicly, law enforcement officials said it was his criminal exploits that landed Mr. Bogachev on the sanctions list, not any specific role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee.    But it is clear that for Russia, he is more than just a criminal. At one point, Mr. Bogachev had control over as many as a million computers in multiple countries, with possible access to everything from family vacation photographs and term papers to business proposals and highly confidential personal information. It is almost certain that computers belonging to government officials and contractors in a number of countries were among the infected devices. For Russia's surveillance-obsessed intelligence community, Mr. Bogachev's exploits may have created an irresistible opportunity for espionage.   While Mr. Bogachev was draining bank accounts, it appears that the Russian authorities were looking over his shoulder, searching the same computers for files and emails. In effect, they were grafting an intelligence operation onto a far-reaching cybercriminal scheme, sparing themselves the hard work of hacking into the computers themselves, officials said.   The Russians were particularly interested, it seems, in information from military and intelligence services regarding fighting in eastern Ukraine and the war in Syria, according to law enforcement officials and the cybersecurity firm Fox-IT. But there also appear to have been attempts to gain access to sensitive military and intelligence information on infected computers in the United States, often consisting of searches for documents containing the words ''top secret'' or ''Department of Defense.''   The Russian government has plenty of its own cyberspace tools for gathering intelligence. But the piggybacking on Mr. Bogachev's activities offers some clues to the breadth and creativity of Russia's espionage efforts at a time when the United States and Europe are scrambling to counter increasingly sophisticated attacks capable of destroying critical infrastructure, disrupting bank operations, stealing government secrets and undermining democratic elections.   This relationship is illustrated by the improbable mix of characters targeted with the sanctions announced by the Obama administration. Four were senior officers with Russia's powerful military intelligence agency, the G.R.U. Two were suspected cyberthieves on the F.B.I.'s most wanted list: an ethnic Russian from Latvia named Alexsey Belan with a red-tinted Justin Bieber haircut, and Mr. Bogachev, whose F.B.I. file includes a photograph of him holding his spotted Bengal cat while wearing a matching set of leopard-print pajamas.   From Thief to Russian Asset?   His involvement with Russian intelligence may help explain why Mr. Bogachev, 33, is hardly a man on the run. F.B.I. officials say he lives openly in Anapa, a run-down resort town on the Black Sea in southern Russia. He has a large apartment near the shore and possibly another in Moscow, officials say, as well as a collection of luxury cars, though he seems to favor driving his Jeep Grand Cherokee. American investigators say he enjoys sailing and owns a yacht.   Running the criminal scheme was hard work. Mr. Bogachev often complained of being exhausted and ''of having too little time for his family,'' said Aleksandr Panin, a Russian hacker, now in a federal prison in Kentucky for bank fraud, who used to communicate with Mr. Bogachev online. ''He mentioned a wife and two kids as far as I remember,'' Mr. Panin wrote in an email.   Beyond that, little is known about Mr. Bogachev, who preferred to operate anonymously behind various screen names: slavik, lucky12345, pollingsoon. Even close business associates never met him in person or knew his real name.   ''He was very, very paranoid,'' said J. Keith Mularski, an F.B.I. supervisor in Pittsburgh whose investigation of Mr. Bogachev led to an indictment in 2014. ''He didn't trust anybody.''   Russia does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, and Russian officials say that so long as Mr. Bogachev has not committed a crime on Russian territory, there are no grounds to arrest him.   Attempts to reach Mr. Bogachev for this article were unsuccessful. In response to questions, his lawyer in Anapa, Aleksei Stotskii, said, ''The fact that he is wanted by the F.B.I. prevents me morally from saying anything.''   A line in Mr. Bogachev's file with the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, which has helped the F.B.I. track his movements, describes him as ''working under the supervision of a special unit of the F.S.B.,'' referring to the Federal Security Service, Russia's main intelligence agency. The F.S.B. did not respond to a request for comment.   That Mr. Bogachev remains at large ''is the most powerful argument'' that he is an asset of the Russian government, said Austin Berglas, who was an assistant special agent in charge of cyberinvestigations out of the F.B.I.'s New York field office until 2015. Hackers like Mr. Bogachev are ''moonlighters,'' Mr. Berglas said, ''doing the bidding of Russian intelligence services, whether economic espionage or straight-up espionage.''   Such an arrangement offers the Kremlin a convenient cover story and an easy opportunity to take a peek into the extensive networks of computers infected by Russian hackers, security experts say. Russian intelligence agencies also appear to occasionally employ malware tools developed for criminal purposes, including the popular BlackEnergy, to attack the computers of enemy governments. The recent revelations by WikiLeaks about C.I.A. spying tools suggest that the agency also kept a large reference library of hacking kits, some of which appear to have been produced by Russia.   It also hints at a struggle to recruit top talent. A job with the Russian intelligence agencies does not command the prestige it did in the Soviet era. The Russian state has to compete against the dream of six-figure salaries and stock options in Silicon Valley. A recruiting pitch from a few years ago for the Defense Ministry's cyberwarfare brigade offered college graduates the rank of lieutenant and a bed in a room with four other people.   And so the Kremlin at times turns to the ''dark web'' or Russian-language forums devoted to cyberfraud and spam. Mr. Bogachev, according to court papers from his criminal case, used to sell malicious software on a site called Carding World, where thieves buy and sell stolen credit card numbers and hacking kits, according to the F.B.I. One recent posting offered to sell American credit card information with CVV security numbers for $5. A user named MrRaiX was selling a malware supposedly designed to pilfer passwords from programs like Google Chrome and Outlook Express.   Rather than shut down such sites, as the F.B.I. typically tries to do, Russian intelligence agents appear to have infiltrated them, security experts say.   Some of the forums state specifically that almost any type of criminality is allowed -- bank fraud, counterfeiting documents, weapons sales. One of the few rules: no work in Russia or the former Soviet Union. In Carding World, and in many other forums, a violation results in a lifetime ban.   The F.B.I. has long been stymied in its efforts to get Russian cybercriminals. For a time, the bureau had high hopes that its agents and Russian investigators with the F.S.B. would work together to target Russian thieves who had made a specialty of stealing Americans' credit card information and breaking into their bank accounts. ''Here's to great investigations,'' F.B.I. and F.S.B. agents would toast each other at Manhattan steakhouses during periodic trust-building visits, Mr. Berglas said.   But help rarely seemed to materialize. After a while, agents began to worry that the Russian authorities were recruiting the very suspects that the F.B.I. was pursuing. The joke among Justice Department officials was the Russians were more likely to pin a medal on a suspected criminal hacker than help the F.B.I. nab him.   ''Almost all the hackers who have been announced by the U.S. government through indictments are immediately tracked by the Russian government,'' said Arkady Bukh, a New York-based lawyer who often represents Russian hackers arrested in the United States. ''All the time they're asked to provide logistical and technical support.''   While it was a widely held suspicion, it is tough to prove the connection between cyberthieves and Russian intelligence. But in one case, Mr. Berglas said, F.B.I. agents monitoring an infected computer were surprised to see a hacker who was the target of their investigation share a copy of his passport with a person the F.B.I. believed to be a Russian intelligence agent -- a likely signal that the suspect was being recruited or protected. ''That was the closest we ever came,'' he said.   Fishing for Top Secrets   Mr. Bogachev's hacking career began well over a decade ago, leading to the creation of a malicious software program called GameOver ZeuS, which he managed with the help of about a half-dozen close associates who called themselves the Business Club, according to the F.B.I. and security researchers. Working around the clock, his criminal gang infected an ever-growing network of computers. It was able to bypass the most advanced banking security measures to quickly empty accounts and transfer the money abroad through a web of intermediaries called money mules. F.B.I. officials said it was the most sophisticated online larceny scheme they had encountered -- and for years, it was impenetrable.   Mr. Bogachev became extremely wealthy. At one point, he owned two villas in France and kept a fleet of cars parked around Europe so he would never have to rent a vehicle while on vacation, according to a Ukrainian law enforcement official with knowledge of the Bogachev case, who requested anonymity to discuss the continuing investigation. Officials say he had three Russian passports with different aliases allowing him to travel undercover.   At the height of his operations, Mr. Bogachev had between 500,000 and a million computers under his control, American officials said. And there is evidence that the Russian government took an interest in knowing what was on them.   Beginning around 2011, according to an analysis by Fox-IT, computers under Mr. Bogachev's control started receiving requests for information -- not about banking transactions, but for files relating to various geopolitical developments pulled from the headlines.   Around the time that former President Barack Obama publicly agreed to start sending small arms and ammunition to Syrian rebels, in 2013, Turkish computers infected by Mr. Bogachev's network were hit with keyword searches that included the terms ''weapon delivery'' and ''arms delivery.'' There were also searches for ''Russian mercenary'' and ''Caucasian mercenary,'' suggesting concerns about Russian citizens fighting in the war.   Ahead of Russia's military intervention in Ukraine in 2014, infected computers were searched for information about top-secret files from the country's main intelligence directorate, the S.B.U. Some of the queries involved searches for personal information about government security officials, including emails from Georgia's foreign intelligence service, the Turkish Foreign Ministry and others, said Michael Sandee, one of the researchers from Fox-IT.   And at some point between March 2013 and February 2014, there were searches for English-language documents, which seemed to be fishing for American military and intelligence documents. The queries were for terms including ''top secret'' and ''Department of Defense,'' said Brett Stone-Gross, a cybersecurity analyst involved in analyzing GameOver ZeuS. ''These were in English,'' he said. ''That was different.''   Cybersecurity experts who studied the case say there is no way to know who ordered the queries. But they were so disconnected from the larceny and fraud that drove Mr. Bogachev's operation that analysts say there can be no other motive but espionage.   Whether the searches turned up any classified document or sensitive government material is unknown, although the odds are good that there were a number of federal government employees or military contractors with infected personal computers.   ''They had such a large number of infections, I would say it's highly likely they had computers belonging to U.S. government and foreign government employees,'' Mr. Stone-Gross said.   In the summer of 2014, the F.B.I., together with law enforcement agencies in over half a dozen countries, carried out Operation Tovar, a coordinated attack on Mr. Bogachev's criminal infrastructure that shut down his network and liberated computers infected with GameOver ZeuS.   Prosecutors said they were in talks with the Russian government, trying to secure cooperation for the capture of Mr. Bogachev. But the only apparent legal trouble Mr. Bogachev has faced in Russia was a lawsuit filed against him by a real estate company in 2011 over payment of about $75,000 on his apartment in Anapa, according to court papers there. And even that he managed to beat.   These days, officials believe Mr. Bogachev is living under his own name in Anapa and occasionally takes boat trips to Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia occupied in 2014. Mr. Mularski, the F.B.I. supervisor, said his agents were ''still pursuing leads.''     "
U.S. Accuses a Spammer From Russia of Wire Fraud,"Vindu Goel and Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting. Several years ago, federal agents traveled to Moscow to enlist the help of their Russian counterparts in arresting one of the world's most pernicious email spammers. They were rebuffed, a former American law enforcement official who was there said. The spammer, who used the pseudonym Peter Severa, was protected, probably by the Russian government, and could not be touched. The agents went home and waited for their target to make a mistake.    Last week he did, traveling for vacation to Barcelona, Spain, where the agents who had been following him for years were ready. Early last Friday, Spanish police burst into the hotel room where the spammer was staying with his family and arrested him. Simultaneously, cybersecurity operatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and several private companies took down his online network of tens of thousands of virus-infected computers.    On Monday, the Department of Justice unsealed court papers accusing the spammer, whose real name is Peter Levashov, of wire fraud and unauthorized interception of electronic communications. Mr. Levashov, 36, is expected to be extradited to the United States.   Officials said Mr. Levashov's arrest and the takedown of his network ended a vast criminal enterprise. For more than a decade, Mr. Levashov used his online empire to enrich himself and help others drain bank accounts and commit stock fraud, officials said. He has flooded computers with millions of spam email messages advertising counterfeit pharmaceuticals and remedies for erectile dysfunction, using subject lines like ''No amorous failure risk.''   Despite Russian news media reports to the contrary, American officials said Mr. Levashov played no role in attempts by Russian government hackers to meddle in the 2016 presidential election and support the candidacy of Donald J. Trump.   But as the Trump administration's early hopes of a rapprochement with the Kremlin have given way to increasing rancor, Mr. Levashov's arrest is certain to heighten tensions. In the past, the Kremlin deplored such arrests as tantamount to kidnapping. An advisory on the website of the Foreign Ministry accused the United States of ''hunting Russians around the world,'' and urged citizens to take precautions. Mr. Levashov was captured three months after the arrest of Stanislav Lisov, a Russian hacking suspect, also in Barcelona.   The arrests are likely to increase discord when Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson visits Moscow this week.   Government agents and cybersecurity analysts have followed Mr. Levashov since at least 2006. In that time, he has made a fortune clogging inboxes with spam using a network of computers infected with a malware known as Kelihos.   The cost of a spam campaign ranged from $200 to $500 per one million email messages, though he offered discounts of more than 50 percent for bulk orders. Mr. Levashov charged more to target American computers, an indication that these were a higher priority, court documents said.   Mr. Levashov was also known to rent his huge network of virus-infected computers to online criminals who would use it to tap bank accounts and distribute ransomware, viruses that encrypt data in an infected computer or smartphone.   At times, cybersecurity specialists said, Mr. Levashov had control of more than 100,000 computers. He has already been indicted twice in the United States on wire and computer fraud charges.   ''He was a kingpin in the criminal underground,'' said Brett Stone-Gross, a cybersecurity analyst who has tracked Mr. Levashov for years.   Despite his sprawling criminal enterprise, Mr. Levashov appears to have lived openly and lavishly in St. Petersburg, his hometown. He had a large home and bodyguards and traveled around town in an armored sedan, according to someone with knowledge of the investigation into his activities, who asked to remain anonymous because the information is confidential. His wife was said to be a high-end wedding planner sought by St. Petersburg's elite.   Though he engaged primarily in criminal exploits, Mr. Levashov appears to have occasionally dabbled in politics, suggesting collusion with the Russian government.   During Russia's 2012 presidential election, his computer network was used to spread fake news stories about one of Vladimir V. Putin's opponents, the billionaire businessman and Brooklyn Nets owner, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, saying he had come out as gay.   Text overlaid on a picture of Mr. Prokhorov said, ''Everybody who knows me knows I am a,'' followed by an anti-gay slur.   Some have speculated that Mr. Levashov also helped carry out a huge assault on Estonian government and banking computers in 2007 that is considered one of the first examples of cyberwarfare. The attack is widely believed to have been retaliation by Russia after Estonian authorities removed a World War II memorial to Soviet soldiers from its pedestal in the center of the capital, Tallinn.   Cooperation between Russian government agencies and cybercriminals is not uncommon. Russian hackers have access to the contents of millions of infected computers around the world, and there is evidence that Russian intelligence agencies piggyback on their criminal operations as a form of cheap intelligence gathering.   Last month, the Justice Department indicted two Russian intelligence agents, accusing them of working with a suspect in criminal hacking to breach Yahoo and steal account information from hundreds of millions of users.   Current and former F.B.I. agents said they have rarely, if ever, received help from Russia to arrest cybercrime suspects. More often than not, they said, the hacker is recruited to work for the government.   Sending spam is not illegal in Russia, and cybercriminals usually avoid directing more harmful attacks against computers on Russian territory.   When arrests do occur, it is because the suspect enters a country that has a collaborative law enforcement relationship with the United States.   It is not clear why Mr. Levashov would risk traveling abroad. Cybersecurity researchers had long ago guessed his true identity, and in recent years American law enforcement has stepped up arrests of criminal suspects from Russia. The Russian foreign ministry estimates that as many as three dozen Russian citizens have been arrested under similar circumstances at the behest of American authorities.   In late March, the F.B.I. received information that Mr. Levashov had left his home in St. Petersburg and traveled to Spain. American officials would not comment on how they learned of his travel plans or say whether the Russian government had cooperated.   To shut down the criminal network, specialists at the F.B.I.'s field office in Anchorage and two cybersecurity companies, CrowdStrike and Shadowserver, took advantage of a flaw in the Kelihos malware to gain access to computers controlled by Mr. Levashov and reroute them to an F.B.I. controlled server called a sinkhole.   During the operation, the F.B.I. for the first time used powers granted under amendments to what is known as Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which give broad authorization to hack into virus-infected computers. Officials said that this was done to wrest control of the computers from Mr. Levashov and that no hard drives were searched.   Mr. Levashov will remain imprisoned in Spain while American officials negotiate his extradition.   Follow Michael Schwirtz on Twitter @mschwirtz.     "
How Israel Caught Russian Hackers Scouring for American Secrets,"It was a case of spies watching spies watching spies: Israeli intelligence officers looked on in real time as Russian government hackers searched computers around the world for the code names of American intelligence programs. What gave the Russian hacking, detected more than two years ago, such global reach was its improvised search tool -- antivirus software made by a Russian company, Kaspersky Lab, that is used by 400 million people worldwide, including by officials at some two dozen American government agencies.    The Israeli officials who had hacked into Kaspersky's own network alerted the United States to the broad Russian intrusion, which has not been previously reported, leading to a decision just last month to order Kaspersky software removed from government computers.   The Russian operation, described by multiple people who have been briefed on the matter, is known to have stolen classified documents from a National Security Agency employee who had improperly stored them on his home computer, on which Kaspersky's antivirus software was installed. What additional American secrets the Russian hackers may have gleaned from multiple agencies, by turning the Kaspersky software into a sort of Google search for sensitive information, is not yet publicly known.    The current and former government officials who described the episode spoke about it on condition of anonymity because of classification rules.   Like most security software, Kaspersky Lab's products require access to everything stored on a computer in order to scour it for viruses or other dangers. Its popular antivirus software scans for signatures of malicious software, or malware, then removes or neuters it before sending a report back to Kaspersky. That procedure, routine for such software, provided a perfect tool for Russian intelligence to exploit to survey the contents of computers and retrieve whatever they found of interest.   The National Security Agency and the White House declined to comment for this article. The Israeli Embassy declined to comment, and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.   The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Russian hackers had stolen classified N.S.A. materials from a contractor using the Kaspersky software on his home computer. But the role of Israeli intelligence in uncovering that breach and the Russian hackers' use of Kaspersky software in the broader search for American secrets have not previously been disclosed.   Kaspersky Lab denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Russian hacking. ''Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,'' the company said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. Kaspersky Lab also said it ''respectfully requests any relevant, verifiable information that would enable the company to begin an investigation at the earliest opportunity.''   The Kaspersky-related breach is only the latest bad news for the security of American intelligence secrets. It does not appear to be related to a devastating leak of N.S.A. hacking tools last year to a group, still unidentified, calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which has placed many of them online. Nor is it evidently connected to a parallel leak of hacking data from the C.I.A. to WikiLeaks, which has posted classified C.I.A. documents regularly under the name Vault7.   For years, there has been speculation that Kaspersky's popular antivirus software might provide a back door for Russian intelligence. More than 60 percent, or $374 million, of the company's $633 million in annual sales come from customers in the United States and Western Europe. Among them have been nearly two dozen American government agencies -- including the State Department, the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Justice Department, Treasury Department and the Army, Navy and Air Force.   The N.S.A. bans its analysts from using Kaspersky antivirus at the agency, in large part because the agency has exploited antivirus software for its own foreign hacking operations and knows the same technique is used by its adversaries.   ''Antivirus is the ultimate back door,'' Blake Darché, a former N.S.A. operator and co-founder of Area 1 Security. ''It provides consistent, reliable and remote access that can be used for any purpose, from launching a destructive attack to conducting espionage on thousands or even millions of users.''   On Sept. 13, the Department of Homeland Security ordered all federal executive branch agencies to stop using Kaspersky products, giving agencies 90 days to remove the software. Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine C. Duke cited the ''information security risks'' presented by Kaspersky and said the company's antivirus and other software ''provide broad access to files'' and ''can be exploited by malicious cyber actors to compromise'' federal computer systems.   That directive, which some officials thought was long overdue, was based, in large part, on intelligence gleaned from Israel's 2014 intrusion into Kaspersky's corporate systems. It followed months of discussions among intelligence officials, which included a study of how Kaspersky's software works and the company's suspected ties with the Kremlin.   ''The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky,'' D.H.S. said in its statement, ''could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.''   Kaspersky Lab did not discover the Israeli intrusion into its systems until mid-2015, when a Kaspersky engineer testing a new detection tool noticed unusual activity in the company's network. The company investigated and detailed its findings in June 2015 in a public report.   The report did not name Israel as the intruder but noted that the breach bore striking similarities to a previous attack, known as ''Duqu,'' which researchers had attributed to the same nation states responsible for the infamous Stuxnet cyberweapon. Stuxnet was a joint American-Israeli operation that successfully infiltrated Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, and used malicious code to destroy a fifth of Iran's uranium centrifuges in 2010.   Kaspersky reported that its attackers had used the same algorithm and some of the same code as Duqu, but noted that in many ways it was even more sophisticated. So the company researchers named the new attack Duqu 2.0, noting that other victims of the attack were prime Israeli targets.   Among the targets Kaspersky uncovered were hotels and conference venues used for closed-door meetings by members of the United Nations Security Council to negotiate the terms of the Iran nuclear deal -- negotiations from which Israel was excluded. Several targets were in the United States, which suggested that the operation was Israel's alone, not a joint American-Israeli operation like Stuxnet.   Kaspersky's researchers noted that attackers had managed to burrow deep into the company's computers and evade detection for months. Investigators later discovered that the Israeli hackers had implanted multiple back doors into Kaspersky's systems, employing sophisticated tools to steal passwords, take screenshots, and vacuum up emails and documents.   In its June 2015 report, Kaspersky noted that its attackers seemed primarily interested in the company's work on nation-state attacks, particularly Kaspersky's work on the ''Equation Group'' -- its private industry term for the N.S.A. -- and the ''Regin'' campaign, another industry term for a hacking unit inside the United Kingdom's intelligence agency, the Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ.   Israeli intelligence officers informed the N.S.A. that in the course of their Kaspersky hack, they uncovered evidence that Russian government hackers were using Kaspersky's access to aggressively scan for American government classified programs, and pulling any findings back to Russian intelligence systems. They provided their N.S.A. counterparts with solid evidence of the Kremlin campaign in the form of screenshots and other documentation, according to the people briefed on the events.   It is not clear whether, or to what degree, Eugene V. Kaspersky, the founder of Kaspersky Lab, and other company employees have been complicit in the hacking using their products. Technical experts say that at least in theory, Russian intelligence hackers could have exploited Kaspersky's worldwide deployment of software and sensors without the company's cooperation or knowledge. Another possibility is that Russian intelligence officers might have infiltrated the company without the knowledge of its executives.   But experts on Russia say that under President Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, businesses asked for assistance by Russian spy agencies may feel they have no choice but to give it. To refuse might well invite hostile action from the government against the business or its leaders. Mr. Kaspersky, who attended an intelligence institute and served in Russia's Ministry of Defense, would have few illusions about the cost of refusing a Kremlin request.   Steven L. Hall, a former chief of Russian operations at the C.I.A., said his former agency never used Kaspersky software, but other federal agencies did. By 2013, he said, Kaspersky officials were ''trying to do damage control and convince the U.S. government that it was just another security company.''   He didn't buy it, Mr. Hall said. ''I had the gravest concerns about Kaspersky, and anyone who worked on Russia or in counterintelligence shared those concerns,'' he said.     "
Taking a Business Trip Without Giving Foreign Snoops Free Rein,"The admonitions to business travelers headed to other countries should be familiar by now: Keep your laptop with you at all times. Stay off public Wi-Fi networks. Don't send unencrypted files over the internet. But not all travelers are heeding them, and many are unaware of the foreign hackers and state-sponsored spies who are taking advantage of their lax security practices.    ''There's a difficult intersection between convenience and security,'' said Samantha Ravich, who studies cyber-enabled economic warfare at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focusing on national security. It takes more time to work abroad in the most secure way, and she said she would ''often see executives hanging their head somewhat sheepishly when I ask who in the room follows all the security protocols.''    The theft of technical product specifications, investment plans, research on mergers and acquisitions, marketing plans and other information can have consequences beyond loss of revenue and market position, Ms. Ravich told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this year. She described potential large-scale effects of state-sponsored economic warfare, which, she said, could disrupt the delivery of items crucial for manufacturing, malware incidents that could disrupt travel and cyberattacks that could force companies to shut down their websites.   The problem of intellectual property theft is not new, but it is now much more widespread. ''Placing listening devices in conference rooms, hotels and restaurants is traditional Espionage 101,'' Ms. Ravich said. But with tools like tiny inexpensive cameras and microphones or compromised Wi-Fi networks, corporate or state-sponsored industrial espionage ''can be done cheaply and at scale,'' she said.   Multiple microphones in a conference center, for instance, can be recording constantly, and those recordings can be fed into natural language processing software trained to flag certain words and report those conversations. ''It's not just a guy with headphones listening in the next room anymore,'' Ms. Ravich said.   Communicating over the internet while overseas can be especially fraught, said Nicole Miller, an independent consultant in San Francisco who helps companies communicate with employees and customers on cybersecurity issues. ''Assume any data, any information you transmit can be taken by a hacker, nation-state or another business,'' she said. ''These are not pedestrian tools they are using. They are extremely sophisticated.''   Physical security of phones, tablets and laptops is as important as cyberprotection, Ms. Miller said. ''Don't leave your laptop or papers in your hotel room when you go out,'' she said. A hotel room safe should not even be considered secure.   Ms. Miller said she advised travelers to create complex passwords for their devices and all of their online accounts, to use two-factor authentication whenever possible and to avoid plugging other people's USB drives or other external hardware into their computers.   Laptops should also be wiped clean of any data and software at the end of the trip, she said. ''Your device could have been altered, your data could have been altered,'' without your realizing it, Ms. Miller said.   Sometimes circumstances beyond travelers' control expose their information, as when customs officers in another country seize a person's device and copy its contents, she said. ''That's why any information not absolutely required for a trip should remain at the office,'' Ms. Miller said.   ''And don't tell your colleague about your great meeting while you are in the back of a taxi or in a restaurant,'' she said, because you never know who is listening. Some businesspeople at a foreign conference go so far as to wear buttons telling people not to speak out loud about their intellectual property.   Stanford University and Microsoft are among educational institutions and companies that supply comprehensive precaution and instruction lists to their employees who travel abroad.   Maureen Sharma travels regularly to Asia as part of her work for Mullally International, a small product development company in Seattle. Some unsettling incidents, she said, have made her more cautious when she travels abroad.   ''I often get more spam and strange emails that look like they are from me with attachments,'' when returning from her business trips. Once, Ms. Sharma said, she received an email that looked as if it were from a Chinese factory she was working with, asking her to send the next payment to a new bank account. ''Luckily, I called to confirm, because the factory had not sent that email,'' she said.   Ms. Sharma said she makes sure never to bring sensitive information on her laptop and changes all her passwords every time she returns home from any trip abroad.   The same risks may apply to businesspeople staying in hotels in the United States. When the Chinese company Anbang purchased the Waldorf Astoria in New York, President Barack Obama stopped having meetings there over cybersecurity concerns. Business, military and government information is being targeted for industrial espionage, said Evan Anderson, chief executive of Invnt/IP, a group dedicated to combating nation-sponsored intellectual property theft, who writes about intellectual property security for the Strategic News Service website. ''So shouldn't we take the same precautions at home as we would abroad?''   Mr. Anderson said he created a map of Chinese-owned hotels around the world in 2016 and was surprised by how many they were, including some in Silicon Valley where technology companies hold meetings. ''Most people don't realize that an individual Four Seasons hotel, Ritz-Carlton, or many other brands can be owned by a Chinese company with close ties to the Chinese government,'' he said.   Of course, listening, spying and hacking can happen no matter who owns a hotel or where a meeting is. ''The internet has no borders,'' Ms. Miller said. ''You could be hacked in another country or the U.S., and you have no idea where that person is.''   Ms. Ravich agreed. ''There is a glaring disconnect between how critical this is, and how seriously people take it,'' she said. One reason is that the theft of information, data or plans may go unnoticed, unlike the theft of a physical laptop. It is also hard to connect a cyberattack on a company to a specific trip taken by a specific employee.   Companies need to place better controls on the hardware they issue, like laptops and cellphones, Ms. Ravich said, so the devices automatically send only encrypted data, require strong passwords and use cellular connections rather than the local Wi-Fi. To really improve or ''harden'' cybersecurity for business travelers, she said, companies need to take human behavior out of the equation.     "
"How Worried Should You Be About Your Phone, Computer or TV?","WikiLeaks on Tuesday released a significant cache of documents that it said came from a high-security network inside the Central Intelligence Agency. WikiLeaks called the documents Vault 7, and they lay out the capabilities of the agency's global covert hacking program. What is the C.I.A. program?     By the end of 2016, the C.I.A. program had 5,000 registered users, including government employees and contractors. And they had produced more than a thousand hacking systems. The agency's arsenal, the documents indicate, included an array of malware ranging from viruses to clandestine ''zero day'' vulnerabilities in the software of major companies.   The files have circulated among former United States government hackers and contractors in ''an unauthorized manner, one of whom provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive,'' WikiLeaks said.   WikiLeaks said it was publishing the documents while redacting and anonymizing some passages, including the names of ''tens of thousands'' of C.I.A. targets. WikiLeaks said it was not distributing ''armed cyberweapons.''   How vulnerable is my smartphone?   The software targeted by the hacking program included the most popular smartphone operating systems: Apple's iOS and Google's Android.   The C.I.A. hacking initiative had a ''mobile devices branch,'' which developed an array of attacks on popular smartphones to infect and extract data, including a user's location, audio and text messages, and to covertly activate a phone's camera and microphone.   Apple's iPhone software, according to the documents, was a particular target, including the development of several ''zero day'' exploits -- a term for attacking coding flaws the company would not have known about.   Though Apple has only 15 percent of the global smartphone market, the intensive C.I.A. effort was probably explained by the ''popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites.''   Finding these vulnerabilities could in theory allow the spy agency to circumvent the kinds of security that stymied investigators who wanted to gain access to the password-protected iPhone of one of the attackers in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.   Google's Android, the most widely used smartphone operating system, seemed to have received even more attention. By 2016, the C.I.A. had 24 weaponized Android ''zero day'' software programs.   Did the C.I.A. directly target encryption software?   The C.I.A. focused on smartphone operating systems in large part to intercept messages before they could be encrypted, according to the WikiLeaks documents. So by targeting the phone's underlying software, the C.I.A. was looking to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Weibo and other smartphone communications applications.   Were other kinds of devices targeted?   The C.I.A. also targeted Microsoft's Windows personal computer software, other internet-connected computers, and home and industrial devices running the Linux operating system, according to the documents.   There was a specific program to penetrate and take control of Samsung smart TVs. The program, code-named Weeping Angel, was intended to convert new digital televisions into ''covert microphones.'' The malware was developed in cooperation with the British spy agency MI5, according to the documents.   The Weeping Angel program puts the target TV in a ''fake off'' mode, according to the WikiLeaks documents. Then, with the owner believing the TV is turned off, the set works as a clandestine recording device, picking up conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a C.I.A. server computer.   And in October 2014, according to the documents, the C.I.A. was exploring technology to penetrate the vehicle control systems of cars. The documents do not detail the goal of the vehicle hacking program, but WikiLeaks speculated that it would ''permit the C.I.A. to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.''   Has encryption software changed how the C.I.A. behaves?   The leaked documents indicate that the broad use of encryption has pushed the C.I.A. to become one of the world's foremost creators -- and buyers -- of malware. Much of the cache released by WikiLeaks appears to show how the agency has created or acquired a variety of tools to thwart tough encryption or intercept messages before encryption tools make them useless to the intelligence agency.   What is new about the C.I.A. program?   Using malware to hack into devices ranging from smartphones to webcams has been going on for years. Sometimes the intent is to steal information -- like names, addresses and credit-card numbers for identity theft and fraud. Sometimes the goal seems to be to create havoc.   Last year, for example, household and commercial webcams and router computers were taken over and used as launching pads to create so-called denial-of-service attacks that clogged portions of the internet and interrupted service for hours for people in parts of the United States.   But the C.I.A. program seems to have been particularly sophisticated, far-reaching and focused on surveillance. Just how innovative the individual software techniques were will not be known until independent computer security experts and scientists at the companies whose software was probed can examine the malware and tactics involved.   What time period is covered by the documents?   WikiLeaks says the document dump will cover 2013 to 2016. The organization says this is the largest publication of intelligence documents in history.   If the documents are accurate, did the C.I.A. violate commitments made by President Barack Obama?   In 2010, the Obama administration promised to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft. But the WikiLeaks documents indicate that the agency found security flaws, kept them secret and then used them for surveillance and intelligence gathering.   Why is it so hard to keep these cyberweapons under wraps?   Unlike nuclear weapons, which can be guarded and protected, cyberweapons are ''just computer programs which can be pirated like any other,'' WikiLeaks notes. ''Since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost.''   There is a growing black market dedicated to trading these weapons, and government agencies from around the world will pay well for their discovery.     "
Indictment Describes Collusion Between Cyberthief and 2 Russian Agents,"Alexsey Belan's career as a successful cyberthief was nearly derailed in 2013 when he was arrested in Greece at the request of American authorities. But he evaded extradition and slipped back into Russia. Back at home, Mr. Belan stayed busy stealing credit cards and populating the internet with ads for erectile dysfunction treatments, but he was no longer working only for himself. He was put to work by Russia's main intelligence directorate, the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., on a very ambitious project: to breach Yahoo and steal account information from hundreds of millions of users.    The relationship between Mr. Belan and two Russian agents -- Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev and Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin -- was described in an indictment unsealed on Wednesday in federal court in San Francisco. If true, the allegations offer an extraordinary case study of Russian cyberespionage, and particularly the symbiotic relationship between identity thieves and spammers and Russia's elite intelligence services.    Cybersecurity experts and the F.B.I. have long suspected that Russian spies employed and protected criminal hackers to a striking degree, but evidence has been scarce. The indictment made public on Wednesday describes this collusion in detail for the first time.   The Justice Department alleges that the F.S.B. agents provided Mr. Belan with the tools of Russian spycraft to minimize detection by American law enforcement. At their direction, he helped surveil foreign officials and even Russian citizens, including a newspaper reporter and an officer with the Internal Affairs Ministry.   Ultimately, the team stole the subscriber information of more than 500 million accounts in 2014, and used proprietary Yahoo software to gain access to about 6,500 of them.   Exactly what information the Russian spies obtained is not clear from the court papers. But prosecutors noted that some of the accounts that were penetrated belonged to American government officials, ''including cybersecurity, diplomatic, military and White House personnel,'' according to the indictment. The court papers also outlined a secondary scheme, in which the F.S.B. officers paid a Canadian hacker to breach individual Gmail accounts.   The indictment reveals varying tactics used by Russian intelligence at a time when officials are still investigating what the American intelligence community has characterized as Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 election. There were low-tech strategies like the basic spear-phishing attacks that have become a fact of life for anyone online. And more exotic schemes, such as tricking Yahoo into believing that a computer in Russia was in fact a certain user's home computer, allowing Russian intelligence officials instant access to an email account without a password.   The list of targets is a glimpse into both the global reach of Russia's spying apparatus and the internecine power struggles of Russia's competing security agencies. Russian government officials were among the victims -- including an officer with the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry's cybercrime unit -- suggesting that the F.S.B. was using its own intelligence resources to gain an advantage over a rival agency.   ''All Russian intel agencies are competitive and carnivorous,'' Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, said.   Mr. Belan, who is 29 and has red-tinted hair, came into the F.B.I.'s cross hairs about five years ago, and was previously indicted on charges related to hacking into e-commerce companies. In December, in response to the American intelligence community's conclusion that Russia had tried to meddle in the presidential election, the Obama administration announced sanctions against Mr. Belan and Evgeniy M. Bogachev, who is also suspected of being a cyberthief and appears also to have ties to Russian intelligence.   Arkady Bukh, the Manhattan lawyer who represented Mr. Belan after his arrest in Greece, said he had not heard from Mr. Belan since he skipped bail and returned to Russia in 2013.   ''For the last couple of years he cannot be reached,'' Mr. Bukh said. ''He disappeared.''   But even while working under Russian intelligence, Mr. Belan kept up his old rackets. Once he breached Yahoo, he began searching for things to steal, such as gift cards or credit card numbers found in email accounts. According to the indictment, he ran a large spam campaign, and also tweaked some of the servers associated with Yahoo's search engine so that men searching for erectile dysfunction medication would be redirected to an online pharmacy that paid him a commission for driving traffic to the site.   The indictment does not say how Mr. Belan was recruited, or whether the idea for the Yahoo breach originated with him or the F.S.B. Nor does the indictment say how the F.B.I. identified Mr. Belan and the F.S.B. agents.   Officials provided little information about Mr. Sushchin, 43, an F.S.B. supervisor who the indictment says was embedded as a cybersecurity expert in a Russian financial firm. But there is plenty of intrigue swirling about Mr. Dokuchaev, 33, whom the indictment describes as Mr. Belan's direct F.S.B. contact.   In Russia, Mr. Dokuchaev was arrested on suspicion of treason in early December and accused of passing secret information to the United States. The authorities have offered no public details of the charges, in what is the highest-profile counterintelligence detentions in the post-Soviet period.   After the arrests, RBC, a respected Moscow newspaper, described Mr. Dokuchaev as a former hacker using the online pseudonym ''Forb'' -- who agreed work for the F.S.B. to avoid prosecution for credit card fraud.   In an interview with Vedomosti newspaper in 2004, a hacker identified as Forb bragged about hacking a ''U.S. government website,'' calling it his ''crowning achievement.''

Documents Said to Reveal Hacking Secrets of C.I.A.,"Follow Matthew Rosenberg on Twitter at @AllMattNYT WASHINGTON -- In what appears to be the largest leak of C.I.A documents in history, WikiLeaks released on Tuesday thousands of pages describing sophisticated software tools and techniques used by the agency to break into smartphones, computers and even Internet-connected televisions. The documents amount to a detailed, highly technical catalog of tools. They include instructions for compromising a wide range of common computer tools for use in spying: the online calling service Skype; Wi-Fi networks; documents in PDF format; and even commercial antivirus programs of the kind used by millions of people to protect their computers.    A program called Wrecking Crew explains how to crash a targeted computer, and another tells how to steal passwords using the autocomplete function on Internet Explorer. Other programs were called CrunchyLimeSkies, ElderPiggy, AngerQuake and McNugget.   The document dump was the latest coup for the antisecrecy organization and a serious blow to the C.I.A., which uses its hacking abilities to carry out espionage against foreign targets.    The initial release, which WikiLeaks said was only the first installment in a larger collection of secret C.I.A. material, included 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments, many of them partly redacted by WikiLeaks editors to avoid disclosing the actual code for cyberweapons. The entire archive of C.I.A. material consists of several hundred million lines of computer code, the group claimed.   In one revelation that may especially trouble the tech world if confirmed, WikiLeaks said that the C.I.A. and allied intelligence services have managed to compromise both Apple and Android smartphones, allowing their officers to bypass the encryption on popular services such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram. According to WikiLeaks, government hackers can penetrate smartphones and collect ''audio and message traffic before encryption is applied.''   Unlike the National Security Agency documents Edward J. Snowden gave to journalists in 2013, they do not include examples of how the tools have been used against actual foreign targets. That could limit the damage of the leak to national security. But the breach was highly embarrassing for an agency that depends on secrecy.   Robert M. Chesney, a specialist in national security law at the University of Texas at Austin, likened the C.I.A. trove to National Security Agency hacking tools disclosed last year by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers.   ''If this is true, it says that N.S.A. isn't the only one with an advanced, persistent problem with operational security for these tools,'' Mr. Chesney said. ''We're getting bit time and again.''   There was no public confirmation of the authenticity of the documents, which were produced by the C.I.A.'s Center for Cyber Intelligence and are mostly dated from 2013 to 2016. But one government official said the documents were real, and a former intelligence officer said some of the code names for C.I.A. programs, an organization chart and the description of a C.I.A. hacking base appeared to be genuine.   The agency appeared to be taken by surprise by the document dump on Tuesday morning. A C.I.A. spokesman, Dean Boyd, said, ''We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents.''   In some regard, the C.I.A. documents confirmed and filled in the details on abilities that have long been suspected in technical circles.   ''The people who know a lot about security and hacking assumed that the C.I.A. was at least investing in these capabilities, and if they weren't, then somebody else was -- China, Iran, Russia, as well as a lot of other private actors,'' said Beau Woods, the deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council in Washington. He said the disclosures may raise concerns in the United States and abroad about ''the trustworthiness of technology where cybersecurity can impact human life and public safety.''   There is no evidence that the C.I.A. hacking tools have been used against Americans. But Ben Wizner, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said the documents suggest that the government has deliberately allowed vulnerabilities in phones and other devices to persist to make spying easier.   ''Those vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and governments around the world,'' Mr. Wizner said. ''Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone's digital life safer.''   WikiLeaks did not identify the source of the documents, which it called Vault 7, but said they had been ''circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.''   WikiLeaks said the source, in a statement, set out policy questions that ''urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the C.I.A.'s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.'' The source, the group said, ''wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.''   But James Lewis, an expert on cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, raised another possibility: that a foreign state, most likely Russia, stole the documents by hacking or other means and delivered them to WikiLeaks, which may not know how they were obtained. Mr. Lewis noted that, according to American intelligence agencies, Russia hacked Democratic targets during the presidential campaign and gave thousands of emails to WikiLeaks for publication.   ''I think a foreign power is much more likely the source of these documents than a conscience-stricken C.I.A. whistle-blower,'' Mr. Lewis said.   At a time of increasing concern about the privacy of calls and messages, the revelations did not suggest that the C.I.A. can actually break the encryption used by popular messaging apps. Instead, by penetrating the user's phone, the agency can make the encryption irrelevant by intercepting messages and calls before their content is encrypted, or, on the other end, after messages are decrypted.   WikiLeaks, which has sometimes been accused of recklessly leaking information that could do harm, said it had redacted names and other identifying information from the collection. It said it was not releasing the computer code for actual, usable weapons ''until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.'s program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published.''   The codes names used for projects revealed in the WikiLeaks documents appear to reflect the likely demographic of the cyberexperts employed by the C.I.A. -- that is, young and male. There are numerous references to ''Harry Potter,'' Pokémon and Adderall, the drug used to treat hyperactivity.   A number of projects were named after whiskey brands. Some were high-end single malt scotches, such as Laphroaig and Ardbeg. Others were from more pedestrian labels, such as Wild Turkey, which was described by its programmers, in mock dictionary style, as ''(n.) A animal of the avian variety that has not been domesticated. Also a type of alcohol with a high proof (151).''   Some of the details of the C.I.A. programs might have come from the plot of a spy novel for the cyberage, revealing numerous highly classified -- and, in some cases, exotic -- hacking programs. One program, code-named Weeping Angel, uses Samsung ''smart'' televisions as covert listening devices. According to the WikiLeaks news release, even when it appears to be turned off, the television ''operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a covert C.I.A. server.''   The release said the program was developed in cooperation with British intelligence.   If C.I.A. agents did manage to hack the smart TVs, they would not be the only ones. Since their release, internet-connected televisions have been a focus for hackers and cybersecurity experts, many of whom see the sets' ability to record and transmit conversations as a potentially dangerous vulnerability.   In early 2015, Samsung started to include in the fine print terms of service for its smart TVs a warning that the television sets could capture background conversations. ''Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition,'' the warning said.   Another program described in the documents, named Umbrage, is a voluminous library of cyberattack techniques that the C.I.A. has collected from malware produced by other countries, including Russia. According to the WikiLeaks release, the large number of techniques allows the C.I.A. to mask the origin of some of its attacks and confuse forensic investigators.   The WikiLeaks material includes lists of software tools that the C.I.A. uses to create exploits and malware to carrying out hacking. Many of the tools are those used by developers around the world: coding languages, such as Python, and tools like Sublime Text, a program used to write code, and Git, a tool that helps developers collaborate.   But the agency also appears to rely on software designed specifically for spies, such as Ghidra, which in one of the documents is described as ''a reverse engineering environment created by the N.S.A.''   The Vault 7 release marks the latest in a series of huge leaks that have changed the landscape for government and corporate secrecy.   In scale, the Vault 7 archive appears to fall into the same category as the biggest leaks of classified information in recent years, including the quarter-million diplomatic cables taken by Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst, and given to WikiLeaks in 2010, and the hundreds of thousands of National Security Agency documents taken by Mr. Snowden in 2013.   In the business world, the so-called Panama Papers and several other large-volume leaks have laid bare the details of secret offshore companies used by wealthy and corrupt people to hide their assets.   Both government and corporate leaks have been made possible by the ease of downloading, storing and transferring millions of documents in seconds or minutes, a sea change from the use of slow photocopying for some earlier leaks, including the Pentagon Papers in 1971.

Deep Security Breach Cripples N.S.A.,"WASHINGTON -- Jake Williams awoke last April in an Orlando, Fla., hotel where he was leading a training session. Checking Twitter, Mr. Williams, a cybersecurity expert, was dismayed to discover that he had been thrust into the middle of one of the worst security debacles ever to befall American intelligence. Mr. Williams had written on his company blog about the Shadow Brokers, a mysterious group that had somehow obtained many of the hacking tools the United States used to spy on other countries. Now the group had replied in an angry screed on Twitter. It identified him -- correctly -- as a former member of the National Security Agency's hacking group, Tailored Access Operations, or T.A.O., a job he had not publicly disclosed. Then the Shadow Brokers astonished him by dropping technical details that made clear they knew about highly classified hacking operations that he had conducted.    America's largest and most secretive intelligence agency had been deeply infiltrated.    ''They had operational insight that even most of my fellow operators at T.A.O. did not have,'' said Mr. Williams, now with Rendition Infosec, a cybersecurity firm he founded. ''I felt like I'd been kicked in the gut. Whoever wrote this either was a well-placed insider or had stolen a lot of operational data.''   The jolt to Mr. Williams from the Shadow Brokers' riposte was part of a much broader earthquake that has shaken the N.S.A. to its core. Current and former agency officials say the Shadow Brokers disclosures, which began in August 2016, have been catastrophic for the N.S.A., calling into question its ability to protect potent cyberweapons and its very value to national security. The agency regarded as the world's leader in breaking into adversaries' computer networks failed to protect its own.   ''These leaks have been incredibly damaging to our intelligence and cyber capabilities,'' said Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary and director of the Central Intelligence Agency. ''The fundamental purpose of intelligence is to be able to effectively penetrate our adversaries in order to gather vital intelligence. By its very nature, that only works if secrecy is maintained and our codes are protected.''   With a leak of intelligence methods like the N.S.A. tools, Mr. Panetta said, ''Every time it happens, you essentially have to start over.''   Fifteen months into a wide-ranging investigation by the agency's counterintelligence arm, known as Q Group, and the F.B.I., officials still do not know whether the N.S.A. is the victim of a brilliantly executed hack, with Russia as the most likely perpetrator, an insider's leak, or both. Three employees have been arrested since 2015 for taking classified files, but there is fear that one or more leakers may still be in place. And there is broad agreement that the damage from the Shadow Brokers already far exceeds the harm to American intelligence done by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who fled with four laptops of classified material in 2013.   Mr. Snowden's cascade of disclosures to journalists and his defiant public stance drew far more media coverage than this new breach. But Mr. Snowden released code words, while the Shadow Brokers have released the actual code; if he shared what might be described as battle plans, they have loosed the weapons themselves. Created at huge expense to American taxpayers, those cyberweapons have now been picked up by hackers from North Korea to Russia and shot back at the United States and its allies.   Millions of people saw their computers shut down by ransomware, with demands for payments in digital currency to have their access restored. Tens of thousands of employees at Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo cookies, had their data completely wiped. FedEx reported that an attack on a European subsidiary had halted deliveries and cost $300 million. Hospitals in Pennsylvania, Britain and Indonesia had to turn away patients. The attacks disrupted production at a car plant in France, an oil company in Brazil and a chocolate factory in Tasmania, among thousands of enterprises affected worldwide.   American officials had to explain to close allies -- and to business leaders in the United States -- how cyberweapons developed at Fort Meade in Maryland came to be used against them. Experts believe more attacks using the stolen N.S.A. tools are all but certain.   Inside the agency's Maryland headquarters and its campuses around the country, N.S.A. employees have been subjected to polygraphs and suspended from their jobs in a hunt for turncoats allied with the Shadow Brokers. Much of the agency's arsenal is still being replaced, curtailing operations. Morale has plunged, and experienced specialists are leaving the agency for better-paying jobs -- including with firms defending computer networks from intrusions that use the N.S.A.'s leaked tools.   ''It's a disaster on multiple levels,'' Mr. Williams said. ''It's embarrassing that the people responsible for this have not been brought to justice.''   In response to detailed questions, an N.S.A. spokesman, Michael T. Halbig, said the agency ''cannot comment on Shadow Brokers.'' He denied that the episode had hurt morale. ''N.S.A. continues to be viewed as a great place to work; we receive more than 140,000 applications each year for our hiring program,'' he said.   Compounding the pain for the N.S.A. is the attackers' regular online public taunts, written in ersatz broken English. Their posts are a peculiar mash-up of immaturity and sophistication, laced with profane jokes but also savvy cultural and political references. They suggest that their author -- if not an American -- knows the United States well.   ''Is NSA chasing shadowses?'' the Shadow Brokers asked in a post on Oct. 16, mocking the agency's inability to understand the leaks and announcing a price cut for subscriptions to its ''monthly dump service'' of stolen N.S.A. tools. It was a typically wide-ranging screed, touching on George Orwell's ''1984''; the end of the federal government's fiscal year on Sept. 30; Russia's creation of bogus accounts on Facebook and Twitter; and the phenomenon of American intelligence officers going to work for contractors who pay higher salaries.   One passage, possibly hinting at the Shadow Brokers' identity, underscored the close relationship of Russian intelligence to criminal hackers. ''Russian security peoples,'' it said, ''is becoming Russian hackeres at nights, but only full moons.''   Russia is the prime suspect in a parallel hemorrhage of hacking tools and secret documents from the C.I.A.'s Center for Cyber Intelligence, posted week after week since March to the WikiLeaks website under the names Vault7 and Vault8. That breach, too, is unsolved. Together, the flood of digital secrets from agencies that invest huge resources in preventing such breaches is raising profound questions.   Have hackers and leakers made secrecy obsolete? Has Russian intelligence simply outplayed the United States, penetrating the most closely guarded corners of its government? Can a work force of thousands of young, tech-savvy spies ever be immune to leaks?   Some veteran intelligence officials believe a lopsided focus on offensive weapons and hacking tools has, for years, left American cyberdefense dangerously porous.   ''We have had a train wreck coming,'' said Mike McConnell, the former N.S.A. director and national intelligence director. ''We should have ratcheted up the defense parts significantly.''   America's Cyber Special Forces   At the heart of the N.S.A. crisis is Tailored Access Operations, the group where Mr. Williams worked, which was absorbed last year into the agency's new Directorate of Operations.   T.A.O. -- the outdated name is still used informally -- began years ago as a side project at the agency's research and engineering building at Fort Meade. It was a cyber Skunk Works, akin to the special units that once built stealth aircraft and drones. As Washington's need for hacking capabilities grew, T.A.O. expanded into a separate office park in Laurel, Md., with additional teams at facilities in Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii and Texas.   The hacking unit attracts many of the agency's young stars, who like the thrill of internet break-ins in the name of national security, according to a dozen former government officials who agreed to describe its work on the condition of anonymity. T.A.O. analysts start with a shopping list of desired information and likely sources -- say, a Chinese official's home computer or a Russian oil company's network. Much of T.A.O.'s work is labeled E.C.I., for ''exceptionally controlled information,'' material so sensitive it was initially stored only in safes. When the cumulative weight of the safes threatened the integrity of N.S.A.'s engineering building a few years ago, one agency veteran said, the rules were changed to allow locked file cabinets.   The more experienced T.A.O. operators devise ways to break into foreign networks; junior operators take over to extract information. Mr. Williams, 40, a former paramedic who served in military intelligence in the Army before joining the N.S.A., worked in T.A.O. from 2008 to 2013, which he described as an especially long tenure. He called the work ''challenging and sometimes exciting.''   T.A.O. operators must constantly renew their arsenal to stay abreast of changing software and hardware, examining every Windows update and new iPhone for vulnerabilities. ''The nature of the business is to move with the technology,'' a former T.A.O. hacker said.   Long known mainly as an eavesdropping agency, the N.S.A. has embraced hacking as an especially productive way to spy on foreign targets. The intelligence collection is often automated, with malware implants -- computer code designed to find material of interest -- left sitting on the targeted system for months or even years, sending files back to the N.S.A.   The same implant can be used for many purposes: to steal documents, tap into email, subtly change data or become the launching pad for an attack. T.A.O.'s most public success was an operation against Iran called Olympic Games, in which implants in the network of the Natanz nuclear plant caused centrifuges enriching uranium to self-destruct. The T.A.O. was also critical to attacks on the Islamic State and North Korea.   It was this arsenal that the Shadow Brokers got hold of, and then began to release.   Like cops studying a burglar's operating style and stash of stolen goods, N.S.A. analysts have tried to figure out what the Shadow Brokers took. None of the leaked files date from later than 2013 -- a relief to agency officials assessing the damage. But they include a large share of T.A.O.'s collection, including three so-called ops disks -- T.A.O.'s term for tool kits -- containing the software to bypass computer firewalls, penetrate Windows and break into the Linux systems most commonly used on Android phones.   Evidence shows that the Shadow Brokers obtained the entire tool kits intact, suggesting that an insider might have simply pocketed a thumb drive and walked out.   But other files obtained by the Shadow Brokers bore no relation to the ops disks and seem to have been grabbed at different times. Some were designed for a compromise by the N.S.A. of Swift, a global financial messaging system, allowing the agency to track bank transfers. There was a manual for an old system code-named UNITEDRAKE, used to attack Windows. There were PowerPoint presentations and other files not used in hacking, making it unlikely that the Shadow Brokers had simply grabbed tools left on the internet by sloppy N.S.A. hackers.   Some officials doubt that the Shadow Brokers got it all by hacking the most secure of American government agencies -- hence the search for insiders. But some T.A.O. hackers think that skilled, persistent attackers might have been able to get through the N.S.A.'s defenses -- because, as one put it, ''I know we've done it to other countries.''   The Shadow Brokers have verbally attacked certain experts, including Mr. Williams. When he concluded from their Twitter hints that they knew about some of his hacks while at the N.S.A., he canceled a business trip to Singapore. The United States had named and criminally charged hackers from the intelligence agencies of China, Iran and Russia. He feared he could be similarly charged by a country he had targeted and arrested on an international warrant.   He has since resumed traveling abroad. But he says no one from the N.S.A. has contacted him about being singled out publicly by the Shadow Brokers.   ''That feels like a betrayal,'' he said. ''I was targeted by the Shadow Brokers because of that work. I do not feel the government has my back.''   The Hunt for an Insider   For decades after its creation in 1952, the N.S.A. -- No Such Agency, in the old joke -- was seen as all but leakproof. But since Mr. Snowden flew away with hundreds of thousands of documents in 2013, that notion has been shattered.   The Snowden trauma led to the investment of millions of dollars in new technology and tougher rules to counter what the government calls the insider threat. But N.S.A. employees say that with thousands of employees pouring in and out of the gates, and the ability to store a library's worth of data in a device that can fit on a key ring, it is impossible to prevent people from walking out with secrets.   The agency has active investigations into at least three former N.S.A. employees or contractors. Two had worked for T.A.O.: a still publicly unidentified software developer secretly arrested after taking hacking tools home in 2015, only to have Russian hackers lift them from his home computer; and Harold T. Martin III, a contractor arrested last year when F.B.I. agents found his home, garden shed and car stuffed with sensitive agency documents and storage devices he had taken over many years when a work-at-home habit got out of control, his lawyers say. The third is Reality Winner, a young N.S.A. linguist arrested in June, who is charged with leaking to the news site The Intercept a single classified report on a Russian breach of an American election systems vendor.   Mr. Martin's gargantuan collection of stolen files included much of what the Shadow Brokers have, and he has been scrutinized by investigators as a possible source for them. Officials say they do not believe he deliberately supplied the material, though they have examined whether he might have been targeted by thieves or hackers.   But according to former N.S.A. employees who are still in touch with active workers, investigators of the Shadow Brokers thefts are clearly worried that one or more leakers may still be inside the agency. Some T.A.O. employees have been asked to turn over their passports, take time off their jobs and submit to questioning. The small number of specialists who have worked both at T.A.O. and at the C.I.A. have come in for particular attention, out of concern that a single leaker might be responsible for both the Shadow Brokers and the C.I.A.'s Vault7 breaches.   Then there are the Shadow Brokers' writings, which betray a seeming immersion in American culture. Last April, about the time Mr. Williams was discovering their inside knowledge of T.A.O. operations, the Shadow Brokers posted an appeal to President Trump: ''Don't Forget Your Base.'' With the ease of a seasoned pundit, they tossed around details about Stephen K. Bannon, the president's now departed adviser; the Freedom Caucus in Congress; the ''deep state''; the Alien and Sedition Acts; and white privilege.   ''TheShadowBrokers is wanting to see you succeed,'' the post said, addressing Mr. Trump. ''TheShadowBrokers is wanting America to be great again.''   The mole hunt is inevitably creating an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety, former employees say. While the attraction of the N.S.A. for skilled operators is unique -- nowhere else can they hack without getting into legal trouble -- the boom in cybersecurity hiring by private companies gives T.A.O. veterans lucrative exit options.   Young T.A.O. hackers are lucky to make $80,000 a year, while those who leave routinely find jobs paying well over $100,000, security specialists say. For many workers, the appeal of the N.S.A's mission has been more than enough to make up the difference. But over the past year, former T.A.O. employees say an increasing number of former colleagues have called them looking for private-sector work, including ''graybeards'' they thought would be N.S.A. lifers.   ''Snowden killed morale,'' another T.A.O. analyst said. ''But at least we knew who he was. Now you have a situation where the agency is questioning people who have been 100 percent mission-oriented, telling them they're liars.''   Because the N.S.A. hacking unit has grown so rapidly over the past decade, the pool of potential leakers has expanded into the hundreds. Trust has eroded as anyone who had access to the leaked code is regarded as the potential culprit.   Some agency veterans have seen projects they worked on for a decade shut down because implants they relied on were dumped online by the Shadow Brokers. The number of new operations has declined because the malware tools must be rebuilt. And no end is in sight.   ''How much longer are the releases going to come?'' a former T.A.O. employee asked. ''The agency doesn't know how to stop it -- or even what 'it' is.''   One N.S.A. official who almost saw his career ended by the Shadow Brokers is at the very top of the organization: Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the N.S.A. and commander of its sister military organization, United States Cyber Command. President Barack Obama's director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, recommended removing Admiral Rogers from his post to create accountability for the breaches.   But Mr. Obama did not act on the advice, in part because Admiral Rogers's agency was at the center of the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump, who again on Saturday disputed his intelligence agencies' findings on Russia and the election, extended the admiral's time in office. Some former intelligence officials say they are flabbergasted that he has been able to hold on to his job.   A Shadow War With Russia?   Lurking in the background of the Shadow Brokers investigation is American officials' strong belief that it is a Russian operation. The pattern of dribbling out stolen documents over many months, they say, echoes the slow release of Democratic emails purloined by Russian hackers last year.   But there is a more specific back story to the United States-Russia rivalry.   Starting in 2014, American security researchers who had been tracking Russia's state-sponsored hacking groups for years began to expose them in a series of research reports. American firms, including Symantec, CrowdStrike and FireEye, reported that Moscow was behind certain attacks and identified government-sponsored Russian hacking groups.   In the meantime, Russia's most prominent cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, had started work on a report that would turn the tables on the United States. Kaspersky hunted for the spying malware planted by N.S.A. hackers, guided in part by the keywords and code names in the files taken by Mr. Snowden and published by journalists, officials said.   Kaspersky was, in a sense, simply doing to the N.S.A. what the American companies had just done to Russian intelligence: expose their operations. And American officials believe Russian intelligence was piggybacking on Kaspersky's efforts to find and retrieve the N.S.A.'s secrets wherever they could be found. The T.A.O. hackers knew that when Kaspersky updated its popular antivirus software to find and block the N.S.A. malware, it could thwart spying operations around the world.   So T.A.O. personnel rushed to replace implants in many countries with new malware they did not believe the Russian company could detect.   In February 2015, Kaspersky published its report on the Equation Group -- the company's name for T.A.O. hackers -- and updated its antivirus software to uproot the N.S.A. malware wherever it had not been replaced. The agency temporarily lost access to a considerable flow of intelligence. By some accounts, however, N.S.A. officials were relieved that the Kaspersky report did not include certain tools they feared the Russian company had found.   As it would turn out, any celebration was premature.   On Aug. 13 last year, a new Twitter account using the Shadow Brokers' name announced with fanfare an online auction of stolen N.S.A. hacking tools.   ''We hack Equation Group,'' the Shadow Brokers wrote. ''We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons.''   Inside the N.S.A., the declaration was like a bomb exploding. A zip file posted online contained the first free sample of the agency's hacking tools. It was immediately evident that the Shadow Brokers were not hoaxsters, and that the agency was in trouble.   The leaks have renewed a debate over whether the N.S.A. should be permitted to stockpile vulnerabilities it discovers in commercial software to use for spying -- rather than immediately alert software makers so the holes can be plugged. The agency claims it has shared with the industry more than 90 percent of flaws it has found, reserving only the most valuable for its own hackers. But if it can't keep those from leaking, as the last year has demonstrated, the resulting damage to businesses and ordinary computer users around the world can be colossal. The Trump administration says it will soon announce revisions to the system, making it more transparent.   Mr. Williams said it may be years before the ''full fallout'' of the Shadow Brokers breach is understood. Even the arrest of whoever is responsible for the leaks may not end them, he said -- because the sophisticated perpetrators may have built a ''dead man's switch'' to release all remaining files automatically upon their arrest.   ''We're obviously dealing with people who have operational security knowledge,'' he said. ''They have the whole law enforcement system and intelligence system after them. And they haven't been caught.''     "
"Fortifying Its 'Great Firewall,' China Blocks WhatsApp Services","SHANGHAI -- The last of Facebook's major products that still worked in China was disrupted by the government on Tuesday, as Beijing broadly tightened its controls over the internet. The product, WhatsApp, a messaging app used across the globe, was partly blocked by Chinese filters, leaving many unable to send videos and photos and some also unable to send text-based messages.    The disruption of WhatsApp was the latest in a long line of big digital services running up against China's ''Great Firewall,'' the country's system of internet filters and controls. In recent weeks, the government has appeared to increase its grip, an online crackdown fed by a perfect storm of politically sensitive news, important events and a new cybersecurity law that went into effect last month.   Sites hosting popular foreign television shows have had videos taken down, and tools used to skirt the censors have faced more frequent disruptions. In an article, the mouthpiece of the country's Communist Party scolded the Chinese internet company Tencent over a popular video game, calling it too addictive.    The news environment has intensified the government's online scrutiny. In recent weeks, the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo died in detention. A Chinese billionaire in the United States accused senior leaders of graft, using his platform on Twitter. And Hong Kong commemorated the 20th anniversary of its handover to China.   To complicate matters, the 19th Party Congress -- where top leadership positions are determined -- is just months away. The government puts an increased emphasis on stability in the run up to the event, which happens every five years, often leading to a tightening of internet controls.   WhatsApp, which had generally avoided major disruptions in China despite the full block of Facebook and Instagram, appears to have become a victim of those circumstances.   The blocks against WhatsApp originated with the government, according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the record about the disruption. Security experts also verified that the partial disruption in WhatsApp started with China's internet filters.   ''According to the analysis that we ran today on WhatsApp's infrastructure, it seems that the Great Firewall is imposing censorship that selectively targets WhatsApp functionalities,'' said Nadim Kobeissi, an applied cryptographer at Symbolic Software, a cryptography research start-up.   The actions by the Chinese government are another setback for Facebook in a country that has been difficult for the world's largest social network to crack. Its flagship site was blocked in 2009 after ethnic unrest in western China; Instagram followed in 2014 during protests that fall in Hong Kong.   Beginning in late 2014, Facebook began an aggressive campaign to woo the Chinese government and get its main social network back into the country. As part of the courtship, Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, showed off his language chops at a conference and later dined with President Xi Jinping during a state visit to the United States.   But Facebook's efforts have slowed over the past year, and it has little to show for itself. Instead of getting a new product into China, the internet giant now faces the reality that its last app standing is under threat of being pushed outside the walls of Chinese censorship.   A spokeswoman for WhatsApp declined to comment.   Since taking power almost five years ago, Mr. Xi has presided over a consistent and deepening suppression of internet freedom. He has been vocal in calling for China to establish sovereignty online, and has set up a new internet regulator to consolidate controls over the web.   The scale of the recent actions shows the increasing muscle of the Chinese government, which has strengthened this year.   In recent months, a number of virtual private networks, tools that allow users in China to access the broader internet around the world, were removed from app stores or shut down. China's telecom regulator said it would ban unauthorized VPNs starting in February 2018.   The new cybersecurity rules, broad and vague, have left Western companies uncertain of how they will be applied and what impact they could have on a difficult operating environment. The government has put strong emphasis on the law, which could serve as a watershed for how the internet is managed and foreign companies are policed.   This month, Apple opened its first data center in China. The company said the move was made to comply with the law that calls for companies to store their data in China.   The disruption of encrypted messaging programs like WhatsApp and censorship circumvention tools like VPNs shows a desire to take almost total control over how the internet is used.   WhatsApp is hugely popular around much of the globe, but the platform is not widely used in China, where local messaging app WeChat dominates. Even so, WhatsApp provides encrypted messaging, making it a useful tool for many Chinese to communicate or do business outside the country or in Hong Kong.   Paul Triolo, the head of geo-technology at Eurasia Group, said that a possible next step would be for China to target other encrypted messaging apps like Signal, pointing out that such apps ''represent a small but growing and potentially important hole in the Great Firewall.''   ''The ministries and support organizations that undergird the Great Firewall must constantly prove they can keep abreast of technological change, and encrypted messaging apps are just the latest in a long string of innovations that have drawn the attention of the technical wizards behind the Great Firewall,'' Mr. Triolo said.   The apparent crackdown is part of the jockeying among Chinese ministries ahead of this autumn's congress to show that they are doing their job, according to a government tech policy adviser who declined to be named because of possible retribution over speaking to foreign news media. While there is a real push to make it harder to use VPNs, he said the new rules set to take effect next year are unlikely to be so extreme that they entirely prevent individuals from being able to use such tools.   Some in the Chinese government are worried that the excess censorship and controls are damaging the country's ability to access crucial information, like scientific papers and other educational resources. As such, there have been calls for a more surgical way to block specific material, rather than a sledgehammer approach that takes out entire services.   In the case of WhatsApp, it is not clear whether the targeted censorship of videos and photos was intentional, or if it was just a prelude to a more complete block. Previous partial blocks have sometimes led to full bans, or they have eventually been removed by the government, and service restored.   Beijing's track record with other American social networking services does not bode well for WhatsApp. Besides Facebook and Instagram, Twitter, Google and Gmail are all blocked in the country.   ''It's like when Gmail first got throttled, the blockage was very uneven,'' said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.     "
A Solution To Hackers? Add More Hackers,"If there's a single lesson Americans have learned from the events of the past year, it might be this: Hackers are dangerous people. They interfere in our elections, bring giant corporations to their knees, and steal passwords and credit card numbers by the truckload. They ignore boundaries. They delight in creating chaos. But what if that's the wrong narrative? What if we're ignoring a different group of hackers who aren't lawless renegades, who are in fact patriotic, public-spirited Americans who want to use their technical skills to protect our country from cyberattacks, but are being held back by outdated rules and overly protective institutions?    In other words: What if the problem we face is not too many bad hackers, but too few good ones?    The topic of ethical hacking was on everyone's mind at Def Con, the hacker convention last week in Las Vegas. It's the security community's annual gathering, where thousands of hackers gathered to show their latest exploits, discuss new security research and swap cyberwar stories. Many of the hackers I spoke to were gravely concerned about Russia's wide-ranging interference in last year's election. They wanted to know: How can we stop attacks like these in the future?   The problem, they told me, is that the government doesn't make it easy for well-meaning hackers to pitch in on defense. Laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act make poking around inside many government systems, even for innocent research purposes, a criminal offense. More than 209,000 cybersecurity jobs in the United States currently sit unfilled, according to a 2015 analysis of labor data by Peninsula Press, and the former head of the National Security Agency said last year that the agency's cybersecurity experts ''are increasingly leaving in large numbers'' for jobs in the private sector.   Partly, that's because private sector jobs tend to pay more. But it's also because the government can be an inhospitable place for a hacker. Talented hackers can be disqualified for government jobs by strict background checks, and dissuaded by hiring processes that favor candidates with more formal credentials. At Def Con, I heard stories about hackers who had interviewed for government security jobs only to be turned away because they'd smoked pot as a teenager, or violated copyright law by jail-breaking their video game console.   These rules may keep a few bad apples away from critical government systems, but they also prevent many talented hackers from contributing. At Def Con, I spoke with Sean Kanuck, a former C.I.A. intelligence analyst who served as the federal government's national intelligence officer for cyberissues from 2011 to 2016. He said that hackers could be enormously valuable, if they were properly enlisted in the fight against attacks.   ''These people may be all hackers, and they may occasionally break the law, but they all still want the banking system to work,'' Mr. Kanuck said. ''All of them, if they end up in a hospital room, they want the infusion pump working. There's common ground. And the knowledge here is incredible.''   The private sector has already discovered the benefits of hackers. Most major tech companies -- including Facebook, Apple and Microsoft -- offer ''bug bounty'' programs, in which they offer financial rewards to hackers who find holes in their security measures. These companies know that paying hackers up front for their expertise is significantly cheaper than cleaning up after a breach, and they understand that the risk of a hacker going rogue inside their systems is outweighed by the benefits of having well-trained experts catch bugs and vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.   Government agencies are beginning to experiment with a similar approach. The Defense Department offered the first-ever federal bug bounty program last year, called Hack the Pentagon. The agency allowed more than 1,400 hackers to take aim at its public-facing websites without fear of punishment, and the effort resulted in 138 legitimate vulnerabilities being reported. A similar program involving the Department of Homeland Security has been proposed in the Senate.   The most talked-about session at this year's Def Con was when hackers were let loose on a series of computerized voting machines. These machines had been used in recent American elections, and most ran on comically outdated software. Hackers eventually broke into every machine and were able to manipulate the software to register fake ballots and change vote totals. (One enterprising hacker even rigged a voting machine to play the music video for Rick Astley's ''Never Gonna Give You Up.'')   There is, of course, the problem of outdated software. But some of the world's best security researchers have also been prohibited from poking and prodding at these machines by a thicket of copyright and anti-tampering laws. (The reason Def Con was able to test them at all is a 2015 exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that gave researchers a temporary pass to experiment on voting machines.) Now that white-hat hackers have found flaws in these machines, they can pass that knowledge on to the manufacturers and election officials, who can secure the machines ahead of the next election cycle.   Hackers, it turns out, respond to incentives. But current laws don't allow hackers to test critical government systems outside of official agency-sponsored programs. As a result, we're missing out on important advice.   Take it from me. Several years ago, as part of an article on ethical hacking, I invited a pair of world-class hackers to hack me, using all of the tools at their disposal. The results were shocking. Within days, the hackers had gained access to nearly every piece of my digital life: my cellphone, my bank account, all of my email inboxes and social media profiles. The hackers showed me how, with a few more clicks, they could have stolen all of my data and used it to ruin my life. Then, they helped me protect myself against a future attack by strengthening my passwords, fortifying my devices and teaching me what suspicious activities to look out for.   Not all hackers are so helpful. But many are, and we should take advantage of their willingness to help secure our national infrastructure. Maybe federal workers should be subjected to a simulated hack before being allowed to access sensitive information. Or perhaps the government could create a white list of approved security researchers with a track record of ethical hacking, who would be given legal immunity for their work. Private sector companies have figured out how to bring in outside security expertise carefully, without creating a hacker free-for-all, and the government can, too.   Spending a weekend at Def Con is a good way to learn how many dangers lurk in the digital world. (It wasn't just voting machines, hackers also demonstrated hacks on cars, kitchen appliances and all manner of other connected devices.) It's also a way to appreciate how necessary ethical hackers are to a modern democracy, especially one that is under siege from foreign online attackers.   To paraphrase an organization with close ties to the government: The only thing that stops a bad guy with a hack is a good guy with a hack.     "
Top Russian Cybercrimes Agent Arrested on Charges of Treason,"A senior official in the Russian cyberintelligence department that American officials say oversaw last year's election hacking has been arrested in Moscow on charges of treason, a Russian newspaper reported Wednesday. The arrest of Sergei Mikhailov, a senior officer of the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the main successor agency to the K.G.B., is a rare instance of turmoil in the country's usually shadowy cybersecurity apparatus slipping into public view. Mr. Mikhailov served in the F.S.B.'s Center for Information Security, the agency's cyberintelligence branch, which has been implicated in the American election hacking. But it is not clear whether the arrest was related to those intrusions.  He was detained along with one of Russia's leading private-sector cybersecurity experts, Ruslan Stoyanov, the head of computer incident response investigations at the Kaspersky Lab, which makes antivirus programs. The company confirmed in a statement that Mr. Stoyanov had been arrested, but said his arrest ""has nothing to do with Kaspersky Lab and its operations."" Still, the arrests of the men, who had cooperated in Russia to prosecute cybercriminals, shed light on the intersection of cybercrime, private antivirus companies and the Russian security services. Western cybersecurity analysts have said there are indications that the security services recruited among criminal hackers to carry out politicized computer intrusions ahead of last summer's hacking of the Democratic National Committee in the United States, giving the hackers impunity to commit financially motivated attacks in exchange for their expertise. The arrest raised the possibility that Mr. Mikhailov and Mr. Stoyanov had interfered in this cooperation. The newspaper article, in Kommersant, which cited unidentified sources in Moscow's technology industry and the F.S.B., said the treason charges related to work on criminal hacking investigations. Alternatively, the detention of an official who would have been in a position to engage in the election hacking in America could indicate a good-will gesture to the United States, which has penalized Russia for the electoral meddling. American intelligence agencies accused the F.S.B. and another Russian agency, the military's Main Intelligence Directorate, or G.R.U., of hacking the Democratic National Committee and other electoral targets. The sanctions targeted the two Russian intelligence agencies. But private American cybersecurity investigators say the F.S.B., where Mr. Mikhailov was the second-most senior figure in the Center for Information Security, operated a group nicknamed Cozy Bear that stole data but never released it. The G.R.U., the American cybersleuths say, operated a group called Fancy Bear that stole electronic data and released it in an effort to help Donald J. Trump win the presidential election. If confirmed, the arrest would be one of the highest-profile detentions for treason within the F.S.B. since the breakup of the Soviet Union. In another indication of high-level turmoil over cyberintelligence issues within the security agency, Kommersant reported on Jan. 13 that the director of the Center for Information Security, Andrei Gerasimov, would be fired. His termination was related to the investigation into the agency's cooperation with Kaspersky on criminal hacking cases. Mr. Gerasimov, who has led the Center for Information Security since 2009, was described as building close ties with companies like the Kaspersky Lab as an element in Russia's cybersecurity policy. He is also the deputy director for counterintelligence at the F.S.B. The F.S.B. did not respond to an email query about the arrests. Follow Andrew E. Kramer on Twitter @AndrewKramerNYT.

Someone Made a Fake Equifax Site. Then Equifax Linked to It.,"People create fake versions of big companies' websites all the time, usually for phishing purposes. But the companies do not usually link to them by mistake. Equifax, however, did just that after Nick Sweeting, a software engineer, created an imitation of equifaxsecurity2017.com, Equifax's page about the security breach that may have exposed 143 million Americans' personal information. Several posts from the company's Twitter account directed consumers to Mr. Sweeting's version, securityequifax2017.com. They were deleted after the mistake was publicized.    By Wednesday evening, the Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers had blacklisted Mr. Sweeting's site, and he took it down. By that time, he said, it had received about 200,000 hits.    Fortunately for the people who clicked, Mr. Sweeting's website was upfront about what it was. The layout was the same as the real version, complete with an identical prompt at the top: ''To enroll in complimentary identity theft protection and credit file monitoring, click here.'' But a headline in large text differed: ''Cybersecurity Incident & Important Consumer Information Which is Totally Fake, Why Did Equifax Use A Domain That's So Easily Impersonated By Phishing Sites?''   It would be just as easy for phishers to create their own versions of the Equifax page, and that would be bad news for anyone entering the information required to enroll in identity theft protection: their surname and the last six digits of their Social Security number. (In Mr. Sweeting's version, the form was disabled so that no information was saved.)   ''Their site is dangerously easy to impersonate,'' Mr. Sweeting said in an email, noting that he had created the site solely to draw attention to the weakness of Equifax's security. ''It only took me 20 minutes to build my clone. I can guarantee there are real malicious phishing versions already out there.''   ''It's in everyone's interest to get Equifax to change this site to a reputable domain,'' he added. ''I knew it would only cost me $10 to set up a site that would get people to notice, so I just did it.''   In a short statement on Wednesday, Equifax said all posts containing the wrong link had been deleted.   ''We apologize for the confusion,'' the statement said. ''Consumers should be aware of fake websites purporting to be operated by Equifax. Our dedicated website for consumers to learn more about the incident and sign up for free credit monitoring is https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, and our company homepage is equifax.com. Please be cautious of visiting other websites claiming to be operated by Equifax that do not originate from these two pages.''   An Equifax spokeswoman, Marisa Salcines, did not respond when asked why the company had created a separate website rather than a subdomain of equifax.com.   That, cybersecurity experts said, was the key mistake. Phishers cannot create a page on the equifax.com domain, so if the website were hosted there instead, it would be easy for users to tell that the page was legitimate.   ''You would think that would be the obvious place to start,'' said Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University. ''Create a subdomain so that if somebody tries to fake it, it becomes immediately obvious.''   ''Equifaxsecurity2017.com,'' on the other hand, looks so unofficial that Mr. Telang said even he had been unsure at first whether it was safe to enter his information.   Mr. Sweeting explained in his email that a Linux command, ''wget,'' allows anyone to download the contents of a website, ''including all images, HTML, CSS, etc.''   ''It was super easy to just suck their whole site down with wget and throw it on a $5 server,'' he wrote. ''It currently has the same type of SSL certificate as the real version, so from a trust perspective, there's no way for users to authenticate the real one vs. my server.''   Mr. Telang said Equifax's actions suggested that the company had never anticipated or planned for a data breach.   ''If you don't have a plan in place, you will find different ways to screw it up,'' he said. ''Equifax is just a perfect example of that.''   All of the incorrect tweets ended with ''-Tim,'' indicating the name of the Equifax employee who wrote them. The Equifax spokeswoman did not say whether any disciplinary action had been taken, and Mr. Sweeting said he hoped the employee had not been fired.   ''They probably just Googled for the URL and ended up finding the fake one instead,'' he said. ''The real blame lies with the people who originally decided to set the site up badly.''

England's Soccer Federation Asks FIFA to Address Cybersecurity Ahead of World Cup,"England's soccer federation has written to FIFA to express concerns about the leak of confidential antidoping correspondence by a hacking group believed to based in Russia, and to request assurances about the soccer governing body's cybersecurity preparations ahead of next year's World Cup there. Since last year, leaks by the hacking group, known as Fancy Bears, have revealed confidential medical information of scores of top athletes, including tennis champions, track stars and an Olympic gymnast, who had received exemptions to take medication usually be banned under doping regulations. In August, the group turned its attention to soccer, naming 25 players granted similar waivers, known as therapeutic use exemptions, to take otherwise prohibited substances at the 2010 World Cup.     Even before that hack, though, which also included an email from England's Football Association's integrity chief to FIFA, the English had been bolstering their cybersecurity to counter the growing threat from hackers worldwide, according to two people familiar with the organization's plans. Among the precautions expected to be in place in Russia next year -- England can qualify with a win or draw in its next match -- England's players and staff will be told to avoid public Wi-Fi networks as well as those in their team hotels, according to people familiar with the F.A.'s plans.   The Football Association declined to comment on the letter, though FIFA confirmed its existence.   ''We can confirm that The F.A. has sent a letter to FIFA related to the Fancy Bears attack,'' a FIFA spokesman said. ''In its reply, FIFA has informed The F.A. in such context that FIFA remains committed to preventing security attacks in general, and that with respect to the Fancy Bears attack in particular it is presently investigating the incident to ascertain whether FIFA's infrastructure was compromised.''   In mocking messages revealing the 25 players' names last month, the hackers also claimed there had been hundreds of positive doping tests in soccer in 2015 and 2016, including four in Britain linked to the use of the recreational drugs cocaine and ecstasy.   WADA said its servers had not been compromised in the soccer case, suggesting the information had been acquired from FIFA's computer systems.   Coaches at the World Cup zealously guard their tactics and team selection plans for the monthlong event, often erecting fences around training fields to prevent such information from leaking out. Shortly before France's opening game at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, a drone hovered above the team's practice session, leading the team's coach to express concerns about possible spying. At the 2015 Rugby World Cup, photographers managed to capture details of Australia's tactics after staff members failed to keep them covered during preparations for the championship match against New Zealand.   Fancy Bears' original leaks about international athletes emerged about four months after the The New York Times published the account of Russia's longtime antidoping chief, who revealed that he had run a yearslong doping program involving top Russian athletes. The hacks also are seen as a response to sports federations who banned  Russian athletes from the 2016 Rio Olympics.   Russia has denied that its government is behind the attacks. But law enforcement authorities have determined they originated there, according to the World Anti-Doping Agency.   ''For the purposes of computer security in general, FIFA is itself relying on expert advice from third parties,'' FIFA's spokesman said. ''It is for this reason that FIFA cannot and does not provide any computer security advice to third parties.''     "
Australian Cybersecurity Report Shows Gaps in Private Companies' Defenses,"MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government presented its annual cybersecurity report on Tuesday, revealing that one of its national security contractors had suffered a breach in which it lost a ''significant amount of data'' last year. Included in the report was a case study that said the government's cybersecurity team discovered that an attacker had compromised the network of a ''small Australian company with contracting links to national security projects,'' adding that the attacker was on the network for an ''extended period of time.''     Though the report outlined the breach as a case study, Dan Tehan, a minister tasked with advising the prime minister on cybersecurity, did not divulge specifics to the local news media about who was affected or what data might have been compromised. ''We don't know and we cannot confirm exactly who the actor was,'' he said Tuesday on ABC Radio.   The revelation of the security contractor's breach, and the lack of detail surrounding it, comes at a time of increased concern over the government's ability to protect citizens' personal information -- especially when accounting for third parties that have access to sensitive data.   Last week, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull introduced a far-reaching plan to collect Australians' driver's license photos and distribute them across security agencies, leaving open the possibility of sharing them with private companies. Privacy advocates criticized the plan as risky, with some pointing to a hacking attack on Australian census data last year, and the revelation this year that Australians' Medicare card details were being sold on the web for less than 30 Australian dollars, or around $23.   Experts say that private industry has been one of the most glaring vulnerabilities in Australia's cybersecurity. Tuesday's report, the Australian Cyber Security Center Threat Report, noted that 734 private-sector systems of ''national interest'' were affected by cyberattacks last year.   ''Certain companies take cybersecurity quite seriously,'' said Alana Maurushat, academic co-director of the Cyberspace Law and Policy Center at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. ''But you have key industries to Australia who -- while there may not be the same media coverage -- you know through internal sources are being breached. Our mining industry has notoriously been rumored to have been breached by competitors.''   Ms. Maurushat said that Australia as a whole was not far behind the rest of the developed world's level of cybersecurity, but emphasized concerns about its private sector.   ''The crazy thing about this is that they don't even know that they've been breached,'' she said. ''There are certain breaches that occur, and there are studies on this, where sometimes someone would be on your system for almost a year, without the breach even being noticed. That's the stuff that keeps me up at night.''   A cybersecurity report released this year by Telstra, the country's dominant telecommunications company, said that 59 percent of surveyed companies in Australia had detected a security breach on at least a monthly basis. A similar number reported experiencing at least one ransomware attack. Over half of Australian organizations that came under such an attack paid the ransom, the report said.   Ms. Maurushat said that, in part, Australia's private-sector cybersecurity was lacking because of an acute shortage of skilled workers.   The government report also noted ''extensive'' state-sponsored activity against Australia's government, saying that its defense contractors continued to be targeted by foreign nations' cyberespionage efforts.   At a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Tehan said that the government was pivoting toward offensive capabilities to ''prevent and shut down safe havens for offshore cybercriminals.''   Last year, the Australian government blamed foreign actors for an attack on its online census portal.   ''The whole census thing -- that's an I.B.M. mistake,'' Ms. Maurushat said, referring to the technology company's contracting role in the census. ''That's not a government mistake, that's an industry mistake, from a company you wouldn't expect to make those errors.''   In a settlement over the census problems, I.B.M. paid the government about 30 million Australian dollars, or about $23 million.   Not unlike vaccines and herd immunity, Ms. Maurushat said, a government's cybersecurity is only as strong as those it chooses to share its data with.   When asked whether Australia's lagging digital infrastructure and poor internet speeds might have a detrimental effect on its security, Ms. Maurushat said that a beleaguered attempt to speed up Australia's internet, the National Broadband Network initiative, may prove to be a silver lining.   ''It's the opposite,'' she said, adding that hackers rely on fast internet speeds. ''So in some ways, if the N.B.N. is a disaster, it might be better for us.''     "
Former N.S.A. Employee Pleads Guilty,"BALTIMORE -- A former National Security Agency employee admitted on Friday that he had illegally taken from the agency classified documents believed to have subsequently been stolen from his home computer by hackers working for Russian intelligence. Nghia H. Pho, 67, of Ellicott City, Md., pleaded guilty to one count of willful retention of national defense information, an offense that carries a possible 10-year sentence. Prosecutors agreed not to seek more than eight years, however, and Mr. Pho's attorney, Robert C. Bonsib, will be free to ask for a more lenient sentence. He remains free while awaiting sentencing on April 6.    Mr. Pho had been charged in secret, though some news reports had given a limited description of the case. Officials unsealed the charges on Friday, resolving the long-running mystery of the defendant's identity.    Mr. Pho, who worked as a software developer for the N.S.A., was born in Vietnam but is a naturalized United States citizen. Prosecutors withheld from the public many details of his government work and of the criminal case against him, which is linked to a continuing investigation of Russian hacking.   But in court documents, prosecutors did disclose that he worked from 2006 to 2016 for the N.S.A.'s ''Tailored Access Operations.'' The unit, whose name has now been changed to Computer Network Operations, is the N.S.A.'s fastest-growing component. Its hackers break into foreign computer networks to gather intelligence, often leaving behind software implants that continue to collect documents and other data and forward it to the agency for months or years.   Prosecutors said that from 2010 until March 2015, Mr. Pho began removing classified documents and writings. He kept those materials, some in digital form, at his home in Maryland, according to prosecutors.   It appears he was charged in March 2015.   Mr. Pho is one of three N.S.A. workers to be charged in the past two years with mishandling classified information, a dismal record for an agency that is responsible for some of the government's most carefully guarded secrets.   The leaks have come to light as investigators scramble to trace the source of an even worse breach of N.S.A. security: the public release of the agency's hacking tools by a still-unidentified group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. Some of those tools have been subsequently used for ''ransomware'' attacks that shut down or disrupted businesses, hospitals, railways and other enterprises around the world this year.   Government officials, who would speak of the classified details of the case only on condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Pho took the classified documents home to help him rewrite his resume. But he had installed on his home computer antivirus software made by Kaspersky Lab, a top Russian software company, and Russian hackers are believed to have exploited the software to steal the documents, the officials said.   It is not clear whether anyone at Kaspersky Lab was aware of the document theft. The company has acknowledged finding N.S.A. hacking software on a customer's computer and removing it, but says the material was subsequently destroyed. It has denied that it works with Russian intelligence.   The sensitivity of the case was evident on Friday, when one courtroom official described the charges against Mr. Pho as ''super-sealed'' before the hearing. The aggressive hacking of American targets by the Russian government, including the Democratic National Committee during last year's election campaign, is a high-priority concern for the United States, and forensic information from Mr. Pho's computer might provide useful clues.   In addition to Mr. Pho, an N.S.A. contractor, Harold T. Martin III, was arrested last year after F.B.I. agents found some 50 terabytes of data and documents that he had taken from the N.S.A. and other agencies over 20 years. The material was stuffed into a garden shed and car, among other places, and investigators have considered the possibility that the Shadow Brokers might have obtained the hacking tools from Mr. Martin, who had also worked at one point for agency's Tailored Access Operations.   A contract linguist who worked for the N.S.A. in Georgia, Reality Winner, was arrested in June and charged with providing a single N.S.A. document to the online publication The Intercept. Both Mr. Martin and Ms. Winner are being held awaiting trial.     "
Hacks Raise Fear Of N.S.A. ARSENAL,"Twice in the past month, National Security Agency cyberweapons stolen from its arsenal have been turned against two very different partners of the United States -- Britain and Ukraine. The N.S.A. has kept quiet, not acknowledging its role in developing the weapons. White House officials have deflected many questions, and responded to others by arguing that the focus should be on the attackers themselves, not the manufacturer of their weapons.    But the silence is wearing thin for victims of the assaults, as a series of escalating attacks using N.S.A. cyberweapons have hit hospitals, a nuclear site and American businesses. Now there is growing concern that United States intelligence agencies have rushed to create digital weapons that they cannot keep safe from adversaries or disable once they fall into the wrong hands.   On Wednesday, the calls for the agency to address its role in the latest attacks grew louder, as victims and technology companies cried foul. Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat and a former Air Force officer who serves on the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committees, urged the N.S.A. to help stop the attacks and to stop hoarding knowledge of the computer vulnerabilities upon which these weapons rely.    In an email on Wednesday evening, Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House, noted that the government ''employs a disciplined, high-level interagency decision-making process for disclosure of known vulnerabilities'' in software, ''unlike any other country in the world.''   Mr. Anton said the administration ''is committed to responsibly balancing national security interests and public safety and security,'' but declined to comment ''on the origin of any of the code making up this malware.''   Beyond that, the government has blamed others. Two weeks ago, the United States -- through the Department of Homeland Security -- said it had evidence North Korea was responsible for a wave of attacks in May using ransomware called WannaCry that shut down hospitals, rail traffic and production lines. The attacks on Tuesday against targets in Ukraine, which spread worldwide, appeared more likely to be the work of Russian hackers, though no culprit has been formally identified.   In both cases, the attackers used hacking tools that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft software. The tools were stolen from the N.S.A., and a group called the Shadow Brokers made them public in April. The group first started offering N.S.A. weapons for sale in August, and recently even offered to provide N.S.A. exploits to paid monthly subscribers.   Though the identities of the Shadow Brokers remain a mystery, former intelligence officials say there is no question from where the weapons came: a unit deep within the agency that was until recently called ''Tailored Access Operations.''   While the government has remained quiet, private industry has not. Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said outright that the National Security Agency was the source of the ''vulnerabilities'' now wreaking havoc and called on the agency to ''consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.''   For the American spy agency, which has invested billions of dollars developing an arsenal of weapons that have been used against the Iranian nuclear program, North Korea's missile launches and Islamic State militants, what is unfolding across the world amounts to a digital nightmare. It was as if the Air Force lost some of its most sophisticated missiles and discovered an adversary was launching them against American allies -- yet refused to respond, or even to acknowledge that the missiles were built for American use.   Officials fret that the potential damage from the Shadow Brokers leaks could go much further, and the agency's own weaponry could be used to destroy critical infrastructure in allied nations or in the United States.   ''Whether it's North Korea, Russia, China, Iran or ISIS, almost all of the flash points out there now involve a cyber element,'' Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary and Central Intelligence Agency chief said in a recent interview, before the weapons were turned against American interests.   ''I'm not sure we understand the full capability of what can happen, that these sophisticated viruses can suddenly mutate into other areas you didn't intend, more and more,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''That's the threat we're going to face in the near future.''   Using the remnants of American weapons is not entirely new. Elements of Stuxnet, the computer worm that disabled the centrifuges used in Iran's nuclear weapons program seven years ago, have been incorporated in some attacks.   In the past two months, attackers have retrofitted the agency's more recent weapons to steal credentials from American companies. Cybercriminals have used them to pilfer digital currency. North Korean hackers are believed to have used them to obtain badly needed currency from easy hacking targets like hospitals in England and manufacturing plants in Japan.   And on Tuesday, on the eve of Ukraine's Constitution Day -- which commemorates the country's first constitution after breaking away from the Soviet Union -- attackers used N.S.A.-developed techniques to freeze computers in Ukrainian hospitals, supermarkets, and even the systems for radiation monitoring at the old Chernobyl nuclear plant.   The so-called ransomware that gained the most attention in the Ukraine attack is believed to have been a smoke screen for a deeper assault aimed at destroying victims' computers entirely. And while WannaCry had a kill switch that was used to contain it, the attackers hitting Ukraine made sure there was no such mechanism. They also ensured that their code could infect computers that had received software patches intended to protect them.   ''You're seeing a refinement of these capabilities, and it only heads in one direction,'' said Robert Silvers, the former assistant secretary of cyber policy at the Department of Homeland Security, now a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings.   Though the original targets of Tuesday's attacks appear to have been government agencies and businesses in Ukraine, the attacks inflicted enormous collateral damage, taking down some 2,000 global targets in more than 65 countries, including Merck, the American drug giant, Maersk, the Danish shipping company, and Rosneft, the Russian state owned energy giant. The attack so crippled operations at a subsidiary of Federal Express that trading had to be briefly halted for FedEx stock.   ''When these viruses fall into the wrong hands, people can use them for financial gain, or whatever incentive they have -- and the greatest fear is one of miscalculation, that something unintended can happen,'' Mr. Panetta said.   Mr. Panetta was among the officials warning years ago of a ''cyber Pearl Harbor'' that could bring down the American power grid. But he and others never imagined that those same enemies might use the N.S.A.'s own cyberweapons.   For the past six years, government officials were comforted by the fact that their most fervent adversaries -- North Korea, Iran, extremist groups -- did not have the skills or digital tools to inflict major damage. The bigger cyberpowers, Russia and China in particular, seemed to exercise some restraint, though Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election added a new, more subtle threat.   But armed with the N.S.A.'s own tools, the limits are gone.   ''We now have actors, like North Korea and segments of the Islamic State, who have access to N.S.A. tools who don't care about economic and other ties between nation states,'' said Jon Wellinghoff, the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.   So long as flaws in computer code exist to create openings for digital weapons and spy tools, security experts say, the N.S.A. is not likely to stop hoarding software vulnerabilities any time soon.     "
U.S. Accuses North Korea of Cyberattack on British Health System,"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration formally accused North Korea on Monday night of creating the WannaCry cyberattack that briefly paralyzed the British health system and placed ransomware on computers in dozens of countries around the world. President Trump's homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, wrote in an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal that the conclusion was ''based on evidence'' that he did not disclose. He suggested that the United States would act against North Korea -- beyond the sanctions now being imposed for its rapid expansion of its nuclear weapons program, writing, ''When we must, the U.S. will act alone to impose costs and consequences for cybermalfeasance.''    The conclusion was not by itself a surprise: The New York Times reported in May that North Korea was the leading suspect in the attack, which encrypted hard drives on hundreds of thousands of computers and demanded the payment of ransom to unlock the data. Later, British officials reported that their forensic evidence and intelligence pointed to Pyongyang, and Mr. Bossert wrote that in recent days, Microsoft and other companies that track major threats have closed pathways that the North's army of hackers could use for similar breaches.    Still, the assertion by the administration, which officials said would be supported at a White House news conference on Tuesday, was notable for three reasons.   It came almost three years to the week since President Barack Obama, appearing in the White House press room, accused North Korea's leadership of mounting a similarly sophisticated cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. The North was enraged that Sony was releasing a comedy, ''The Interview,'' envisioning a C.I.A.-ordered assassination of Kim Jong-un, the country's young leader. That was the first time the United States had accused another nation of a direct, destructive online intrusion on an American target.   But the decision to name the North also stands in stark contrast to how Mr. Trump has dealt with evidence that Russian hackers, under orders from President Vladimir V. Putin, organized the attack on the Democratic National Committee and the information warfare campaign that was meant to influence the 2016 election. Mr. Trump has often dismissed the intelligence finding that Russia was behind the hacking, declaring last month, ''Putin said he did not do what they said he did.''   It is the same intelligence agencies -- and some of the government's same experts -- that built the case against North Korea, according to members of the intelligence community who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation.   But the third, and perhaps most delicate, element of the WannaCry attack revolves around a fact that Mr. Bossert did not address in his op-ed: The North exploited vulnerabilities in software developed by the division of the National Security Agency that builds the United States' cyberweapons. The code pulled off networks and computers compromised by WannaCry appears to have its roots in what the agency formerly called the Tailored Access Operations division, which devised online breaches.   Once it was clear the code had been stolen, the National Security Agency rushed to contain the damage, asking Microsoft to build a ''patch'' in its operating systems to prevent the attacks. But the agency has never talked about the group that stole the computer code, called the Shadow Brokers, which many officials believe is operating on behalf of the Russian government. But Mr. Bossert and his deputy, Rob Joyce, who formerly ran the Tailored Access Operations, have argued that it is the perpetrator of the attacks, not the United States government, that must take all of the responsibility for the damage it has wreaked.   ''The consequences and repercussions of WannaCry were beyond economic,'' Mr. Bossert wrote. ''The malicious software hit computers in the U.K.'s health care sector particularly hard, compromising systems that perform critical work. These disruptions put lives at risk.''   The assertion by the White House came only hours after Mr. Trump published his new national security strategy, which calls for pushing back on states that sponsor cyberactivity. And even some alumni of the Obama administration now agree that they often underreacted to a range of digital threats, including Iran's 2012 attacks on American banks, the hacking at Sony and the effort by Russia to intervene in the election. Until now, North Korea's cyberstrikes have prompted almost no punishment.   Mr. Bossert seems determined to change that, and he wrote about elements of a new digital strategy that suggests that the Trump administration will be more aggressive in alerting manufacturers to flaws found in their software. But he has been vague about what kind of actions might be taken against those who initiate cyberattacks.   Robert Hannigan, the former director of Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, said last month that in the realm of digital breaches, North Korea had benefited from being underestimated.   ''Because they are such a mix of the weird and absurd and medieval and highly sophisticated, people didn't take it seriously,'' he said. ''How can such an isolated, backward country have this capability? Well, how can such an isolated backward country have this nuclear ability?''

"In Computer Attacks, Clues Point To Frequent Culprit: North Korea","SAN FRANCISCO -- Intelligence officials and private security experts say that new digital clues point to North Korean-linked hackers as likely suspects in the sweeping ransomware attacks that have crippled computer systems around the world. The indicators are far from conclusive, the researchers warned, and it could be weeks, if not months, before investigators are confident enough in their findings to officially point the finger at Pyongyang's increasingly bold corps of digital hackers. The attackers based their weapon on vulnerabilities that were stolen from the National Security Agency and published last month.    Security experts at Symantec, which in the past has accurately identified attacks mounted by the United States, Israel and North Korea, found early versions of the ransomware, called WannaCry, that used tools that were also deployed against Sony Pictures Entertainment, the Bangladesh central bank last year and Polish banks in February. American officials said Monday that they had seen the same similarities.   All of those attacks were ultimately linked to North Korea; President Barack Obama formally charged the North in late 2014 with destroying computers at Sony in retaliation for a comedy, ''The Interview,'' that envisioned a C.I.A. plot to kill Kim Jong-un, the country's leader.    The computer code used in the ransomware bore some striking similarities to the code used in those three attacks. That code has not been widely used, and has been seen only in attacks by North Korean-linked hackers. Researchers at Google and Kaspersky, a Moscow-based cybersecurity firm, confirmed the coding similarities.   Those clues alone are not definitive, however. Hackers often borrow and retrofit one another's attack methods, and government agencies are known to plant ''false flags'' in their code to throw off forensic investigators.   ''At this time, all we have is a temporal link,'' said Eric Chien, an investigator at Symantec who was among the first to identify the Stuxnet worm, the American- and Israeli-led attacks on Iran's nuclear program, and North Korea's effort to steal millions from the Bangladeshi bank. ''We want to see more coding similarities,'' he said, ''to give us more confidence.''   The new leads about the source of the attacks came as technology executives raised an alarm about another feature of the attacks: They were based on vulnerabilities in Microsoft systems that were found by the N.S.A. and apparently stolen from it.   In a blog post on Microsoft's website over the weekend, Brad Smith, the company's president, asked what would happen if the United States military lost control of ''some of its Tomahawk missiles'' and discovered that a criminal group was using them to threaten a damaging strike. It was a potent analogy, and an unusually public airing of the newest split in the Silicon Valley-Washington divide.   Over the past few months, it has become clear that the intelligence community's version of Tomahawks -- the ''vulnerabilities'' the N.S.A. and C.I.A. have spent billions of dollars to develop to break into foreign computers and foil Iranian nuclear programs or North Korean missiles -- are being turned against everyday computer users around the world.   ''We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the C.I.A. show up on WikiLeaks,'' Mr. Smith wrote, ''and now this vulnerability stolen from the N.S.A. has affected customers around the world.''   The N.S.A.'s tools were published last month by a hacking group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which enabled hackers to bake them into their ransomware, which then spread rapidly through unpatched Microsoft computers, locking up everything in its wake.   There is no evidence that the North Koreans were involved in the actual theft of the N.S.A. hacking tools. There are many theories, but the favorite hypothesis among intelligence officials is that an insider, probably a contractor, stole the information, much as Edward J. Snowden lifted a different trove of information from the N.S.A. four years ago.   But hackers quickly seized on the published vulnerabilities to wreak havoc on computer systems that were not ''patched'' in recent months, after the N.S.A. quietly told Microsoft about the flaw in their systems. The damage wreaked in recent days could well escalate into the billions of dollars, security experts say, particularly now that any criminal, terrorist or nation state has the ability to tease the tools apart and retrofit them into their own hacking tools.   Not surprisingly, government officials say it is not entirely their fault. They will not confirm or deny what Mr. Smith says outright: That these ''vulnerabilities'' come out of America's growing cyberarsenal. At a news conference at the White House on Monday, Thomas Bossert, President Trump's Homeland Security adviser, told reporters, ''This was not an exploit developed by the N.S.A. to hold organizations ransom,'' he said. ''This was a vulnerability exploit that was part of a much larger tool put together by the culpable parties.''   ''The provenance of the underlying vulnerability is not of as much concern to me,'' Mr. Bossert said, stepping around the delicate question of the N.S.A.'s role.   The weapons used in the attacks that started Friday, government officials insist, were cobbled together from many sources. And the fault, they argue, lies with whoever turned them into weapons -- or maybe with Microsoft itself, for not having a system in place to make sure that when they issue a patch that neutralizes such attacks, everyone around the world takes the time to fix their systems. Or with the victims, who failed to run their security updates made available two months ago, or who continue to use so-called ''legacy'' software that Microsoft no longer supports.   When asked about the source of the attack, Mr. Bossert said on Monday, ''We don't know.'' He told reporters at the White House. ''Attribution can be difficult. I don't want to say we have no clues. But I stand assured that the best and brightest are working on this hack.''   As Mr. Bossert was speaking to reporters, yet another N.S.A. hacking tool, very similar to the one used in the weekend's ransomware attacks, was being retrofitted by cybercriminals and put up for sale on the underground dark web. In private hacking forums, cybercriminals were discussing how to develop more than a dozen other N.S.A. hacking tools for criminal use.   Another round of attacks using the N.S.A. tools could well affect another big issue that the Obama administration debated and never resolved when it left office: whether the government can demand that all companies assure that investigators can ''unlock'' encrypted communications. Before he was fired last week, James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, often complained that the government was ''going dark,'' and that intelligence agencies and local police departments needed a way to crack the encrypted mobile conversations of terrorists or kidnappers.   But the N.S.A.'s loss of its own hacking tools has undercut that argument, executives say. If the N.S.A. and the C.I.A. cannot keep their hacking tools locked up, companies like Apple are asking, why should Americans trust them with the keys to unlock every private communication and bank transfer? Won't those leak, too, meaning that hackers, blackmailers and thieves will all have access to everyone's private email, health records and financial transactions?   Nine years ago, the White House created a process for deciding what unpatched holes to disclose to manufacturers like Microsoft and its competitors, and which to keep in its arsenal.   That process was refined by Mr. Obama and in 2015, Adm. Michael Rogers, the director of the NSA, said the agency had shared 91 percent of the zero-days it had discovered that year. A zero-day is a previously undisclosed flaw that leaves computer users with zero days to fix the vulnerability.   But Michael Daniel, the White House cybercoordinator in the Obama administration, noted, ''We still don't have a good rating system for vulnerabilities in terms of their severity. Not all zero-days are created equal,'' he said.   The N.S.A.'s wormlike tool was leaked online by the Shadow Brokers last month.   ''What happened with the Shadow Brokers in this case is equivalent to a nuclear bomb in cyberspace,'' said Zohar Pinhasi, a former cybersecurity intelligence officer for the Israeli military, now the chief executive of MonsterCloud, which helps mitigate ransomware attacks. ''This is what happens when you give a tiny little criminal a weapon of mass destruction. This will only go bigger. It's only the tip of the iceberg.''

Ransomware Attack Refocuses a Light on an Old Problem for Microsoft: Security,"SEATTLE -- When malicious software first became a serious problem on the internet about 15 years ago, most people agreed that the biggest villain, after the authors of the damaging code, was Microsoft. As a new cyberattack continues to sweep across the globe, the company is once again at the center of the debate over who is to blame for a vicious strain of malware demanding ransom from victims in exchange for the unlocking of their digital files.    This time, though, Microsoft believes others should share responsibility for the attack, an assault that targeted flaws in the Windows operating system.    On Sunday, Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, wrote a blog post describing the company's efforts to stop the ransomware's spread, including an unusual step it took to release a security update for versions of Windows that Microsoft no longer supports. Mr. Smith wrote, ''As a technology company, we at Microsoft have the first responsibility to address these issues.''   He went on, though, to emphasize that the attack had demonstrated the ''degree to which cybersecurity has become a shared responsibility between tech companies and customers,'' the latter of whom must update their systems if they want to be protected. He also pointed his finger at intelligence services, since the latest vulnerability appeared to have been leaked from the National Security Agency.   On Monday, a Microsoft spokesman declined to comment beyond Mr. Smith's post.   To prepare for fallout with customers, Judson Althoff, a Microsoft executive vice president, sent an email to the company's field sales team on Sunday encouraging them to be supportive of businesses targeted by the attack, or even those who were simply aware of it.   ''Our key direction to you is to remember that we are in this with our customers -- we are trusted advisers, counselors, and suppliers to them,'' he wrote. ''More than technical guidance, I want you to make sure you are spending the time needed to understand the concerns they have and that they know we are here to help.''   While Microsoft's reputation has suffered in the past because of security problems, the company's stock is barely down from the close of trading on Thursday, just before reports of the ransomware.   ''People have extremely short memories when it comes to this,'' said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research. ''I think, realistically, people will move on pretty quickly.''   Microsoft has recognized the risk that cybersecurity poses to it since about 2002, when Bill Gates, the former chief executive, issued a call to arms inside the company after a wave of malicious software began infecting Windows PCs connected to the internet.   ''As software has become ever more complex, interdependent and interconnected, our reputation as a company has in turn become more vulnerable,'' Mr. Gates wrote in an email to employees identifying trustworthy computing as Microsoft's top priority. ''Flaws in a single Microsoft product, service or policy not only affect the quality of our platform and services overall, but also our customers' view of us as a company.''   Since then, the company has poured billions of dollars into security initiatives, employing more than 3,500 engineers dedicated to security. In March, it released a software patch that addressed the vulnerability exploited by the ransomware, known as WannaCry, protecting systems such as Windows 10, its latest operating system.   Yet security flaws in older editions of Windows persist. The company no longer provides regular software updates to Windows XP, a version first released in 2001, unless customers pay for ''custom support,'' a practice some observers believe has put users at risk. Late Friday, Microsoft took the unusual step of making patches that protect older systems against WannaCry, including Windows XP, free.   ''Companies like Microsoft should discard the idea that they can abandon people using older software,'' Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the school of information and library science at the University of North Carolina, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece over the weekend. ''The money they made from these customers hasn't expired; neither has their responsibility to fix defects.''   But security experts challenged that argument, saying that Microsoft could not be expected to keep updating old software products indefinitely. Providing updates to older systems could make computers more insecure by removing an incentive for users to modernize, Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer of F-Secure, a security firm.   ''I can understand why they issued an emergency patch for XP after WannaCry was found, but in general, we should just let XP die, '' Mr. Hypponen said.   Despite the high profile of WannaCry, widespread malware outbreaks have become less common over the years, as Microsoft has improved the security of its systems, said Ziv Mador, vice president for security research at Trustwave, a security services firm. But the profits that criminals can make through ransomware and other malicious code ensure the problem will never vanish.   ''Even though it's becoming harder and harder, the incentives have increased tremendously,'' said Mr. Mador, who previously worked on security response at Microsoft.     "
"Attackers May Seek Ukrainian Chaos, Not Cash","Follow Andrew E. Kramer on Twitter @AndrewKramerNYT . KIEV, Ukraine -- The day started like most for Roman N. Klimenko, an accountant in Kiev who had just settled in at his desk, typing at a computer keyboard and drinking coffee. He was unaware that concealed within his tax preparation software lurked a ticking bomb. That bomb soon exploded, destroying his financial data and quickly spreading through computer systems vital to Ukraine's government -- and beyond. The cyberattack, on Tuesday, was caused by a virus similar to one that wreaked global havoc less than two months ago.    Both had the appearance of hacker blackmail assaults known as ransomware attacks: screens of infected computers warn users their data will be destroyed unless ransoms are paid.   But in Ukraine's case, a more sinister motive -- paralysis of the country's vital computer systems -- may have been the motive, cybersecurity experts said on Wednesday. And many Ukrainians cast their suspicions on Russia.    Cybersecurity experts based their reasoning partly on having identified the group of Ukrainian users who were initially and improbably targeted: tax accountants.   All are required by law to use a tax preparation software such as that made by a Ukrainian company, M.E.Doc. The software that runs on Microsoft Windows-based computers was recently updated. Microsoft issued a statement on Wednesday saying it ''now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate M.E.Doc updater process.''   Cybersecurity experts said that whoever launched the assault -- on the eve of a holiday celebrating Ukrainian independence -- must have known that M.E.Doc software, which is integrated into Ukrainian government computers, was their gateway.   ''You don't hit the day before Constitution Day for no reason,'' said Craig Williams, the senior technical researcher with the Talos division of Cisco, the American technology company, which helped pinpoint the origin of the Tuesday attack.   Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and computer operations at Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, the country's equivalent to the National Security Agency, said, ''This isn't about the money.''   ''This attack is about disabling how large companies and governments can operate,'' he added. ''You get a double whammy of the initial cyberattack and then organizations being forced to shut down their operations.''   For Mr. Klimenko, the software update seemed to go fine -- until hours later. ''The screen became red,'' he said in an interview. ''A warning appeared, and everything on the hard drive was scrambled.''   Mr. Klimenko quickly realized he had lost all past-year filings, a catastrophe for an accountant. ''Now I cannot confirm that I filed,'' he said. ''Honestly, I don't understand what happened.''   Yet to be determined is the source of the virus. But Russia was seen as the prime suspect because it has been engaged in overt and covert warfare with Ukraine since the 2014 revolution that deposed a Kremlin-friendly government. A Russian role has yet to be proven and may never be. Nevertheless, analysts said on Wednesday that if the attackers' object was to sow chaos at the highest levels in Ukraine, M.E.Doc provided an ideal way. Its software is not only widely installed at government agencies and banks, but is mandatory at many Ukrainian businesses and government agencies.   M.E.Doc said in a statement that it could not confirm whether the virus had been distributed through the update, but that it was ''cooperating with Ukraine's cyberpolice on the investigation.''   In another indication that Ukraine was a prime target, the national police said on Wednesday that more than 1,500 companies had filed complaints or appealed for help because of computer intrusions. That was far more than in other countries, although Russia seemed to be the second-most widely affected.   While analysts remained cautious about assigning blame, there was little reticence in official circles in Ukraine, particularly as it became clear that the country was the primary target. The timing was an especially clear sign of political intent, they said.   Adding to their suspicions, just a few hours before the computer strike, a Ukrainian military intelligence officer, Maksim Shapoval, was killed by a car bomb in Kiev. It was the latest in a string of assassinations of opponents and critics of Russia in the Ukrainian capital.   ''War in cyberspace, seeding fear and horror among millions of personal computer users, and inflicting direct material damage from destabilizing the work of businesses and the state, is just one part of the hybrid war of the Russian empire against Ukraine,'' Anton Gerashenko, a member of Parliament, wrote on Facebook. The assassination of Mr. Shapoval is another, he wrote. Mr. Gerashenko called the spread of the virus the ''most massive computer attack in the history of Ukraine.'' He said it was only ''masked as an effort to extort money from computer users,'' with the real goal economic disruption.   In this view, what began as a strike at Ukraine later and perhaps inadvertently spread to other countries merely as collateral damage.   The timing of the attack was suspect in another way, coming after a rare stretch of upbeat news in Ukraine. Last week, the European Union waived visa requirements for Ukrainians, at least those few fortunate enough to have the means to travel. That was a euphoric moment for many Ukrainians, some of whom could be seen celebrating with raised fists after gliding through immigration lanes in European airports.   President Petro O. Poroshenko met in Washington with President Trump, undermining what politicians here say is an overarching Russian goal of weakening Ukraine by highlighting the incompetence and corruption of the government.   The attack also comes in the context of a long-running trade war between Russia and Ukraine, on the sidelines of the actual shooting war in eastern Ukraine between the government and Russian-backed separatists.   In recent months, the authorities in Kiev have banned Russian software imports and blocked coal shipments from areas under rebel control. The coal embargo cut off a vital financial lifeline in the east, forcing Russia to take some of the coal.   The police have established a computer headquarters with the domestic intelligence agency, the S.B.U., and Cisco to analyze the attack in hopes of tying it to Russia. Though cybersecurity experts have not linked the malware to any particular state or criminal group, a Russian computer attack targeting Ukraine's economy would be consistent with the recent economic skirmishing, analysts say.   ''If you look at Ukrainian cyberspace, M.E.Doc is an excellent carrier for a virus,'' Ivan Lozowy, director of the Institute of Statehood and Democracy, said in a telephone interview. The software is used by businesses large and small, and it can transmit a virus to government computers, where it is designed to file returns. ''The Russians are interested in Ukraine having as many problems as possible,'' he said.     "
Maker of 'Smart' Vibrators Settles Data Collection Lawsuit for $3.75 Million,"Forget about prying microwaves. The real spies might be sex toys. That, at least, was a claim made by two plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in Chicago against Standard Innovation, a Canadian manufacturer of ''smart'' vibrators that allow users to remotely ''turn on your lover'' via a Bluetooth connection.    The class action came after two hackers demonstrated in a hacking conference last year that it was possible to remotely take control of the vibrator and activate it.    The company agreed this week to pay $3.75 million to settle the suit, which alleged that the firm violated privacy by accessing personal information. Under the terms of the settlement, Standard Innovation will also stop recording users' personal information and destroy any collected data.   To use the We-Vibe vibrator's full range of features and customized vibrations, including text and chat features, users were required to download the We-Connect mobile app from the Apple Store or Google Play. Once the app was installed and linked to the vibrator, consumers could use their smartphone to remotely access and control it, according to the company.   ''The usage information collected by Standard Innovation through We-Connect is extraordinarily intimate and private,'' according to court documents from the plaintiffs. The two lead plaintiffs were anonymous, including an Illinois woman identified as N.P. who said she bought a $130 We-Vibe Rave and downloaded the app but was never warned about the data collection, The Chicago Tribune reported.   ''Standard Innovation collected individual-level usage information -- often tied to users' personally identifiable addresses,'' they said, adding that the firm ''breached its customers' trust, devalued their purchases'' and '' violated federal and state law in the process.''   About 300,000 people purchased We-Vibe devices covered by the class action, and about 100,000 downloaded and used the app, according to a memo filed with the settlement agreement.   The security and data collection issues came to light last year at the Def Con hackers' conference in Las Vegas during a talk called ''Hacking the Vibrating Internet of Things,'' by two hackers, The Guardian reported in August.    ''A lot of people in the past have said it's not really a serious issue,'' one of the hackers, who goes by @Followr on Twitter, told the conference. ''But if you come back to the fact that we're talking about people, unwanted activation of a vibrator is potentially sexual assault.'' His co-presenter was @g0ldfisk. They estimated that Standard Innovation had about two million customers for its products.   In the settlement, the company denied any wrongdoing.   ''At Standard Innovation we take customer privacy and data security seriously,'' a spokesman, Denny Alexander, said in an email on Tuesday, calling the settlement ''fair and reasonable.''   In September, he said, ''we responded rapidly to concerns about app privacy and security. We enhanced our privacy notice, increased app security, provided customers more choice in the data they share, and we continue to work with leading privacy and security experts to improve the app.''   This latest class action reflects growing concerns over internet-connected ''smart'' products in the home that can get, well, too smart. A string of reports in recent years about hackers targeting and remotely controlling items like baby monitors have raised alarm. And numerous experiments by researchers have shown how easy it is to hack into cars, medical devices and even dolls.   Last month, German regulators announced that they were banning sales of Cayla, a doll made by U.S.-based Genesis Toys, because they said hackers could use it to steal personal data by recording private conversations over an insecure Bluetooth connection.   The doll is also under scrutiny in the United States, where advocacy groups filed a complaint with the toymaker in December, alleging that the company records and transmits the voice prints of children to a software company.

"Lost in the Tweets, Some Decent Ideas","Complaining that nobody pays attention to its policy initiatives, the White House carved last month into four thematic weeks -- Infrastructure Week, Workforce Development Week, Technology Week and Energy Week. You're forgiven if you didn't notice. Kellyanne Conway's claims to the contrary, it's hard to pay attention to ''finer policy points'' when their purpose is less to enunciate policy than to distract from Russia investigations, ''die-in'' protests against the health care bills, provocations by North Korea and all those presidential tweets. Nonetheless, after digging through June's pronouncements and bullet points, and consulting the White House, its allies and its critics, we found a few promising ideas amid the blather, as well as some old clunkers.     Week One: Infrastructure. A great idea, stalled on the runway. Even the hulking coal barges behind Mr. Trump as he made a ''major'' infrastructure speech on June 7 couldn't hide that his biggest job-creation promise, a $1 trillion infrastructure overhaul, has fallen prey to his inattentiveness, a congressional logjam, Republicans' worries about costs and their aversion to working with Democrats on most anything.   Week Two: Workforce Development. Mr. Trump wants to expand vocational school, job training and apprenticeship opportunities to fill a deep gap in the manufacturing, health care, technology and construction labor pools. In a March hearing on Capitol Hill, a construction executive said that while activity is on par with 2007, there are 100,000 fewer skilled workers. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in June directing the labor secretary to channel available money toward programs that provide paying jobs with a training or educational component. It's not a fully formed plan, but it's a solid effort to address a recognized need.   Ivanka Trump again promoted her plan for six weeks of paid family leave. Democrats say it's not enough; Republicans recoil at government-funded family leave. She gets credit for pushing Republicans to consider an overdue idea, but it's unclear that she has the commitment and experience to win them over.   Week Three: Technology. Jared Kushner, the son-in-law whose packed portfolio includes the Office of American Innovation, updated tech executives on progress in modernizing the government's technology infrastructure. Once the cameras were off, the chief executives stressed that cybersecurity and system modernization go hand in hand, and have been a priority at least since the Office of Personnel Management data hack during the Obama administration. They established a working group of experts from two dozen companies, which this week began drawing up recommendations for replacing antiquated government computer systems with secure networks. The project has bipartisan support in Congress. (Read: It might actually get funded.)   Week Four: Energy. Lots of chest pounding by Mr. Trump and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke about ''energy dominance'' and the need to extract even more of what America already has in abundance -- oil and natural gas -- with little attention to further developing carbon-free energy sources like wind and solar. On the plus side, the president promised to ''revive and expand our nuclear energy sector.'' Affordable, next-generation nuclear facilities would be a powerful weapon in the battle against climate change. For the most part, however, the administration's ideas were Bush-Cheney ghosts come to life, not least the infatuation with drilling in vulnerable areas of the Arctic.   In general, this administration has been far more adept at dismantling the policies of its predecessor than at fostering innovative ideas of its own. Most of Mr. Trump's early ''policy'' moves have consisted of sweeping regulatory rollbacks, and many of the most damaging of these face court challenges. Hence the White House staff's effort to keep the president off Twitter and create bandwidth for a few solid ideas that, with further work and persistence, could bear fruit. The hardest part might be securing reliable support, and sustained attention to them, from Mr. Trump himself.

Tech Roundup: WikiLeaks Documents Point to Scourge of Cyberweapons,"Documents released by WikiLeaks that indicate the extensive collection of cyberweapons by the C.I.A. are a reminder that this sort of thing is a growing international business. On Tuesday, WikiLeaks released a huge cache of documents that detail how the C.I.A. has collected various types of cyberweapons, including so-called zero-day vulnerabilities that would expose iPhones, Android phones, Windows and Linux computers, internet-connected televisions and maybe even high-tech cars to hackers.     The argument for the C.I.A. gathering these hacking tools would be that they are needed to counter the increasing technological sophistication of its targets. What's more, by targeting the underlying software of a smartphone, the agency would be able to capture communications before they were encrypted by popular communications programs like Signal.   It's not yet clear how the C.I.A. obtained the malware, and at least some of it may be out of date. (Hint: Upgrade your phone's software.) Some may have been discovered by government researchers. And many others may have been acquired in the growing online market for this troublesome code.   Over the last year, The New York Times's Nicole Perlroth has written extensively about cyberarms dealers. Whether it is through online brokerages, physical conferences or contracts obtained by companies based in Israel, Italy and other places, governments around the world have been spending big to obtain these hacking tools.   As Ms. Perlroth reported late last year: ''Zerodium, a zero-day-exploit broker that sells to governments, said it paid hackers $1 million for an Apple exploit in October. In mid-November, the brokerage firm said it would pay hackers $50,000 for an attack that could take over a victim's machine through a Safari or Internet Explorer browser, and $80,000 for a similar attack through Google's Chrome browser.''   More tech news:   Snap makes a bet on the supremacy of the camera: Our rising dependence on cameras is changing our language, and the company behind Snapchat is counting on the eventual dominance of visual culture.   A billion-dollar fine for ZTE of China: The technology company agreed to plead guilty to charges that it broke United States sanctions and sold electronics to Iran and North Korea. The move offered a chance for President Trump's administration to make a statement about the seriousness of United States sanctions.   Jeff Bezos's moon shot gets its first paying customer:  The Amazon chief's rocket company, Blue Origin, announced that it will deliver a Eutelsat satellite to space, indicating its intention to become a full-fledged business.

Hackers Use Social Media As Way to Get Past Defenses,"SAN FRANCISCO -- It took only one attempt for Russian hackers to make their way into the computer of a Pentagon official. But the attack didn't come through an email or a file buried within a seemingly innocuous document. A link, attached to a Twitter post put out by a robot account, promised a family-friendly vacation package for the summer. It was the kind of thing anyone might click on, according to the official hit by the attack, who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.     That is exactly the problem, Pentagon officials and cybersecurity experts said. While corporations and government agencies around the world are training their staff to think twice before opening anything sent by email, hackers have already moved on to a new kind of attack, targeting social media accounts, where people are more likely to be trusting.   Pentagon officials are increasingly worried that state-backed hackers are using social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook to break into Defense Department computer networks. And the human error that causes people to click on a link sent to them in an email is exponentially greater on social media sites, the officials said, because people are more likely consider themselves among friends.   Once one person is compromised, attacks can move quickly through that person's friend network, leading to what the officials described as a nightmare situation in which entire departments at the Pentagon could be targeted. And while officials know about the problem, training about how to spot an attack that comes through Twitter and Facebook remains limited.   Another official, who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters, described the problem as teaching an entire department to be wary of anything that was sent to it -- even if the message appeared to come from family or a friend.   While last year's hacking of senior Democratic Party officials raised awareness of the damage caused if just a handful of employees click on the wrong emails, few people realize that a message on Twitter or Facebook could give an attacker similar access to their system and that accounts can be spoofed or imitated so it appears that attackers are a trusted friend.   ''Spear phishing,'' or the act of sending a malicious file or link through a seemingly innocuous message, is hardly new. In November 2015, the State Department revealed that its employees had been spear phished through social media accounts.   But Pentagon officials say the scale of the spear phishing attacks is unlike anything they had ever seen before. A report in Time magazine this month revealed that a Russian-led cyberattack tried to spear phish 10,000 Twitter accounts belonging to Defense Department employees, using personal messages targeted at specific users.   The Defense Department did not respond to a request for comment. In response to a Times reporter, Twitter sent a copy of the company's anti-spam rules, which said any account that violated its rules would be suspended. A spokesman for Facebook said the company was aware of the problem and was monitoring spear phishing on the platform.   In a recent white paper published by Facebook, the company outlined the common hacking it was seeing. The company said it was using specialized notifications, detection systems and user education to counteract spear fishing.   Cybersecurity companies said spear phishing through social media was one of the fastest-growing methods of attack.   ''It's something that you don't hear as much about, but the problem is pervasive,'' said Jay Kaplan, a former Defense Department cybersecurity expert and senior cyberanalyst at the National Security Agency who is now the chief executive of the cybersecurity company Synack. ''Social media gives a number of indicators to an attacker, on a state-sponsored level, that you couldn't get through email.''   Outside of simply using a spear phishing email to gain access to a network, attackers could use an account to gather intelligence. By watching a group of soldiers posting online, attackers could watch location changes to discern troop movements or engage directly in conversations to try to ferret out military decisions.   ''Most people don't think twice when they are posting on social media. They don't think about people using the information against them maliciously,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''They also don't assume people on their network might be attackers.''   According to a 2016 report by Verizon, roughly 30 percent of spear phishing emails are opened by their targets. But research published by the cybersecurity firm ZeroFOX showed that 66 percent of spear phishing messages sent through social media sites were opened by their intended victims.   In the Defense Department attack, for example, 7,000 employees took the first step toward being compromised by clicking on a link, said Evan Blair, a co-founder of ZeroFOX. ''The attacks are so much more successful because they use your personal timeline and the content you engaged with to target the message to you,'' Mr. Blair said.   Simply by looking at public posts, attackers can easily see if an account has mentioned a certain band or sports team often, then tailor a message pointing to tickets going on sale for an event. On Facebook, an attacker can see which groups have been joined, or which public pages have been liked.   In an experiment last year, ZeroFOX created an automated program that taught itself to send spear phishing links to Twitter users. Over two hours, the program sent link to 819 people, at a rate of roughly 6.75 messages per minute. Two hundred seventy five users opened the links.   Mr. Blair said that in the case of the Defense Department, the links had carried the malware. Once people clicked on the link, they were infecting their computer networks. In many cases, the attackers targeted members of Defense Department employees' families, who were less likely to be suspicious.   The Defense Department employee who told The Times that he had been part of the recent breach said he had been targeted through his wife's Twitter account. She was the one to click on a link to a vacation package, after exchanging messages with friends over what they should do with their children over the summer.   Once the hackers got into her computer, the official said, they got to his computer through a shared home network.     "
Google Is Hit by Nationwide Email Attack; What to Do if You're a Victim,"Google said it was investigating an email scam winding its way through inboxes across the country and had disabled the accounts responsible for the spam. The scheme emerged Wednesday afternoon, when spammers dispatched malicious email, appearing to come from people the recipients knew, beckoning them to click on what appeared to be a shared Google document.    Recipients who clicked on the links were prompted to give the sender access to their Google contact lists and Google Drive. In the process, victims allowed spammers to raid their contact lists and send even more email.    ''We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs,'' Google said statement posted on Twitter. ''We encourage you to not click through and report as phishing within Gmail.''   It is not clear who created the spam email or how many people it has affected.   In a second statement, on Wednesday evening, Google said that it had disabled the accounts responsible for the spam, updated its systems to block it and was working on ways to prevent such an attack from recurring.   If you receive suspicious email, here are some tips:   1. Do not click, even when the email is from your mother.   Even when you receive links from trusted contacts, be careful what you click. Spammers, cybercriminals and, increasingly, nation-state spies are resorting to basic email attacks, known as spear phishing, which bait victims into clicking on links that download malicious software, or lure them into turning over their user names and passwords.   A quarter of phishing attacks studied last year by Verizon were found to be nation-state spies trying to gain entry into their target's inboxes, up from the 9 percent of attacks reported in 2016.   In this case, the malicious emails all appeared to come from a contact, but were actually from the address ''hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com'' with recipients BCCed.   2. Turn on multifactor authentication.   Google and most other email, social media and banking services offer customers the ability to turn on multifactor authentication. Use it. When you log in from an unrecognized computer, the service will prompt you to enter a one-time code texted to your phone. It is the most basic way to prevent hackers from breaking into your accounts with a stolen password.   3. Shut it down.   If you accidentally clicked on the Google phishing attack and gave spammers third-party access to your Google account, you can revoke their access by following these steps:   Go to https://myaccount-google-com.ezproxy.lib.ryerson.ca/permissions   Revoke access to ''Google Docs'' (the app will have access to contacts and drive).   4. Change your passwords ... again.   If you've been phished, change your passwords to something you have never used before. Ideally, your passwords should be long and should not be words that could be found in a dictionary. The first things hackers do when breaking into a site is use computer programs that will try every word in the dictionary. Your email account is a ripe target for hackers because your inbox is the key to resetting the passwords of, and potentially breaking into, dozens of other accounts.   Make your password long and distinctive. Security specialists advise creating anagrams based on song lyrics, movie quotations or sayings. For example, ''The Godfather'' movie quotation ''Leave the gun. Take the cannoli,'' becomes LtG,tTcannol1.   5. Report it.   Report any phishing attacks to Google by clicking the downward arrow at the top right of your inbox and selecting ''Report Phishing.'' Companies count on those reports to investigate such scams and stop them.     "
"Hackers Came, But the French Were Prepared","PARIS -- Everyone saw the hackers coming. The National Security Agency in Washington picked up the signs. So did Emmanuel Macron's bare-bones technology team. And mindful of what happened in the American presidential campaign, the team created dozens of false email accounts, complete with phony documents, to confuse the attackers.    The Russians, for their part, were rushed and a bit sloppy, leaving a trail of evidence that was not enough to prove for certain they were working for the government of President Vladimir V. Putin but which strongly suggested they were part of his broader ''information warfare'' campaign.   The story told by American officials, cyberexperts and Mr. Macron's own campaign aides of how a hacking attack intended to disrupt the most consequential election in France in decades ended up a dud was a useful reminder that as effective as cyberattacks can be in disabling Iranian nuclear plants, or Ukrainian power grids, they are no silver bullet. The kind of information warfare favored by Russia can be defeated by early warning and rapid exposure.    But that outcome was hardly assured on Friday night, when what was described as a ''massive'' hacking attack suddenly put Mr. Macron's electoral chances in jeopardy. To French and American officials, however, it was hardly a surprise.   Testifying in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington on Tuesday, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, said American intelligence agencies had seen the attack unfolding, telling their French counterparts, ''Look, we're watching the Russians. We're seeing them penetrate some of your infrastructure. Here's what we've seen. What can we do to try to assist?''   But the staff at Mr. Macron's makeshift headquarters in the 15th Arrondissement at the edge of Paris didn't need the N.S.A. to tell them they were being targeted: In December, after the former investment banker and finance minister had emerged as easily the most anti-Russian, pro-NATO and pro-European Union candidate in the presidential race, they began receiving phishing emails.   The phishing mails were ''high quality,'' said Mr. Macron's digital director, Mounir Mahjoubi: They included the actual names of members of the campaign staff, and at first glance appeared to come from them. Typical was the very last one the campaign received, several days before the election on Sunday, which purported to have come from Mr. Mahjoubi himself.   ''It was almost like a joke, like giving us all the finger,'' Mr. Mahjoubi said in interview on Tuesday. The final email enjoined recipients to download several files ''to protect yourself.''   Even before then, the Macron campaign had begun looking for ways to make life a little harder for the Russians, showing a level of skill and ingenuity that was missing in Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and at the Democratic National Committee, which had minimal security protections and for months ignored F.B.I. warnings that its computer system had been penetrated.   ''We went on a counteroffensive,'' said Mr. Mahjoubi. ''We couldn't guarantee 100 percent protection'' from the attacks, ''so we asked: what can we do?'' Mr. Mahjoubi opted for a classic ''cyber-blurring'' strategy, well known to banks and corporations, creating false email accounts and filled them with phony documents the way a bank teller keeps fake bills in the cash drawer in case of a robbery.   ''We created false accounts, with false content, as traps. We did this massively, to create the obligation for them to verify, to determine whether it was a real account,'' Mr. Mahjoubi said. ''I don't think we prevented them. We just slowed them down,'' he said. ''Even if it made them lose one minute, we're happy,'' he said.   Mr. Mahjoubi refused to reveal the nature of the false documents that were created, or to say whether, in the Friday document dump that was the result of the hacking campaign, there were false documents created by the Macron campaign.   But he did note that in the mishmash that constituted the Friday dump, there were some authentic documents, some phony documents of the hackers' own manufacture, some stolen documents from various companies, and some false emails created by the campaign.   ''During all their attacks we put in phony documents. And that forced them to waste time,'' he said. ''By the quantity of the documents we put in,'' he added, ''and documents that might interest them.''   With only 18 people in the digital team, many of them occupied in producing campaign materials like videos, Mr. Mahjoubi hardly had the resources to track down the hackers. ''We didn't have time to try to catch them,'' he said. But he has his suspicions about their identity. Simultaneously with the phishing attacks, the Macron campaign was being attacked by the Russian media with a profusion of fake news.   Oddly, the Russians did a poor job of covering their tracks. That made it easier for private security firms, on alert after the efforts to manipulate the American election, to search for evidence.   In mid-March, researchers with Trend Micro, the cybersecurity giant based in Tokyo, watched the same Russian intelligence unit behind some of the Democratic National Committee hacks start building the tools to hack Mr. Macron's campaign. They set up web domains mimicking those of Mr. Macron's En Marche! Party, and began dispatching emails with malicious links and fake login pages designed to bait campaign staffers into divulging their usernames and passwords, or to click on a link that would give the Russians a toehold onto the campaign's network.   It was the classic Russian playbook, security researchers say, but this time the world was prepared. ''The only good news is that this activity is now commonplace, and the general population is so used to the idea of a Russian hand behind this, that it backfired on them,'' said John Hultquist, the director of cyberespionage analysis at FireEye, the Silicon Valley security firm.   Mr. Hultquist noted that the attack was characterized by haste, and a trail of digital mistakes. ''There was a time when Russian hackers were characterized by their lack of sloppiness,'' Mr. Hultquist said. ''When they made mistakes, they burned their entire operation and started anew. But since the invasion of Ukraine and Crimea,'' he said, ''we've seen them carry out brazen, large scale attacks,'' perhaps because ''there have been few consequences for their actions.''   The hackers also made the mistake of releasing information that was, by any campaign standard, pretty boring. The nine gigabytes worth of purportedly stolen emails and files from the Macron campaign was spun as scandalous material, but turned out to be almost entirely the humdrum of campaign workers trying to conduct ordinary life in the midst of the election maelstrom.   One of the leaked emails details a campaign staffer's struggle with a broken down car. Another documents how a campaign worker was reprimanded for failure to invoice a cup of coffee.   That is when the hackers got sloppy. The metadata tied to a handful of documents -- code that shows the origins of a document -- show some passed through Russian computers and were edited by Russian users. Some Excel documents were modified using software unique to Russian versions of Microsoft Windows.   Other documents had last been modified by Russian usernames, including one person that researchers identified as a 32-year-old employee of Eureka CJSC, based in Moscow, a Russian technology company that works closely with the Russian Ministry of Defense and intelligence agencies. The company has received licenses from Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, to help protect state secrets. The company did not return emails requesting comment.   Other leaked documents appear to have been forged, or faked. One purported to detail the purchase of the stimulant mephedrone, sometimes sold as ''bath salts,'' by a Macron campaign staffer who allegedly had the drugs shipped to the address of France's National Assembly. But Henk Van Ess, a member of the investigations team at Bellingcat, a British investigations organization, and others discovered that the transaction numbers in the receipt were not in the public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions.   ''It's clear they were rushed,'' Mr. Hultquist said. ''If this was APT28,'' he said, using the name for a Russian group believed to be linked to the GRU, a military intelligence agency, ''they have been caught in the act, and it has backfired for them.''   Now, he said, the failure of the Macron hacks could just push Russian hackers to improve their methods.   ''They may have to change their playbook entirely,'' Mr. Hultquist said.     "
Hacking Our Nuclear Weapons,"Bruce G. Blair, a research scholar in the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton, is a founder of Global Zero, a group opposed to nuclear weapons. It is tempting for the United States to exploit its superiority in cyberwarfare to hobble the nuclear forces of North Korea or other opponents. As a new form of missile defense, cyberwarfare seems to offer the possibility of preventing nuclear strikes without the firing of a single nuclear warhead. But as with many things involving nuclear weaponry, escalation of this strategy has a downside: United States forces are also vulnerable to such attacks.     Imagine the panic if we had suddenly learned during the Cold War that a bulwark of America's nuclear deterrence could not even get off the ground because of an exploitable deficiency in its control network.   We had such an Achilles' heel not so long ago. Minuteman missiles were vulnerable to a disabling cyberattack, and no one realized it for many years. If not for a curious and persistent President Barack Obama, it might never have been discovered and rectified.   In 2010, 50 nuclear-armed Minuteman missiles sitting in underground silos in Wyoming mysteriously disappeared from their launching crews' monitors for nearly an hour. The crews could not have fired the missiles on presidential orders or discerned whether an enemy was trying to launch them. Was this a technical malfunction or was it something sinister? Had a hacker discovered an electronic back door to cut the links? For all the crews knew, someone had put all 50 missiles into countdown to launch. The missiles were designed to fire instantly as soon as they received a short stream of computer code, and they are indifferent about the code's source.   It was a harrowing scene, and apprehension rippled all the way to the White House. Hackers were constantly bombarding our nuclear networks, and it was considered possible that they had breached the firewalls. The Air Force quickly determined that an improperly installed circuit card in an underground computer was responsible for the lockout, and the problem was fixed.   But President Obama was not satisfied and ordered investigators to continue to look for similar vulnerabilities. Sure enough, they turned up deficiencies, according to officials involved in the investigation.   One of these deficiencies involved the Minuteman silos, whose internet connections could have allowed hackers to cause the missiles' flight guidance systems to shut down, putting them out of commission and requiring days or weeks to repair.   These were not the first cases of cybervulnerability. In the mid-1990s, the Pentagon uncovered an astonishing firewall breach that could have allowed outside hackers to gain control over the key naval radio transmitter in Maine used to send launching orders to ballistic missile submarines patrolling the Atlantic. So alarming was this discovery, which I learned about from interviews with military officials, that the Navy radically redesigned procedures so that submarine crews would never accept a launching order that came out of the blue unless it could be verified through a second source.   Cyberwarfare raises a host of other fears. Could a foreign agent launch another country's missiles against a third country? We don't know. Could a launch be set off by false early warning data that had been corrupted by hackers? This is an especially grave concern because the president has only three to six minutes to decide how to respond to an apparent nuclear attack.   This is the stuff of nightmares, and there will always be some doubt about our vulnerability. We lack adequate control over the supply chain for nuclear components -- from design to manufacture to maintenance. We get much of our hardware and software off-the-shelf from commercial sources that could be infected by malware. We nevertheless routinely use them in critical networks. This loose security invites an attempt at an attack with catastrophic consequences. The risk would grow exponentially if an insider, wittingly or not, shares passwords, inserts infected thumb drives or otherwise facilitates illicit access to critical computers.   One stopgap remedy is to take United States and Russian strategic nuclear missiles off hair-trigger alert. Given the risks, it is dangerous to keep missiles in this physical state, and to maintain plans for launching them on early indications of an attack. Questions abound about the susceptibility to hacking of tens of thousands of miles of underground cabling and the backup radio antennas used for launching Minuteman missiles. They (and their Russian counterparts) should be taken off alert. Better yet, we should eliminate silo-based missiles and quick-launch procedures on all sides.   But this is just a start. We need to conduct a comprehensive examination of the threat and develop a remediation plan. We need to better understand the unintended consequences of cyberwarfare -- such as possibly weakening another nation's safeguards against unauthorized launching. We need to improve control over our nuclear supply chain. And it is time to reach an agreement with our rivals on the red lines. The reddest line should put nuclear networks off limits to cyberintrusion. Despite its allure, cyberwarfare risks causing nuclear pandemonium.

The Lauded Russian Hacker Whose Company Landed on the U.S. Blacklist,"MOSCOW -- The blacklist includes two people suspected of cybercrimes, and four others who are military intelligence officers. All are the kinds of figures one might expect to be on a list of people targeted by the Obama administration in retaliation for Russia's malfeasance, including efforts to influence the 2016 election. Then there is the one who calls herself ''mishacker,'' a globe-trotter with a rebellious online persona who is perhaps the most intriguing of the newly revealed Russian spies.     On what appears to be her personal website, called ''Hello, stranger,'' that person, Alisa Shevchenko, introduces herself and expounds on some of her digital accomplishments, including setting up a work space for hackers in Moscow.   ''My name is Alisa,'' the site reads. ''I am a human being. Part misfit, part mishacker. A businesswoman in the past as well as in a possible future. Currently I am mostly working on vulnerabilities and exploits, while striving to minimize entropy in the process.''   The White House identified the company Ms. Shevchenko founded, Zor Security, as a supplier to the Russian military's Main Intelligence Directorate, or G.R.U., the group said to be behind the hacking attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. The United States government said the company provided technical support to the G.R.U. for the attacks.   Ms. Shevchenko had been a minor celebrity in Moscow computer industry circles as a ''legal'' hacker. An article in the Russian edition of Forbes magazine in 2014 described the work of her business as discovering security flaws in the software of banks and other institutions.   And a year before the United States government applied sanctions against her company, the  Department of Homeland Security said she had helped prevent cybercrime under a program of information sharing between the public and private sector. Ms. Shevchenko was said to have assisted a French company, Schneider Electric, in identifying vulnerabilities in its software.   Ms. Shevchenko was recognized in a notice from the department's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, set up to coordinate between the government and industry to protect ''the nation's critical infrastructure.''   This nod from the American government illustrates Ms. Shevchenko's ambiguous role and, more broadly, the diversity of people believed to be working inside Russia's government hacking program. The inclusion of Ms. Shevchenko's company on the American sanctions list sheds light on the sprawling scope of the effort, which drew in students, civilians and possibly criminal hackers to bolster the military and intelligence agencies' cyberwar abilities.   Praised in the Russian news media as a young talent in 2005, when she was just 21, Ms. Shevchenko worked on cyberdefense projects but embraced the symbols and parlance of criminal hackers.   She has tattoos and often posts messages on Twitter under the handle ''badd1e.''   In a flurry of Twitter posts on Friday, Ms. Shevchenko mocked an American sanctioning agency, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, with a vulgarism, and said that she had already closed Zor Security.   A message sent to Ms. Shevchenko's Twitter account was not answered Friday.   ''How my little simple company (closed long ago at that) could possibly appear in the same list with the FSB and international terrorists,'' she wrote, using the initials of the Russian name of the Federal Security Service, the successor to the K.G.B.   The Forbes article identified Ms. Shevchenko as the winner of a hacking contest in 2014, in which she had found her way into industrial control software used for such things as running electrical power plants and grids.   ''I didn't expect such triviality,'' she was quoted as saying after winning the contest. She said she found ''around 10 vulnerabilities in just a few hours.''   On her website, Ms. Shevchenko posted a link to a blog entry on the award she won.   ''If exploited in real life, discovered vulnerabilities could cause harmful consequences, such as denial of service, functional failure of critical infrastructure management systems, which in its turn may disrupt normal life of an entire city,'' the blog post said of her hack.   Her Twitter feed cultivates the persona of a digital rebel.   In Moscow, her website said, Ms. Shevchenko founded a working space for hackers in the Chistye Prudy neighborhood of the capital, called Neuron Hackspace, also ostensibly for legitimate security purposes.   The more prominent of the two cybercriminal suspects designated in the sanctions announced by the Obama administration was Yevgeny M. Bogachev, who the Treasury Department said was a developer of malicious software. One product, called Zeus, was used to steal bank account information, while another, Cryptolocker, scrambled the system of victims until they paid a ransom, according to the Treasury Department. The sanction notice said Mr. Bogachev had stolen about $100 million from American companies and government agencies.   While the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Mr. Bogachev for criminal activities rather than political ones, at times in Russia's digital underworld, the distinction is one without a difference.   In the current wave of Russian politicized hacking, code from the Zeus malware showed up in phishing attacks, according to Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder and the chief technology officer of the American cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.   The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on Aleksei A. Belan, who is accused in the theft of email addresses and passwords from customers of three e-commerce companies.   ''The fact is, the Russian system of mathematical education is quite good,'' Anton M. Shingarev, a vice president at Kaspersky, a Russian antivirus company, said in an interview. ''And it produces a lot of computer programmers. And this is the reason why there are a lot of Russian hackers.''     "
Denmark Says 'Key Elements' of Russian Government Hacked Defense Ministry,"MOSCOW -- The Kremlin on Monday denied accusations that ''key elements'' of the Russian government had hacked into email accounts at Denmark's Defense Ministry over the last two years in a sustained cyberattack.  A new report by the Danish government's Center for Cybersecurity said that hackers had breached email accounts and servers at both the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry in 2015 and 2016. The hackers gained access to login information but did not obtain any classified information from the compromised Defense Ministry accounts, the report said.    Denmark faces a ''very high'' threat of cyberespionage against both the government and private companies, according to the report from the center, an arm of the Danish Defense Intelligence Service. It emphasized that the attacks were all connected and part of a constant threat.   Although the report, made public on Sunday, did not name Russia, Defense Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen blamed Moscow in his remarks to the Danish news media.   ''This is part of a continuing war from the Russian side in this field, where we are seeing a very aggressive Russia,'' Mr. Hjort Frederiksen told the Danish news agency Ritzau. ''The hacked emails don't contain military secrets, but it is of course serious.''   The attack was well organized, he was quoted as saying by the Berlingske daily newspaper. ''It's connected to the intelligence agencies or key elements of the Russian government, and it's an eternal struggle to keep them away,'' he said.   Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for the Kremlin, dismissed the accusations, as Russia does regularly with any hacking allegations.   ''Russia does not do hacking attacks,'' Mr. Peskov told reporters at his daily briefing. ''We would like to understand what he is talking about and what became the basis for these statements.''   The Danish report named the hacking agent as APT 28 and cited various other aliases, including Fancy Bear, Sofacy and Pawn Storm.   Investigators in the United States have identified Fancy Bear -- believed to be directed by the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence agency -- as responsible for hacking into the email system at the Democratic National Committee last year, an accusation the Kremlin denied.   The Danish report said that the attempt to hack the Foreign Ministry had failed, but that some email accounts at the Defense Ministry had been copied. Those workers could be subject to blackmail or recruitment, the report said.   Neither the report nor the defense minister provided details of who or what departments had been targeted.   Some policy analysts in Denmark dismissed the accusations as part of the lobbying over a new Defense Ministry budget, while other politicians and officials criticized the defense minister for suggesting that there would be no consequences for Russia.   Denmark has been the target of Russian ire before, in the tensions between Europe and the Kremlin that arose in 2014 over the Ukraine crisis. At that time, Russia threatened to aim nuclear missiles at Danish warships if the country joined NATO's missile defense system.     "
Macron Campaign Says It Was Hit by 'Massive' Hacking Attack,"PARIS -- On the eve of the most consequential French presidential election in decades, the staff of the centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron said late Friday that the campaign had been targeted by a ''massive and coordinated'' hacking operation, one with the potential to destabilize the nation's democracy before voters go to the polls on Sunday. The digital attack, which involved a dump of campaign documents including emails and accounting records, emerged hours before a legal prohibition on campaign communications went into effect. While the leak may be of little consequence, the timing makes it extremely difficult for Mr. Macron to mitigate any damaging fallout before the runoff election, in which he faces the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who has pledged to pull France out of the euro and hold a referendum to leave the European Union.    The hacking immediately evoked comparisons to last year's presidential election in the United States, during which American intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered an ''influence campaign'' to benefit the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump. Groups linked to Russia have been accused of trying to hack the Macron organization.    Groups linked to Russia, that are also believed to have been involved in the hacking related to the 2016 United States presidential campaign, have previously been accused of trying to breach the Macron organization. Security experts tracking the activity of suspected Russian hackers say they believe those same groups were involved in this latest attack.   In a statement, the Macron campaign said the hackers had mixed fake documents along with authentic ones, ''to sow doubt and misinformation.''   ''Intervening in the final hour of the official campaign, this operation is clearly a matter of democratic destabilization, as was seen in the United States during the last presidential campaign,'' the statement said.   Earlier on Friday, Ms. Le Pen's campaign staff said its website also had faced ''regular and targeted'' attacks during the campaign.   It also said that the French authorities had investigated the attacks and, this week, arrested a suspect who was ''close to extreme-left circles'' and who had admitted to being responsible for several attacks on Ms. Le Pen's campaign website. The arrest occurred on French soil, the statement said.   Unlike Mr. Macron, however, it did not appear that Ms. Le Pen's campaign documents had been compromised. The authorities did not immediately confirm the Le Pen camp's account.   The Macron campaign said the documents leaked Friday were stolen several weeks ago after the personal and professional emails of staff members at En Marche, his political movement, were hacked.   It was not the first reported hacking attempt of Mr. Macron's campaign. In April, a report by the cybersecurity firm Trend Micro said there was evidence that the campaign was targeted in March by what appeared to be the same Russian operatives who were responsible for hacks of Democratic campaign officials before last year's American presidential election. Mr. Macron's campaign said the attack was unsuccessful.   Trend Micro said the attack involved sending emails to campaign officials and others with links to fake websites designed to bait them into turning over passwords.   In the attack reported on Friday, Vitali Kremez, the director of research at Flashpoint, a business risk intelligence company in New York, said he suspected the involvement of a Russian-linked espionage operation known as APT28. ''The key goals and objectives of the campaign appear to be to undermine Macron's presidential candidacy and cast doubt on the democratic electoral process in general,'' he said.   ''If indeed driven by Moscow, this leak appears to be a significant escalation over the previous Russian operations aimed at the U.S. presidential election, expanding the approach and scope of effort from simple espionage efforts towards more direct attempts to sway the outcome,'' Mr. Kremez added.   Security researchers who have been tracking APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, say it has been moving aggressively against NATO members and a variety of Western targets using various hacking tools, including so-called spear-phishing attacks, but also through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in technologies that allow hackers to invade their targets undetected by security software.   The security researchers, who asked for anonymity to discuss an investigation, say they believe APT28 has previously passed stolen information taken from breached accounts to another Russian group. It is that second group of Russian cybercriminals that, in other instances, has published leaked information, security experts say, in large part to distance Russian intelligence operatives from the hacks and maintain a measure of plausible deniability.   There was no firm evidence that APT28 was involved in the theft of the Macron campaign documents.   Candidates and their staff are prohibited by French electoral rules from campaigning between midnight on Friday and when the last polls close at 8 p.m. Sunday -- meaning that they cannot give interviews to the news media, hold rallies, make speeches or issue statements.   The Macron campaign made its statement about the hacking at 11:56 p.m. -- four minutes before the legal prohibition on campaigning went into effect.   Numerama, a French online publication focusing on digital life, said that the hacked material appeared to have been disseminated through users of 4Chan, an online bulletin board. They shared nine gigabytes worth of documents and emails -- ''a jumble of what appears to be the contents of a hard drive and several emails of co-workers and En Marche political officials.''   ''It will take to time to sift through it all, but at first glance, they seem to be utterly mundane,'' Numerama said after analyzing the data. ''One finds memos, bills, loans for amounts that are hardly over-the-top, recommendations and other reservations, amidst, of course, exchanges that are strictly personal and private -- personal notes on the rain and sunshine, a confirmation email for the publishing of a book, reservation of a table for friends, etc.''   Some of the documents did not appear to have any link to Mr. Macron, Numerama reported.   The National Commission for Control of the Electoral Campaign, a regulatory body, said it was contacted by the Macron campaign on Friday night. The commission, which planned to meet on Saturday about the hacking, urged the news media to be cautious in its reporting.   ''It therefore asks the media, and in particular their websites, not to report on the content of these data, recalling that the dissemination of false information is liable to fall within the scope of the law -- in particular criminal law,'' the commission said.   The Macron campaign appealed to journalists to not do the hackers' bidding by widely publicizing the contents of the emails.   ''We call upon the news outlets that wish to report on this operation to shoulder their responsibilities, in all good conscience,'' the campaign said. ''Indeed, this is not a simple hacking operation but well and truly an attempt to destabilize the French presidential election. It is therefore important to consider the nature of the leaked documents, to be fully aware of the fact that a large part of them are purely and simply fake, and the appropriateness of giving an echo to this destabilization operation.''   Gérard Araud, the French ambassador to Washington, said of the attack, in a post on Twitter that was later deleted: ''It was to be expected. The last-ditch offensive benefiting a candidacy favored by a foreign government.''   One of Ms. Le Pen's top allies, Florian Philippot, the vice president of her party, the National Front, asked on Twitter: ''Will the #Macronleaks learn things that investigative journalism has deliberately killed,'' referring to his argument that the mainstream news media has been biased against Ms. Le Pen. ''Scary, this democratic shipwreck.''   Mr. Macron, 39, an independent centrist and a former economy minister who is making his first run for elected office, has been favored in the polls over Ms. Le Pen, 48, a lawyer and political heir to the National Front movement her father, now estranged, founded in 1972. The party has taken strong stands against immigration, globalization and the European Union.   The two candidates confronted each other Wednesday night in a vicious debate that more resembled an American-style shoutfest than the Descartian discourse that French voters are more accustomed to. Ms. Le Pen, who was relentless in her attacks, was widely judged the loser.   A post-debate poll, by the firm Ipsos -- which was very accurate in its projections before the first round of the elections on April 23 -- found Mr. Macron's lead over Ms. Le Pen had widened, 63 percent to 37 percent.   But Ms. Le Pen could benefit on Sunday if poor and disaffected suburban voters do not cast ballots or if on-the-fence voters who are unenthusiastic about their choices decide to abstain.     "
Macron Hacking Attack: What We Know and Don't Know,"The campaign of the French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron was hit on Friday by a large dump of leaked emails and other documents on a file-sharing website. Far-right groups in the United States were promoting the leaked information -- said to contain both real and fake documents -- to cast doubt on the election, pivotal for France and the European Union at large.     Mr. Macron has a roughly 20-point lead over his opponent, Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front, in the polls.   What We Know About the Breach   The data related to Mr. Macron's movement, En Marche!, that was leaked on the internet Friday night was dumped hours before a legal prohibition on campaign communications went into effect.   Links to nine gigabytes of zip and torrent files were published under the profile of someone called EMLEAKS on Pastebin, an anonymous publishing website. The archive was shared on the popular forum 4chan and promoted on Twitter by far-right activists, before WikiLeaks gave it extensive exposure online.   So far, the leak appears to mostly include documents that show the mundane inner workings of a presidential campaign, including professional and private emails, memos, contracts and accounting documents.   Mr. Macron's campaign said in a statement shortly before the blackout went into effect that the professional and personal email accounts of some of its staff members had been hacked ''some weeks ago.''   The campaign said that all of the stolen documents were ''legal'' and ''authentic'' but that fake ones had been added to ''sow doubt and disinformation.'' It denounced the breach as an attempt to destabilize democracy.   The National Commission for Control of the Electoral Campaign, a French regulatory body, warned on Saturday that publishing the documents might qualify as a crime. It called on the news media and French citizens to ''show a spirit of responsibility'' before the election.   En Marche! has been the target of hackers since last year. Last month, Trend Micro, a cybersecurity firm, said that a hacking group believed to be a Russian intelligence unit had attacked Mr. Macron's campaign, sending emails to campaign officials and others with links to fake websites designed to bait them into turning over passwords.   What We Don't Know About the Hack    What is genuine and what isn't. It will presumably take experts weeks to sift through and assess all the leaked documents.    Whether different individuals or groups were behind the thefts and the leaks, who they are and what their motives were.   Experts suspect a Russian-linked espionage operation known as A.P.T. 28, or Fancy Bear, may be involved, although there is no firm evidence that the operation was behind the thefts. European and American analysts have determined that the group was responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee last year.    Whether the leaks, emerging less than 48 hours before the French go to the polls, will affect the election's outcome. Because of a blackout legally imposed on TV and radio, news of the leaks is not likely to reach as large an audience as it would usually have.     "
"With Cars Becoming More Like Computers, The Threats Multiply","Any part of a car that talks to the outside world is a potential opportunity for hackers. That includes the car's entertainment and navigation systems, preloaded music and mapping apps, tire-pressure sensors, even older entry points like a CD drive. It also includes technologies that are still in the works, like computer vision systems and technology that will allow vehicles to communicate with one another.    It will be five to 10 years -- or even more -- before a truly driverless car, without a steering wheel, hits the market. In the meantime, digital automobile security experts will have to solve problems that the cybersecurity industry still has not quite figured out.    ''There's still time for manufacturers to start paying attention, but we need the conversation around security to happen now,'' said Marc Rogers, the principal security researcher at the cybersecurity firm CloudFlare.   Their primary challenge will be preventing hackers from getting into the heart of the car's crucial computing system, called a CAN (or computer area network).   While most automakers now install gateways between a driver's systems and the car's CAN network, repeated hacks of Jeeps and Teslas have shown that with enough skill and patience, hackers can bypass those gateways.   And the challenge of securing driverless cars only gets messier as automakers figure out how to design an autonomous car that can safely communicate with other vehicles through so-called V2V, or vehicle-to-vehicle, communication.   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed that V2V equipment be installed in all cars in the future. But that channel, and all the equipment involved, open millions more access points for would-be attackers.   It's not just V2V communications that security experts are concerned about. Some engineers have imagined a future of vehicle-to-infrastructure communications that would allow police officers to automatically enforce safe driving speeds in construction zones, near schools or around accidents.   Given the yearslong lag time from car design to production, security researchers are also concerned about the shelf life of software deeply embedded in a car, which may no longer be supported, or patched, by the time the car makes it out of the lot.   In 2014, for example, some curious Tesla Model S owners did some tinkering and claimed to have discovered a customized version of a type of Linux software called Ubuntu. Ubuntu was first released in October 2010 and has not been supported since December 2014. ''In effect, that means the operating system in your car was depreciated before you bought it,'' Mr. Rogers said.   And automakers stitch together software from dozens of different suppliers, all of them with different shelf lives and patch cycles. If automakers have any chance of keeping cars secure, figuring out a secure way to roll out patches to every car remotely, for different software components, will be a problem that even the software industry itself has not totally figured out.   ''The problem is when people buy a car, they think 'Oh, I'm buying a Toyota,' but what they're really buying is parts from 100 different suppliers all cobbled together,'' said Nidhi Kalra, a senior information scientist at the RAND Corporation. ''Cybersecurity cannot be applied on top of everything else. It needs to be based in the design of the vehicle and embedded throughout the entire supply chain.''   Last year, the Department of Transportation announced a 15-point safety standard for the design and development of driverless cars, which included mention of digital security. But the guidelines were intentionally vague and only required that ''The vehicles should be engineered with safeguards to prevent online attacks.''   Discussions are ongoing about which government body -- the Federal Trade Commission, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or another body -- will ultimately govern the cybersecurity of connected and autonomous cars.   For now, a number of private organizations are hosting discussions among automakers, identifying and cataloging common security threats.   But, as with any technology, Mr. Rogers said, ''We won't be able to shut people out forever.''     "
"Hackers Are Targeting Nuclear Plants, U.S. Says","Since May, hackers have been penetrating the computer networks of companies that operate nuclear power stations and other energy facilities, as well as manufacturing plants in the United States and other countries. Among the companies targeted was the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear power plant near Burlington, Kan., according to security consultants and an urgent joint report issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week.    The joint report was obtained by The New York Times and confirmed by security specialists who have been responding to the attacks. It carried an urgent amber warning, the second-highest rating for the sensitivity of the threat.    The report did not indicate whether the cyberattacks were an attempt at espionage -- such as stealing industrial secrets -- or part of a plan to cause destruction. There is no indication that hackers were able to jump from their victims' computers into the control systems of the facilities, nor is it clear how many facilities were breached.   Wolf Creek officials said that while they could not comment on cyberattacks or security issues, no ''operations systems'' had been affected and that their corporate network and the internet were separate from the network that runs the plant.   In a joint statement with the F.B.I., a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said, ''There is no indication of a threat to public safety, as any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks.''   The hackers appeared determined to map out computer networks for future attacks, the report concluded. But investigators have not been able to analyze the malicious ''payload'' of the hackers' code, which would offer more detail into what they were after.   John Keeley, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, which works with all 99 electric utilities that operate nuclear plants in the United States, said nuclear facilities are required to report cyberattacks that relate to their ''safety, security and operations.'' None have reported that the security of their operations was affected by the latest attacks, Mr. Keeley said.   In most cases, the attacks targeted people -- industrial control engineers who have direct access to systems that, if damaged, could lead to an explosion, fire or a spill of dangerous material, according to two people familiar with the attacks who could not be named because of confidentiality agreements.   The origins of the hackers are not known. But the report indicated that an ''advanced persistent threat'' actor was responsible, which is the language security specialists often use to describe hackers backed by governments.   The two people familiar with the investigation say that, while it is still in its early stages, the hackers' techniques mimicked those of the organization known to cybersecurity specialists as ''Energetic Bear,'' the Russian hacking group that researchers have tied to attacks on the energy sector since at least 2012.   Hackers wrote highly targeted email messages containing fake résumés for control engineering jobs and sent them to the senior industrial control engineers who maintain broad access to critical industrial control systems, the government report said.   The fake résumés were Microsoft Word documents that were laced with malicious code. Once the recipients clicked on those documents, attackers could steal their credentials and proceed to other machines on a network.   In some cases, the hackers also compromised legitimate websites that they knew their victims frequented -- something security specialists call a watering hole attack. And in others, they deployed what are known as man-in-the-middle attacks in which they redirected their victims' internet traffic through their own machines.   Energy, nuclear and critical manufacturing organizations have frequently been targets for sophisticated cyberattacks. The Department of Homeland Security has called cyberattacks on critical infrastructure ''one of the most serious national security challenges we must confront.''   On May 11, during the attacks, President Trump signed an executive order to strengthen the cybersecurity defenses of federal networks and critical infrastructure. The order required government agencies to work with public companies to mitigate risks and help defend critical infrastructure organizations ''at greatest risk of attacks that could reasonably result in catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety, economic security, or national security.''   The order specifically addressed the threats from ''electricity disruptions and prolonged power outages resulting from cybersecurity incidents.''   Jon Wellinghoff, the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in an interview last week that while the security of United States' critical infrastructure systems had improved in recent years, they were still vulnerable to advanced hacking attacks, particularly those that use tools stolen from the National Security Agency.   ''We never anticipated that our critical infrastructure control systems would be facing advanced levels of malware,'' Mr. Wellinghoff said.   In 2008, an attack called Stuxnet that was designed by the United States and Israel to hit Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility, demonstrated how computer attacks could disrupt and destroy physical infrastructure.   The government hackers infiltrated the systems that controlled Iran's nuclear centrifuges and spun them wildly out of control, or stopped them from spinning entirely, destroying a fifth of Iran's centrifuges.   In retrospect, Mr. Wellinghoff said that attack should have foreshadowed the threats the United States would face on its own infrastructure.   Critical infrastructure is increasingly controlled by Scada, or supervisory control and data acquisition systems. They are used by manufacturers, nuclear plant operators and pipeline operators to monitor variables like pressure and flow rates through pipelines. The software also allows operators to monitor and diagnose unexpected problems.   But like any software, Scada systems are susceptible to hacking and computer viruses. And for years, security specialists have warned that hackers could use remote access to these systems to cause physical destruction.     "
HBO Assesses Cyberattack Damage,"HBO continued to assess the extent of a cyberattack on its systems on Wednesday, working with law enforcement agencies and seeking to provide assurance to its employees. In a memo to staff, Richard Plepler, the premium cable network's chief executive, said that the company did not believe its ''email system as a whole has been compromised'' but that a forensic review was being conducted.    Mr. Plepler wrote in the memo that the network was trying to hire an outside firm ''to work with our employees to provide credit monitoring.''    HBO acknowledged on Monday that it had been victimized by a cyberattack, after an anonymous hacker boasted about leaking full episodes of upcoming shows like ''Ballers'' along with written material from next week's episode of ''Game of Thrones.''   The hacker or hackers claimed to have stolen an estimated 1.5 terabytes of data, according to Entertainment Weekly, which first reported the breach on Monday. The hacker said more material would be ''coming soon.''   The attack is not expected to have any impact on Time Warner's deal with AT&T, according to two people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to discuss private company matters. Only a large material change in Time Warner's business would prevent the deal from going through, one of the people said.   Unlike Yahoo, which disclosed last year that hackers had stolen the credentials of hundreds of millions of users in two breaches that went undetected for years, HBO does not appear to have sensitive personal information on a similar scale. Because the network typically sells its service through cable or satellite operators, it has not traditionally collected credit card information and other details about its customers. That has changed recently, however, as HBO introduced a stand-alone streaming service in 2015.   Much remains unclear about how much information was obtained in the cyberattack, which can be difficult to determine, said one of the people familiar with the breach. The person said the stolen content included a few show episodes, scripts and internal documents, like human resources records.   There is no evidence yet that any episodes of ''Game of Thrones'' have been stolen, which would be a significant blow to the network. ''Game of Thrones,'' currently in its penultimate season, is the most popular show in HBO's history and has long been a target of digital piracy. There are four highly anticipated episodes left in the season.   The network said in a statement on Monday that it was investigating the incident and was ''working with law enforcement and outside cybersecurity firms.''   In an email to employees this week, Mr. Plepler wrote, ''Any intrusion of this nature is obviously disruptive, unsettling and disturbing for all of us.''   He added: ''The problem before us is unfortunately all too familiar in the world we now find ourselves a part of.''   The breach of HBO, a major entertainment company, evokes the 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures. Hackers released tens of thousands of emails, some of them embarrassing, as well as scripts and financial data. United States officials placed responsibility for the attack on North Korea, and the Obama administration imposed sanctions on some North Korean officials. In the aftermath of the attack, the Sony Pictures chief, Amy Pascal, was ousted.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
"Yahoo Breach in 2013 Affected All 3 Billion Accounts, Not Just One-Third","Follow Nicole Perlroth on Twitter @nicoleperlroth It was the biggest known breach of a company's computer network. And now, it is even bigger. Verizon Communications, which acquired Yahoo this year, said on Tuesday that a previously disclosed attack that had occurred in 2013 affected all three billion of Yahoo's user accounts.    Last year, Yahoo said the 2013 attack on its network had affected one billion accounts. Three months before that, the company also disclosed a separate attack, which had occurred in 2014, that had affected 500 million accounts.    Digital thieves made off with names, birth dates, phone numbers and passwords of users that were encrypted with security that was easy to crack.   The intruders also obtained the security questions and backup email addresses used to reset lost passwords -- valuable information for someone trying to break into other accounts owned by the same user, and particularly useful to a hacker seeking to break into government computers around the world.   Yahoo sold itself to Verizon for $4.48 billion in June. But the deal was nearly derailed by the disclosure of the breaches and $350 million was cut from Verizon's original offer. Yahoo was combined with AOL, another faded web pioneer that Verizon bought in 2015, into a new division of the telecommunications company called Oath.   That investigators did not discover the full extent of the 2013 incident before Verizon closed the deal to acquire Yahoo in June was surprising to outside cybersecurity analysts.   ''Frankly, I don't know how Yahoo got away with this,'' said Jay Kaplan, a former Defense Department cybersecurity expert and senior analyst at the National Security Agency who is now the chief executive of the cybersecurity company Synack.   After Yahoo discovered that one billion accounts were affected, it should not have been a stretch to consider that all of the company's user accounts had been compromised, he said. ''My guess is that Yahoo was completely 'owned' across the board,'' Mr. Kaplan said.   Verizon said in a statement Tuesday that, with the assistance of outside forensic experts, it had determined that all Yahoo's user accounts were affected. The company said it would continue to work closely with law enforcement.   ''Our investment in Yahoo is allowing that team to continue to take significant steps to enhance their security, as well as benefit from Verizon's experience and resources,'' Chandra B. McMahon, Verizon's chief information security officer, said in the statement. The company said it did not have more to add beyond an additional fact sheet for users.   Yahoo was hit with several shareholder lawsuits after the breaches became public, and the disclosure that data on all of its accounts was compromised could increase financial liabilities for Verizon.   No one knows exactly what happened to the data after it was stolen in 2013. But last August, a hacking collective based in Eastern Europe quietly began offering Yahoo's information for sale, according to intelligence gathered by InfoArmor, an Arizona cybersecurity company that monitors the darker corners of the web.   Since then, at least three buyers -- two known ''spammers'' and an entity that appeared more interested in using the stolen Yahoo data for espionage -- paid about $300,000 each for a complete copy of Yahoo's stolen database, InfoArmor said after Yahoo first disclosed the breach.   Cybersecurity professionals warned that because many of the three billion Yahoo accounts belong to people who use the same passwords for different sites and services, there is likely to be an escalation of email fraud and account takeovers. They added that anyone who had used Yahoo should be diligent about monitoring their personal accounts.   With the stolen data, fraudsters have a higher chance of gaining access to the victims' bank accounts, said Frances Zelazny, the vice president of marketing at BioCatch, a security start-up. ''Most people reuse passwords or make multiple versions of the same passwords that are easy to hack,'' she said.   Yahoo maintains that the breaches in 2014 and 2013 are not related. But investigators believe the attackers behind the 2013 breach were Russian and possibly linked to the Russian government.   In March, the Department of Justice charged four men, including two Russian intelligence officers, with the 2014 breach. Investigators said the Russian government used stolen Yahoo data to spy on a range of targets in the United States, including White House and military officials, bank executives and even a gambling regulator in Nevada, according to an indictment.   The stolen data was also used to spy on Russian government officials and business executives, federal prosecutors said.   What made that theft particularly egregious, Justice Department officials said, was that the two intelligence officers who were indicted had worked for an arm of Russia's Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., that is charged with helping foreign intelligence agencies track cybercriminals.     "
Security Agency Breach Is Linked to Popular Russian Antivirus Software,"WASHINGTON -- In the latest case of an insider removing sensitive data from the nation's largest intelligence agency, Russian hackers obtained classified documents that a National Security Agency employee had taken and stored on his home computer. Investigators believe the hackers may have penetrated the computer by exploiting Kaspersky Lab antivirus software, a Russian brand widely used around the world, that the employee was using, according to officials briefed on the matter. The highly classified material involved the agency's techniques for breaking into foreign computer networks to collect intelligence, the officials said. The case appears to be separate from a larger breach of  security, by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which has been publicly posting samples of the agency's hacking tools periodically for more than a year. The case was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday.     Investigators say the employee does not appear to have intended to let the sensitive cybertools escape to the outside world. Officials believe he took the material home -- an egregious violation of agency rules and the law -- because he wanted to refer to it as he worked on his résumé. The maker of the antivirus software installed on his home computer, Kaspersky Lab, is a Russian company that American security officials have long feared may cooperate with, or be infiltrated by, the Russian government.   The officials did not make their concerns public, and the antivirus software remains popular. But last month the federal government ordered the Kaspersky software removed from all government computers. The F.B.I. has been investigating whether Kaspersky products, especially the well-reviewed antivirus programs, contain ''back doors'' that could allow Russian intelligence agencies into any computers or networks on which they are running. The company has always denied that it has any links to Russian intelligence.   It is unclear whether the National Security Agency breach played a major role in the government's decision to ban Kaspersky products. While the Russian theft was first discovered two years ago, the Kaspersky link was understood only more recently.   The concerns about Kaspersky Lab date back many years, in part because its founder, Eugene Kaspersky, attended a K.G.B. technical college and served in military intelligence. Tim Evans, a former National Security Agency lawyer, said that in 2008 he was dispatched by the agency to the United States Patent Office to retrieve every patent application filed by Kaspersky so that the agency could study the names of its employees for known officers of the F.S.B., the K.G.B.'s successor.   ''This is an old question for N.S.A.,'' said Mr. Evans, now with Adlumin, a cybersecurity contractor.   While federal prosecutors in Maryland are handling the case, the agency employee who took the documents home does not appear to have been charged. In the past, taking classified information from agency premises and storing it on an insecure computer has been considered a prosecutable offense. John M. Deutch, who served as director of the C.I.A. in 1995 and 1996, was investigated after classified information was found on his unclassified laptops. He agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor but was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.   The breach is only the latest blow to the National Security Agency, which for decades has broken foreign codes and eavesdropped on telephone and other communications. Today it devotes a huge effort as well to penetrating computer networks overseas to gather information.   In 2013, Edward J. Snowden, an agency contractor in Hawaii, took hundreds of thousands of classified documents, flew to Hong Kong and turned the material over to journalists. Last year, another contractor, Harold T. Martin III, was discovered to have taken an even larger quantity of agency data to his Maryland home, where he stored it in his car and in a shed in his yard. About the same time Mr. Martin was arrested, the unidentified Shadow Brokers began to post some of the agency's most guarded software tools on the web.   ''They just keep getting hammered,'' said Robert S. Johnston, the president of Adlumin and another former agency officer. ''N.S.A. used to say they'd never had a spy. That's totally changed since 2013.''   Several former agency officers said the breach might not necessarily require complicity on the part of Kaspersky Lab. Antivirus software routinely scans files to hunt for malware and even uploads files to the cloud for particular study. By redirecting data between the employee's computer and Kaspersky back to their own servers, via a ''man in the middle attack,'' or hacking Kaspersky's software and adding a back door, Russian operators could have potentially downloaded the employee's files without Kaspersky's knowledge.   ''Antivirus software could totally be used for espionage,'' said Jake Williams, a former officer at the agency and the founder of Rendition Infosec, a cybersecurity contractor. ''It looks damning for Kaspersky, but we don't yet know the whole story.''     "
Toys That Make The Wrong Kind Of Connection,"SAN FRANCISCO -- My Friend Cayla, a doll with nearly waist-length golden hair that talks and responds to children's questions, was designed to bring delight to households. But there's something else that Cayla might bring into homes as well: hackers and identity thieves. Earlier this year, Germany's Federal Network Agency, the country's regulatory office, labeled Cayla ''an illegal espionage apparatus'' and recommended that parents destroy it. Retailers there were told they could sell the doll only if they disconnected its ability to connect to the internet, the feature that also allows in hackers. And the Norwegian Consumer Council called Cayla a ''failed toy.''     The doll is not alone. As the holiday shopping season enters its frantic last days, many manufacturers are promoting ''connected'' toys to keep children engaged. There's also a smart watch for kids, a droid from the recent ''Star Wars'' movies and a furry little Furby. These gadgets can all connect with the internet to interact -- a Cayla doll can whisper to children in several languages that she's great at keeping secrets, while a plush Furby Connect doll can smile back and laugh when tickled.   But once anything is online, it is potentially exposed to hackers, who look for weaknesses to gain access to digitally connected devices. Then once hackers are in, they can use the toys' cameras and microphones to potentially see and hear whatever the toy sees and hears. As a result, according to cybersecurity experts, the toys can be turned to spy on little ones or to track their location.   ''Parents need to be aware of what they are buying and bringing home to their children,'' said Javvad Malik, a researcher with cybersecurity company AlienVault. ''Many of these internet-connected devices have trivial ways to bypass security, so people have to be aware of what they're buying and how secure it is.''   The problem isn't new, but it's growing as manufacturers introduce a wider range of toys that can connect online, part of an overall trend of ''smart'' electronics. About 8.4 billion ''connected things'' will be in use worldwide this year, according to estimates from research firm Gartner, up 31 percent from 2016, with the number projected to rise to 20.4 billion by 2020.   Sarah Jamie Lewis, an independent cybersecurity researcher who tested toys ahead of the holiday season, said many of the products did not take basic steps to ensure their communications were secure and that a child's information would be protected. She said the toys acted as ''uncontrolled spy devices'' because manufacturers failed to include a process that would allow the gadget to connect to the internet only through certain trusted devices.   Consider the Furby Connect doll made by Hasbro, a furry egg-shaped gadget that comes in teal, pink and purple. Researchers from Which?, a British charity, and the German consumer group Stiftung Warentest recently found that the Bluetooth feature of the Furby Connect could enable anyone within 100 feet of the doll to hijack the connection and use it to turn on the microphone and speak to children.   Then there's the Q50, a smart watch for children. Marketed as a way to help parents easily communicate with and keep track of their kids, bugs in the watch would allow hackers to ''intercept all communications, remotely listen to the child's surroundings and spoof the child's location,'' according to  a report by Top10VPN, a consumer research company this month.   And the BB-8 droid, which was released with ''The Last Jedi'' this month, also had an insecure Bluetooth connection, according to Ms. Lewis's tests.   SinoPro, the Chinese manufacturer of the Q50 watch, and Genesis, the maker of the Cayla doll, did not respond to requests for comment. Sphero, the maker of the BB-8 connected droid, said the toy is ''adequately secure.'' Hasbro said the Furby Connect complies with the United States Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and that it hired third-party testers to perform security testing on the toy and app.   Toy manufacturers have long searched for ways to bring toys alive for children. While microphones and cameras introduced some level of responsiveness, those interactions were generally limited to a canned response preset by a manufacturer. Internet connections opened up a new wealth of possibilities; now the toys can be paired with a computer or cellphone to allow children to constantly update their toys with new features.   The My Friend Cayla doll, for example, uses speech recognition software coupled with Google Translate. The doll's microphone records speech and then transmits it over the internet, a function that leaves it open to hackers, according to cybersecurity researchers. If the doll's owner does not designate a specific cellphone or tablet with which the doll should have an internet connection, anyone within 50 feet of the toy can use the Bluetooth connection to gain access to it. Security researchers have also raised concerns over what type of data the doll collects, and how the data is used.   [Video: #toyfail - English Watch on YouTube.]   In 2015, a cyberattack on VTech Holdings, a digital toymaker, exposed the data of over 6.4 million people, including names, date of birth and gender, in what experts said was the largest known breach to date that targeted children.   For parents looking to fulfill their holiday wish-lists, the first step is knowing about the risks involved with internet-connected toys. Earlier this year, the F.B.I. issued a broad warning about such toys, advising parents to pay particular attention to how a toy connected to the internet. If a toy connects wirelessly through Bluetooth, it should require some type of unique pin or password, to make sure that connection is secure.   The F.B.I. also recommended that connected toys be able to receive updates from the manufacturers so they are kept up-to-date. And if the toy stores data, parents should investigate where that data is stored and how securely the company guards the data of its customers.   At a Target store this month in Emeryville, Calif., Sarah Lee, a 37-year-old mother of three, said she was rethinking her choices of presents for her children after hearing about the risks of connected toys.   ''That's so scary, I had no idea that was possible,'' she said. ''What's the worst hackers can do? Wait, no, don't tell me. I'd just rather get my kids an old-fashioned doll.''

Yahoo Chief and Lawyer Penalized Over Breach,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Yahoo's top lawyer, Ronald S. Bell, resigned Wednesday, and its chief executive, Marissa Mayer, lost her 2016 bonus after a board investigation of the 2014 theft of information on more than 500 million user accounts. Senior executives, company lawyers and information security staff were aware of the hack in 2014 and also knew about subsequent attempts to break into the affected accounts in 2015 and 2016, but failed to ''properly comprehend or investigate'' the situation, the company's board of directors said in a securities filing on Wednesday.     The board ''did not conclude that there was an intentional suppression of relevant information.''   Those hackers, which Yahoo believes were connected to a foreign government, used the stolen information to forge a type of software called a cookie that could be used to access 32 million Yahoo accounts, the company said.   Ms. Mayer, who will also give up her 2017 equity compensation in connection with the incident, said in a statement that she did not learn of the breach until September 2016, when Yahoo first disclosed the hack to the public. ''However, I am the C.E.O. of the company and since this incident happened during my tenure, I have agreed to forgo my annual bonus and my annual equity grant this year,'' she wrote.   Under Ms. Mayer's employment agreement, her annual target bonus is $2 million a year and her annual stock award is supposed to be no less than $12 million a year. Her base salary is $1 million a year.   The company's filing, which it said concluded its investigation, avoided naming any individuals responsible for Yahoo's security woes, and it left many important questions unanswered.   The board offered no new information about the company's apparent failure to notice a separate theft in 2013 of the account information of one billion users.   That theft -- which was discovered last year by an outside security expert who noticed the information for sale on the black market -- was so serious that Yahoo forced all affected users to reset their passwords. ''We have not been able to identify the intrusion associated with this theft,'' the board said.   Yahoo is eager to put the incidents behind it and move forward with the sale of its internet operations to Verizon Communications. Last week, the companies announced that they had renegotiated the deal because of the breaches, shaving $350 million from the price, and they hope to close the transaction by the end of June.   Mr. Bell, a longtime lawyer at Yahoo, appears to be taking the blame for the company's security failures. Yahoo said he resigned on Wednesday and would receive no payments in connection with his departure. The company's chief information security officer at the time of the 2014 breach, Alex Stamos, left for Facebook in 2015 after repeated battles with Ms. Mayer over security priorities.   Yahoo said that 43 consumer class-action lawsuits related to the breaches have been filed against the company in federal, state and foreign courts. It also faces a stockholder class-action suit.   The company said that it is also cooperating with federal, state and foreign government officials and agencies seeking information about the incidents, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York and two state attorneys general.   Yahoo said it had revised its procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents, including the reporting of such incidents to senior executives and the board.   The company has incurred $16 million in direct costs so far related to the breaches.     "
Charges Don't End Sale of Yahoo Data,"SAN FRANCISCO -- For sale: one billion Yahoo accounts, $200,000 or best offer. The passwords don't work, but the dates of birth, telephone numbers and security questions could still be useful to an adept cyberthief. After federal prosecutors unsealed indictments this week against four men they say were responsible for a 2014 intrusion into Yahoo's systems that affected 500 million user accounts, data on one billion accounts -- stolen in another attack on the company a year earlier -- appeared to remain available on underground hacker forums on Friday.     The authorities were tight-lipped about their investigation of the 2013 attack, which is the largest known breach of a private company's computer systems. The 2014 hacking of Yahoo's servers is the second largest.   ''We're not willing to comment right now if there is a connection between the two investigations,'' Malcolm Palmore, who oversees the Federal Bureau of Investigation's cybersecurity division in San Francisco, said on Wednesday in a brief interview after the government unveiled the indictments.   But the two attacks share some common characteristics and may be linked in some fashion.   Both of them involved highly skilled Russian hackers, according to cybersecurity experts who have studied the attacks. In both cases, the hackers had links to the Russian government. And in both cases, at least some of the data was used to send spam to Yahoo users.   Alexsey Belan, the technical expert who was charged with breaking into Yahoo's systems in 2014 at the behest of two Russian intelligence officers, has a long record of cybercrime.   In 2012, he was indicted on three felony charges for hacking the computer systems of Zappos, the online shoe retailer owned by Amazon, and stealing information on as many as 24 million customers.   In 2013, Mr. Belan struck again, hacking into Evernote and Scribd, two digital document storage services, according to a federal indictment filed against him that June. Law enforcement authorities arrested him in Greece later that year, but he posted bail and fled to Russia.   Cybersecurity experts who have studied the incidents say the 2013 attack on Yahoo was most likely carried out by a different person. InfoArmor, an Arizona cybersecurity firm, has attributed it to a group of cyberthieves it calls Group E. That group sold the entire database at least three times, including once to an entity that InfoArmor believes was connected to the Russian government.   The indictment against Mr. Belan filed this week is vague about how he and his three co-conspirators gained access to Yahoo's systems.   Alex Holden, founder of Hold Security, a cybersecurity firm, said one prevailing theory in the industry was that Mr. Belan capitalized on the earlier breach. He said the person or people behind the 2013 intrusion probably sold, traded or were forced to share their access to Yahoo's systems with Russian intelligence services. The two Russian intelligence agents indicted in the 2014 breach are accused of using that access to conduct their own spying operation with the assistance of Mr. Belan and another conspirator in Canada.   The Russian government has strenuously denied any involvement in any hacking of Yahoo's systems.   Yahoo declined to comment on Friday, but pointed a reporter to a December statement about the 2013 attack. In that statement, the company said it had not been able to find the intrusion but that it was ''likely distinct'' from the 2014 one.   A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. declined to comment on Friday.   But during a briefing with reporters in San Francisco on Wednesday, F.B.I. officials said the intrusion into Yahoo's systems appeared to have begun with a spear-phishing attack, in which a Yahoo employee was tricked into disclosing information that allowed the attackers in.   Although Yahoo security officials noticed a breach in 2014, they initially believed it was limited in scope, according to securities filings made by the company. Senior executives were aware of the attack in 2014 but failed to recognize its significance, the company said.   Yahoo publicly disclosed the 2014 breach in September. It disclosed the larger, 2013 attack in December and forced all affected users who had not already done so to change their passwords.   The database of one billion accounts was on offer for $200,000, which Mr. Holden, the Hold Security founder, called ''an exorbitant amount of money.'' The asking price for a single address is $10,000.   The sellers claimed to have continued access to Yahoo's systems. But when Mr. Holden, posing as a buyer's representative, asked them to prove their access by giving him data about two new accounts, they could not do so.   Yahoo, for its part, has said that the security holes exploited by the hackers have been patched up.   The two attacks had threatened a $4.8 billion deal that Yahoo struck last summer to sell its internet businesses to Verizon Communications. Verizon sought to cut $925 million from the original selling price, but the two companies agreed last month to a $350 million reduction.   Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.     "
Equifax's Maddening Response,"Zeynep Tufekci (@zeynep), an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, is the author of ''Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest'' and a contributing opinion writer. Last week, Americans woke up to news of yet another mass breach of their personal data. The consumer credit reporting agency Equifax revealed that as many as 143 million Americans' Social Security numbers, dates of birth, names and addresses may have been stolen from its files -- just the kind of information that allows for identity theft and other cybercrimes. I don't know about you, but I've lost count of the number of times in recent years that I've been informed by a corporation of such a breach. ''We regret to inform you ....'' I don't doubt that companies regret these things, but I don't think they care that much either. To them it means just a few days of bad press and at most a fine that amounts to a minuscule portion of their profits. With penalties like that, why would companies bother to make things better?     There are technical factors that explain why cybersecurity is so weak, but the underlying reason is political, and it's pretty simple: Big corporations have poured large amounts of money into our political system, helping to create a regulatory environment in which consumers shoulder more and more of the risk, and companies less and less.   This is a general feature of our lopsided world, but software businesses (and the technology sides of other companies) have acquired perhaps the greatest degree of impunity. Information technology arrived on the scene only recently, so it has faced fewer of the kinds of regulations that consumers and citizens, in more progressive eras, managed to impose on other industries.   Today, almost every piece of software comes with a disclaimer on its user license that basically says that the product may not work as intended and that its maker may stop supporting it at any time, and that's the user's problem. It's a wonder companies don't insert ''nyah nyah nyah nyah'' into the tiny-print legalese.   Don't get me wrong: I'm a former programmer; I'm not unsympathetic to the needs of software developers. Some number of unexpected errors -- bugs -- are unavoidable in computer programs. It would be unreasonable to allow a consumer to sue a software company every time a program suffered a glitch.   But the situation was different when the industry was younger and wasn't rolling in billions of dollars, as it is now. Most software failures and data breaches aren't inevitable; they are a result of neglect and underinvestment in product reliability and security.   No software system can be free from bugs (or intruders), and users must be mindful of the risks. But the inherent lack of perfect automotive safety doesn't mean we don't try to make cars safer. Obviously, people should drive more carefully, but seatbelts, airbags and better car design reduce injury enormously, and that has been great for the industry as well as consumers. The software industry should be no different.   Perhaps the most maddening part of the Equifax breach is that the credit-rating industry is itself unforgiving in its approach to even the smallest error. I'm still dealing with the damage to my credit rating that resulted when I forgot to return a library book and a collection agency was called in (for a paltry sum). The Equifax executives who let my data be stolen will probably suffer fewer consequences than I will for an overdue library book. Even if they do get fired, it is likely that they will be sent off with millions of dollars in severance, which is common practice for executives. (I would like to note that I am available for such punishment any time.)   I've taught at a wide range of universities. I've found that institutions serving less-advantaged students tend to have less-forgiving policies for late papers, missed exams, casual drug use and so forth, whereas more elite institutions tend to be more forgiving. All young people deserve compassion, second chances and flexibility -- but the poorer ones even more so, since they have fewer resources with which to combat adversity when it strikes. Yet the reality is the opposite.   Along with news of the breach came reports that three Equifax executives sold $2 million worth of stock shortly after the breach was discovered in July. In their defense, Equifax said that the executives were not aware of the breach -- and that the amount was only ''a small percentage of their Equifax shares.'' It's almost as if the company is saying: Come on, would we engage in insider trading for a mere $2 million?   As long as impunity for corporations and their executives is the norm, data breaches will continue to happen. What should you do? It's easy: Just make sure to change your name, Social Security number and home address regularly -- and don't go crying if you neglect to do that and suffer the consequences of your actions. It's not as if you're are a rich executive.   Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.      "
"Replacing Its C.E.O., Equifax Tries To Turn Page","When the board of Equifax convened last week to discuss the company's response to an enormous data breach, the 10 outside directors concluded that it was time for their hard-driving chief executive to step down. There was a problem, though. The roster of possible replacements had been depleted by the fallout from the cyberattack, which had compromised the personal information of much of the adult population of the United States.    Some top contenders were considered tainted, according to two people briefed on the board's deliberations. Three of the company's senior executives, including the head of its largest division and the chief financial officer, are under scrutiny for selling stock after the breach was discovered but before it had been disclosed to the public.    Equifax spent five more days limping through the crisis before announcing on Tuesday that the chief executive, Richard F. Smith, would retire.   The shake-up is the culmination of weeks of mounting public and legal pressure on the Atlanta-based data clearinghouse from citizens, politicians and investors. The company's lackluster response to the breach has prompted consumer outrage, while lawmakers have begun pushing for tougher oversight of the industry.   Although Mr. Smith retired, the board took an unusual step that reflected the damage from the breach. The board said it could retroactively classify Mr. Smith as having been fired for cause. If that were to happen, Mr. Smith would probably be required to forgo or repay certain compensation.   Mr. Smith will be replaced on an interim basis by the company's head of its Asia-Pacific region, Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. One of Equifax's outside board members, Mark Feidler, will succeed Mr. Smith as nonexecutive chairman. The company is now conducting a search for a permanent chief executive that includes internal and external candidates.   ''Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize,'' said Mr. Feidler, an Atlanta-based private equity executive.   But management changes alone are unlikely to quell the complaints of critics.   Multiple congressional committees are planning hearings into the breach and Equifax's response to it. More than 30 state law-enforcement authorities have opened inquiries, as has the F.B.I.   Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Tuesday that it is ''not real accountability if the guy promoted to chairman is an Equifax board member who served on the committee that was responsible for overseeing data security.''   The Equifax breach, which exposed the personal information of up to 143 million Americans, has cast a harsh spotlight on the company's governance.   Its board of directors largely consists of low-profile retired corporate executives. Half of the 10 outside board members are past or present fixtures of the Atlanta business community.   Mr. Smith, 57, took over as chief executive in 2005, after a 22-year career at General Electric in which he worked in the conglomerate's asset-management, insurance and leasing divisions. At Equifax, he presided over a period of rapidly growing sales, driven by expanding troves of sensitive personal data. Profits rose, and the stock price followed.   When the crisis hit, the company stumbled.   Its website repeatedly crashed as millions of desperate individuals tried to find out whether their information was part of the breach. People who were potentially affected were unable to sign up for protection the company was offering or, even if they had been successful, could not get the service activated. Equifax also charged many people to freeze their credit files before reversing course in the wake of fierce criticism.   In an early bid to contain the crisis, Equifax said on Sept. 14 that two top executives, its chief information officer and chief security officer, were stepping down.   But the storm was intensifying -- and the board decided it needed to take more drastic action.   Before the attack, the company would most likely have turned to its top executive ranks. One obvious candidate, Joseph M. Loughran III, runs Equifax's core credit reporting division and previously served as its chief marketing officer.   By the time Equifax's board meeting began last Wednesday evening, it was clear that Mr. Loughran and others were no longer in the running.   Three executives, including Mr. Loughran, had sold $1.8 million worth of shares in the days after the hack was discovered. The company says the executives who sold shares had not been aware of the breach at the time of the sales.   With a limited pool of candidates, the board turned to Mr. Barros, who joined Equifax in 2010 and was most recently based in Sydney, Australia. Before that, he had a long career working at telecommunications companies including BellSouth and AT&T.   ''He is an experienced leader with deep knowledge of our company and the industry,'' said Ines Gutzmer, an Equifax spokeswoman. ''The board of directors has absolute confidence in his ability to guide the company through this transition.''   Mr. Feidler, the new chairman, comes from a similar background as Mr. Barros. A longtime telecom executive and banker, Mr. Feidler was president and chief operating officer at BellSouth until its 2006 merger with AT&T. The following year, he co-founded the Atlanta private-equity firm MSouth Equity Partners.   Equifax's board has created a special committee to review the data breach. As part of his departure agreement, Mr. Smith agreed that Equifax can decide at a later date on the specific terms of his departure, based on the findings of the special committee.   ''Mr. Smith has been very cooperative and supportive of this approach,'' said Wyatt Jefferies, an Equifax spokesman.   Mr. Smith will retain about $18.4 million in pension benefits, according to a regulatory filing. He also holds around $20.8 million in stock awards, according to Equilar, which tracks executive compensation. Those shares would be forfeited if his termination is decided to have been for cause.   Mr. Smith owns Equifax shares worth $23.6 million. He received bonuses of roughly $3 million in 2015 and 2016, but agreed to waive any bonus for this year after the hack.   Mr. Smith had been scheduled to appear at two congressional hearings next week, but his departure raised questions about whether he could choose not to testify.   ''A C.E.O. walking out the door just days before he is to appear before Congress is an abdication of his responsibility,'' said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii.   Mr. Jefferies, the Equifax spokesman, indicated that Mr. Smith would still cooperate.   ''If Congress asks him, he will go,'' Mr. Jefferies said.     "
Tardy Disclosure of Own Data Breach Could Come Back to Haunt the S.E.C.,"Guess whose database was hacked, exposing sensitive information that could be used for illegal profit, but who failed to disclose that information to the public in a timely manner? If you picked Equifax, which disclosed a breach on Sept. 7 that resulted in the theft of personal financial information of as many as 143 million Americans, you would only be half right.    The Equifax hacking drew more attention because of its scope, but a potentially more threatening attack -- for those who know what to do with the information -- was the breach of the Securities and Exchange Commission electronic system known as Edgar, which receives 1.7 million corporate and securities filings a year.   In a late-evening statement last week, the S.E.C. chairman, Walter J. Clayton, said the commission learned last month that a digital breach it detected in 2016 ''may have provided the basis for illicit gain through trading.''    That information was buried in Mr. Clayton's statement, which otherwise appeared to concern the general matter of cybersecurity. In prepared testimony for his appearance on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, he said he did not learn of the breach until August, when the investigation of possible illegal trading was brought to his attention.   For an agency that prizes prompt disclosure of accurate information and has pursued enforcement cases for companies that fail to disclose or update information for investors, it appears that the S.E.C. could use a dose of its own medicine.   But the hacking is more than a simple stumble for the S.E.C. It has provided a road map for what compromised companies can say in the future -- using the S.E.C.'s own words -- and raised the question of how the commission would secure hugely valuable information if it succeeds in its goal of collecting even more of it.   In announcing the breach last week, Mr. Clayton noted that ''even the most diligent cybersecurity efforts will not address all cyberrisks that enterprises face.'' Those words are certain to be cited back to the S.E.C. by any company -- especially Equifax -- when questions are raised about the systems it uses to prevent digital attacks and make a timely disclosure to the public when they do occur.   The Edgar system has been misused before, including a 2015 scheme to manipulate the shares of Avon by filing a fake tender offer for the company that temporarily drove up the value of its shares. That is akin to a spam email or another type of spoof that has a modest impact on the market and does not raise questions about the probity of the financial system.   The more ominous message about the breach is that only recently has it come to light that the information may have been used to generate trading profit. Much of what is in the Edgar system is made available to the public, but any preview before the release of information can be turned into enormous profit now that trading strategies can be executed in milliseconds.   Although Mr. Clayton claimed that the hacking did not ''result in systemic risk,'' the misuse of confidential information -- especially when noticing it may have taken months -- threatens the integrity of the financial markets.   The use of stolen information from the Edgar system has been likened to insider trading, but there is a crucial difference when hacking is involved. Insider trading requires showing a violation of a fiduciary duty in misusing the information for personal gain, but hackers are thieves who are bound by no such fiduciary duty.   It is no surprise that the hackers are at risk of penalties -- in 2015, the Justice Department and the S.E.C. charged a group of Ukrainian hackers with fraud over trading on market-moving information before it was released to the public, generating profit of more than $100 million. A 2009 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan in S.E.C. v. Dorozhko allowed civil securities fraud charges to proceed against a hacker who gained access to a company's earnings report to trade on it before its release.   But what of those who might have acquired that information from them? For a start, they are not at risk of insider trading charges. And criminal charges could hinge on proving that they knew the information had been acquired illegally.   The insider trading laws do not apply because someone who acquired the information would not be what is known as a ''tippee'' under the fiduciary duty analysis. But prosecution is possible under a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 641, that makes it a crime to receive ''any record, voucher, money, or thing of value'' knowing it has been stolen and using it for personal gain.   That provision has been interpreted by the federal appeals courts to cover intangible property, so anyone buying confidential information from the Edgar database could come within this prohibition. Proving knowledge when someone buys stolen property can be a challenge because one can always profess ignorance, but prosecutors have had success in showing that a buyer was deliberately ignorant of how information had been acquired. Keeping your head in the sand does not mean you lacked the requisite intent.   For the S.E.C., the hacking makes protecting private information even more important as it embarks on creating a new database known as the Consolidated Audit Trail that will host a trove of information about every order in the securities and options markets, including the identity of each account holder. The goal is to open a window for the agency into whether there is any manipulation of the markets or to provide a means to determine the cause of trading disruptions, such as the ''flash crash'' in 2010, when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 600 points in a matter of minutes.   The C.A.T. will have enormous potential value -- far beyond what is in the Edgar database -- by potentially giving clues about the trading strategies of large investors, such as mutual funds and pensions, that buy and sell millions of shares daily. Imagine how much a peek at that information would be worth to traders looking to get out ahead of large transactions to profit from the small changes in stock prices when they hit the market.   The temptation to hack the database will be powerful, which means protecting it will be one of the S.E.C.'s highest priorities. Can the agency be trusted with that much valuable information? The industry has resisted the creation of the C.A.T., and the hacking at the S.E.C. will be an additional argument for those seeking to derail the program.   If Mr. Clayton is right that cyberattacks are going to happen even with the best defenses in place, then the small software flaws that hackers exploited at the S.E.C. and Equifax add fuel to the fire of doubt about how secure anyone's information can be.

High Tech Misses And Hits Of 2017,"Let's face it: Technology this year was one big ''fail'' after another. And the biggest loser from all of this was you. It's easy to count the ways that tech did you wrong, especially when it came to information security. On the other hand, there was also plenty of good technology this year that worked well and offered benefits for your money.    So here's a review of the tech in 2017 that needed the most fixing, and the tech that was actually fixed.   ______    Tech That Needed Fixing   Epic failures this year exposed your personal data to hackers, wasted your money on unnecessary or ethically dubious products and fed you misinformation.   Equifax   When security breaches happen, you typically just have to change your passwords or cancel your credit cards. But this year's hacking of Equifax, one of the three major consumer credit reporting agencies, was unprecedented.   Hackers exploited a weak point in website software to gain access to sensitive information like Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers for as many as 145 million Americans. What's worse is that nobody opted in to Equifax -- if you have any credit, you are probably part of the breach and vulnerable to identity theft.   The fallout will probably cause headaches for years. The best defense tactic is a hassle: You should freeze your credit with all three credit reporting agencies -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- because an identity thief could use your personal information to apply for credit at a lender or company that checks files with only one of the agencies. What's more, freezing your credit may require a small fee, and the same fees may apply to unfreezing it whenever you want to apply for new credit.   Equifax's top executives resigned after the scandal, but the company has yet to disclose what it will do to prevent another breach.   Juicero   Juicero, a Silicon Valley start-up that raised about $120 million from investors, went belly up this year. It makes the list of this year's tech failures because it created a kind of product that most of us never needed in the first place.   Juicero's product? It sold a $700 juicer with a twist: The fresh produce came packaged in proprietary bags, which the juicer could press with four tons of pressure to create the juice. Because the produce came in neat packages, it could be easily discarded, sparing enthusiasts the cleanup of a typical juicer (a chore that you can easily handle with a dishwashing machine).   Here's how we know that most of us didn't need this: Some Juicero investors told Bloomberg News that people could simply squeeze the juice bags with their hands and get roughly the same amount of juice -- sometimes even faster than the machine. (In our tests, a Juicero machine took more than three minutes to squeeze a bag of kale juice, but squeezing a bag by hand took about two minutes.) Over its short life span, the Juicero plummeted in price to $400 before the start-up shut down.   Uber   If you need a New Year's resolution, you might consider boycotting Uber.   To be clear, Uber's failures have more to do with the company and its work culture than the app you are familiar with. The ride-hailing start-up was a scandal magnet this year. After Uber employees aired complaints about sexual harassment, the company did an internal investigation and fired 20 people. The New York Times also reported that the company had used a secret program, code-named Greyball, to monitor and evade law enforcement officials.   It didn't end there. Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google's parent company, Alphabet, sued Uber, accusing it of stealing trade secrets. In addition, Uber recently disclosed that hackers stole 57 million driver and rider accounts in October 2016 -- after keeping the breach secret for more than a year.   Travis Kalanick resigned as the company's chief executive amid a shareholder revolt. Uber's new chief, Dara Khosrowshahi, now faces the tall order of repairing the company's reputation.   Fake Accounts on Twitter and Facebook   Remember all those hate tweets that you saw about Hillary Clinton? Many of them may have been fake.   In 2017, many of us found out that we have been unwitting readers of propaganda and fake news seeded by Russian agents. We saw the posts on tech platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google in 2016, which may have influenced how we voted during the presidential election. This year, investigations by The Times and the cybersecurity firm FireEye revealed that Russian operators had used hundreds of thousands of bots, or automated accounts pretending to be people, to post anti-Clinton messages.   Facebook and Twitter have said they are stepping up efforts to disable fake accounts. But the damage has been done. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and the social media sites did very little to prevent fake accounts from being created in the first place.   ______   Tech That Was Fixed   On the bright side, there were high-quality products that improved your mobile life and mobile security, your gaming experiences, and your home automation.   Smart Watches   When Apple Watch debuted in 2015, it wasn't a practical product for you to buy. The smart watch was sluggish, it required an iPhone to operate, battery life was dismal and the $10,000 price tag of the 18-karat gold model was outrageous.   But this year, Apple nailed it with the third iteration, the Apple Watch Series 3, which introduced optional cellular connectivity to make the watch work more independently from the iPhone.   An initial glitch caused the watch to occasionally lose cellular connection, but Apple quickly fixed the problem with a software update. More important, the new smart watch has exceptional battery life; in my tests, I had about 40 percent of battery life left, on average, after a full day of use. In addition, apps and features like the stopwatch and Siri work quickly.   This is the first smart watch that feels like a mature, well-executed product that you can buy with confidence.   Nintendo   For the last few years, your living room game console probably wasn't a Nintendo. The Japanese game company's previous console, the Wii U, was a flop.   But Nintendo Switch, the convertible console that debuted this year, was a hit. The device is essentially two gadgets in one -- both a console that can sit in your living room and one that you can easily take on the go. And the new Zelda and Mario games, among others, received glowing reviews.   People are loving it. Nintendo has sold 10 million Switch consoles since March. In comparison, the company sold 3.9 million Wii U systems in that console's first 10 months.   Smart Home   Year after year at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, start-ups have prophesied that everything in your home will be connected to the internet and automated with magical algorithms. That vision is finally becoming a reality.   These days, you can buy high-quality internet-connected home accessories, like light bulbs, thermostats and security cameras, that work well together and can easily be controlled with voice-powered virtual assistants including Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Apple's Siri.   The young smart home market is growing quickly. NPD Group, a research firm, says 15 percent of American households with an internet connection now own a home automation device, up from 10 percent in April 2016.   Face Recognition   For decades, scanning a face to unlock a gadget was a science fiction fantasy that you saw only in movies like ''Minority Report'' or ''The Incredibles.'' Many companies tried it with no success; the face recognition in Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, for example, could be tricked by holding a photograph of your face in front of the camera. Even worse, some older systems had problems identifying people with darker skin.   Then this year, iPhone X, Apple's first premium-tier iPhone priced at about $1,000, introduced Face ID.   The face-recognition system sprays an object with infrared dots and then stitches the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it. Face ID learns more about your face over time so that it continues to work when your face changes, like when you are growing facial hair or wearing a hat or scarf. Face ID is the first example of reliable, secure face recognition on a mainstream device.     "
Mr. Trump's Dangerous Indifference,"A rival foreign power launched an aggressive cyberattack on the United States, interfering with the 2016 presidential election and leaving every indication that it's coming back for more -- but President Trump doesn't seem to care. The unprecedented nature of Russia's attack is getting lost in the swirling chaos of recent weeks, but it shouldn't be. American intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia took direct aim at the integrity of American democracy, and yet after almost five months in office, the commander in chief appears unconcerned with that threat to our national security. The only aspect of the Russia story that attracts his attention is the threat it poses to the perceived legitimacy of his electoral win.     If not for the continuing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians -- and whether Mr. Trump himself has obstructed that investigation -- the president's indifference would be front-page news.   So let's take a moment to recall the sheer scope and audacity of the Russian efforts.   Under direct orders from President Vladimir Putin, hackers connected to Russian military intelligence broke into the email accounts of senior officials at the Democratic National Committee and of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta. They passed tens of thousands of emails to the website WikiLeaks, which posted them throughout the last months of the campaign in an attempt to damage the Clinton campaign.   Even more disturbing, hackers sought access to voter databases in at least 39 states, and in some cases tried to alter or delete voter data. They also appear to have tried to take over the computers of more than 100 local election officials in the days before the Nov. 8 vote.   There is no evidence that these efforts affected the outcome of the election. But that's beside the point. The Russians have engaged in behavior like this in other countries, and they're getting better at it. An American presidential election may be their biggest target to date, but it's hardly their first. In the last decade they have hacked computer networks in Estonia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany, France, and Bulgaria -- often stealing data. They have disseminated fake news stories and other disinformation to interfere with elections in other countries, as they did here.   It's a global threat, and serious people treat it that way. In December, President Barack Obama responded by punishing Mr. Putin with a new round of sanctions, expelling dozens of suspected Russian intelligence operatives and barring access to estates they used for intelligence activities. On June 14, the Senate voted 97 to 2 to block Mr. Trump from lifting those sanctions unilaterally. Meanwhile, a majority of Americans accept the intelligence community's consensus that Russia interfered with the election.   Yet Mr. Trump has been dismissive at best. As a candidate, he encouraged Russian hackers to find thousands of emails that he said Mrs. Clinton had illegally deleted. His response as president-elect to the reports that Russia had attempted to swing the election in his favor was to challenge the intelligence community's credibility and say it was time ''to move on.''   Even after taking office, he has remained skeptical. In a phone call with the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, he ''questioned the veracity'' of the finding of Russian interference, according to The Wall Street Journal.   When James Comey, the former F.B.I. director whom Mr. Trump fired in May, was asked during his Senate testimony this month whether President Trump had ever inquired about the interference campaign itself -- as opposed to how the investigation into it might affect him personally -- he said, ''No.''   In other words, to the extent that Mr. Trump countenances the idea of a Russian attack, he seems to regard it as all about him. The ''obsession'' with it, he claims, is driven by Democrats upset over losing an election they expected to win.   This is demonstrably false. It also ignores the true threat. As Mr. Comey said of the attack: ''It's not a Republican thing or Democratic thing. It really is an American thing. They're going to come for whatever party they choose to try and work on behalf of. And they're not devoted to either, in my experience. They're just about their own advantage. And they will be back.''   Even if the investigations find no evidence that Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with the Russians, the president's refusal to accept the truth about this attack on our democracy denies reality and leaves the country vulnerable to more damaging attacks. The true obsession is Mr. Trump's, with his own brand, and it's distracting him from his most important duty -- to protect the nation.

Bitcoin Basics: Why Hackers Demand It and How It Works,"As the hackers behind the global ransomware attack demand payment in Bitcoin, here is a look at the basics behind the electronic currency. Why are hackers using Bitcoin?    The digital currency Bitcoin has emerged as a favorite tool for hackers demanding a ransom for a simple reason: You can start accepting Bitcoin anywhere in the world without having to reveal your identity.   For criminals, this makes Bitcoin much more attractive than systems like Western Union, which generally require customers to provide identification before opening an account and receiving transferred money.    What is Bitcoin?   Bitcoin is a digital token that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world.   Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which the Bitcoin digital tokens move. Some people differentiate between Bitcoin capitalized, as the token, and bitcoin lowercase, as the network. Unlike traditional payment networks like Visa or American Express, no single company or person runs the Bitcoin network. Instead, it is a decentralized network of computers around the world that keep track of all Bitcoin transactions, similar to the decentralized network of servers that makes the internet work.   Because there is no central authority running Bitcoin, no one has the authority to force new users to reveal their identities. The network was designed this way to create a currency and a financial network outside the control of any government or single company.   The computers that join the network and track Bitcoin transactions are motivated to do so by the new coins that are released to the network every 10 minutes and are given to one of the computers helping to track the transactions and maintain the network.   How do you buy and receive Bitcoin?   There are companies in most countries that will sell you Bitcoin in exchange for the local currency. In the United States, a company called Coinbase will link to your bank account or credit card and then sell you the coins for American dollars. Opening an account with Coinbase is similar to opening a traditional bank or stock brokerage account, with lots of verification of your identity needed.   For people who do not want to reveal their identities, there are services like LocalBitcoins that will connect local people who want to buy and sell Bitcoin for cash, generally without any verification of identity required.   To start accepting Bitcoin is even easier. One needs only to create a Bitcoin address, which can be done anonymously by anyone with internet access.   The price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly and is determined by open-market bidding on Bitcoin exchanges, similar to the way that stock and gold prices are determined by bidding on exchanges.   Can the authorities track criminals using Bitcoin?   All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the network's public ledger, known as the blockchain. Law enforcement or financial authorities can sometimes use the blockchain to track transactions among criminals. But as long as the criminals do not associate a real-world identity with their Bitcoin address, they are generally safe. Complicating matters further, there are increasingly sophisticated Bitcoin laundering services, known as tumblers, which mix large quantities of transactions together in order to make it harder for the authorities to track the transactions.   Where it can get more difficult for hackers is when they want to convert the Bitcoin they have received into a traditional national currency. Most companies that convert Bitcoin to dollars in the United States require that their customers provide identification. If a criminal registered with a company like that, it would be relatively easy for the police to track them down.   But there are many Bitcoin exchanges outside the United States that do not require customers to register with a real-world identity. LocalBitcoins also makes it easy to find someone in any city around the world who will meet you in person and pay cash for Bitcoin without requiring any identification -- a sort of Craigslist for Bitcoin exchanges. It is also getting easier to buy goods online using Bitcoin, without ever converting the digital currency into dollars or euros.   What's happening with the price of Bitcoin?   The price of Bitcoin has recently hit a high above $1,800. Like gold, the price of Bitcoin has always been driven by the scarcity of the digital tokens. When Bitcoin was created in 2009, it was determined that only 21 million coins would ever be created.   Technology investors have purchased coins and pushed up the price out of a belief that the tokens and the system will be a sort of global digital currency and financial network for the future.   While real-world transactions have been slow to take off, Bitcoin has continued to be popular for black market uses like ransomware and online drug markets like the Silk Road and its successors.   The corporate world has also taken interest in the technology that enables Bitcoin, especially its decentralized financial network and the blockchain, the global ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Many banks are making big bets that real-world financial transactions will one day be run on networks similar to Bitcoin, which can operate more quickly, efficiently and securely than traditional financial networks.   There are now many competitors to Bitcoin, like Ethereum, and their value has also been pushed up by growing interest in the Bitcoin technology. But Bitcoin has remained the largest so-called cryptocurrency and is generally the one that people use to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies.   What are the currency's origins?   Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a shadowy creator going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, who only communicated by email and social messaging. While several people have been identified as likely candidates to be Satoshi, as the creator is known in the world of Bitcoin, not one has been confirmed. So the search for Satoshi has gone on.   Satoshi created the original rules of the Bitcoin network and then released the software to the world in 2009. Whether it is he, she or they, Satoshi largely disappeared from view two years later. Anyone can download and use the software, and Satoshi now has no more control over the network than anyone else using the software.     "
"Bitcoin Exchange Was Nexus of Crime, Indictment Says","A Russian man was charged with overseeing a black market Bitcoin exchange that helped launder billions of dollars and stood at the nexus of several criminal enterprises, according to a federal indictment. The indictment, which was unsealed in California on Wednesday, gave a long list of illegal activities that the Bitcoin exchange, known as BTC-E, facilitated, including ransomware fraud, identity theft, drug trafficking and public corruption.    The Russian man charged in the case, Alexander Vinnik, 37, was arrested in Greece on Tuesday. Mr. Vinnik had ''directed and supervised'' BTC-E's operations, according to the indictment, and is said to have had co-conspirators.    Criminals who stole or extorted Bitcoin from their victims would transfer the virtual currencies to BTC-E, which would then convert the virtual currency into traditional currency using a host of bank accounts registered under shell companies.   Justice Department officials said that the exchange appeared to have been responsible for laundering more than $4 billion for criminals, with most of the money turned into American dollars and Russian rubles.   The site served 700,000 customers around the world, the officials said.   Users of BTC-E had noted this week that the exchange's website was down, though the site's administrators had said on social media that they were working to get it back up.   The arrest of Mr. Vinnik came shortly after law enforcement authorities in the United States and Europe took down two big online drug markets in which Bitcoin was the primary currency.   Within the Bitcoin community, it has been common knowledge that drug dealers could use BTC-E to turn their Bitcoin proceeds into dollars.   The indictment may offer an explanation for a shock to the digital coin market in 2014. Mr. Vinnik and his partners are accused of stealing funds from the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which declared bankruptcy in 2014 after disclosing a hacker intrusion.   Mt. Gox's chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said that year that it had lost more than 800,000 Bitcoins, some of which the company later said it had recovered.   The indictment unsealed on Wednesday said that hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins moved from Mt. Gox into accounts at BTC-E that were directly controlled by Mr. Vinnik.   The stolen Bitcoins were then moved to a different virtual currency exchange, Bitstamp, and sold for traditional currencies, which were deposited in bank accounts that Mr. Vinnik controlled in Latvia and Cyprus.   At least 300,000 Bitcoins followed this path. Those coins would be worth nearly $800 million today.   Soon after news of Mr. Vinnik's arrest became public, WizSec, a Japanese computer security firm that has been tracking the Mt. Gox theft, announced that it had traced the stolen funds to Mr. Vinnik and had provided its findings to law enforcement authorities.   WizSec said on Wednesday that the theft of Mt. Gox's funds began in September 2011 and continued until 2014, with most of the money ending up at BTC-E. The report from WizSec appeared to be the most complete explanation yet of the theft.   BTC-E was founded in 2011, just as Bitcoin began to gain significant value for the first time. The identity of the exchange's operators was kept secret, even as other large Bitcoin exchanges tried to make their businesses more transparent and friendly to regulators.   BTC-E announced on its website that the exchange was complying with regulators by collecting identifying documents from all of its customers. In practice, however, BTC-E did not require anything from customers opening a new account, the indictment said.   BTC-E customers kept accounts under user names like ''CocaineCowbays,'' ''ISIS'' and ''dzkillerhacker,'' according to the indictment.     "
"What Is Bitcoin, and How Does It Work?","If you find the concept of Bitcoin confusing, you are not alone. The virtual currency has been a constant source of controversy, but it is still not well understood. Are Bitcoins those coins I see in photographs?    No. Those coins are novelty items that newspapers used in photographs because they couldn't find anything else to illustrate their stories about Bitcoin.   A Bitcoin is a digital token -- with no physical backing -- that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. A Bitcoin can be divided out to eight decimal places, so you can send someone 0.00000001 Bitcoins. This smallest fraction of a Bitcoin -- the penny of the Bitcoin world -- is referred to as a Satoshi, after the anonymous creator of Bitcoin.    This all gets confusing, because Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which the Bitcoin digital tokens are stored and moved.   Unlike traditional payment networks like Visa, the Bitcoin network is not run by a single company or person. The system is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world that keep track of all Bitcoin transactions, similar to the way Wikipedia is maintained by a decentralized network of writers and editors.   The record of all Bitcoin transactions that these computers are constantly updating is known as the blockchain.   Why do criminals like Bitcoin?   Criminals have taken to Bitcoin because anyone can open a Bitcoin address and start sending and receiving Bitcoins without giving a name or identity. There is no central authority that could collect this information.   Bitcoin first took off in 2011 after drug dealers began taking payments in Bitcoin on the black-market website known as the Silk Road. Although the Silk Road was shut down in 2013, similar sites have popped up to replace it.   More recently, Bitcoin has become a method for making ransom payments -- for example, when your computer is taken over by so-called ransomware.   Why won't the government just shut it down?   The records of the Bitcoin network, including all balances and transactions, are stored on every computer helping to maintain the network -- about 9,500 computers in late 2017.   If the government made it illegal for Americans to participate in this network, the computers and people keeping the records in other countries would still be able to continue. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin is also one of the qualities that have made it popular with people who are suspicious of government authorities.   Can Bitcoin users give themselves more Bitcoins?   Anyone helping to maintain the database of all Bitcoin transactions -- the blockchain -- could change his or her own copy of the records to add more money. But if someone did that, the other computers maintaining the records would see the discrepancy, and the changes would be ignored.   Are there legal uses?   Only a small percentage of all transactions on the Bitcoin network are explicitly illegal. Most transactions are people buying and selling Bitcoins on exchanges, speculating on future prices. A whole world of high-frequency traders has sprung up around Bitcoin.   People in countries with high inflation, like Argentina and Venezuela, have bought Bitcoin with their local currency to avoid losing their savings to inflation.   One of the most popular business plans is to use Bitcoin to move money over international borders. Large international money transfers can take weeks when they go through banks, while millions of dollars of Bitcoin can be moved in minutes. So far, though, these practical applications of Bitcoin have been slow to take off.   How can I buy a Bitcoin?   There are companies in most countries that will sell you Bitcoins in exchange for the local currency. In the United States, a company called Coinbase will link to your bank account or credit card and then sell you the coins for dollars. Opening an account with Coinbase is similar to opening a traditional bank or stock brokerage account, with lots of identity verification to satisfy the authorities.   For people who do not want to reveal their identities, services like LocalBitcoins will connect people who want to meet in person to buy and sell Bitcoins for cash, generally without any verification of identity required.   Who decides what a Bitcoin is worth?   The price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly and is determined by open-market bidding on Bitcoin exchanges, similar to the way that stock and gold prices are determined by bidding on exchanges.   What is Bitcoin mining?   Bitcoin mining refers to the process through which new Bitcoins are created and given to computers helping to maintain the network. The computers involved in Bitcoin mining are in a sort of computational race to process new transactions coming onto the network. The winner -- generally the person with the fastest computers -- gets a chunk of new Bitcoins, 12.5 of them right now. (The reward is halved every four years.)   There is generally a new winner about every 10 minutes, and there will be until there are 21 million Bitcoins in the world. At that point, no new Bitcoins will be created. This cap is expected to be reached in 2140. So far, about 16 million Bitcoin have been distributed.   Every Bitcoin in existence was created through this method and initially given to a computer helping to maintain the records. Anyone can set his or her computer to mine Bitcoin, but these days only people with specialized hardware manage to win the race.   Are there Bitcoin competitors?   Plenty. But these other virtual currencies do not have as many followers as Bitcoin, so they are not worth as much. As in the real world, a currency is worth only as much as the number of people willing to accept it for goods and services.   Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?   Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by an unknown creator going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, who communicated only by email and social messaging. While several people have been identified as likely candidates to be Satoshi, as the creator is known in the world of Bitcoin, no one has been confirmed as the real Satoshi, and the search has gone on.   Satoshi created the original rules of the Bitcoin network and then released the software to the world in 2009. Satoshi largely disappeared from view two years later. Anyone can download and use the software, and Satoshi now has no more control over the network than anyone else using the software.     "
Hackers Squeeze Hotel by Locking Doors,"Follow Dan Bilefsky on Twitter @DanBilefsky. The ransom demand arrived one recent morning by email, after about a dozen guests were locked out of their rooms at the lakeside Alpine hotel in Austria. The electronic key system at the picturesque Romantik Seehotel Jaegerwirt had been infiltrated, and the hotel was locked out of its own computer system, leaving guests stranded in the lobby, causing confusion and panic.    ''Good morning?'' the email began, according to the hotel's managing director, Christoph Brandstaetter. It went on to demand a ransom of two Bitcoins, or about $1,800, and warned that the cost would double if the hotel did not comply with the demand by the end of the day, Jan. 22.    Mr. Brandstaetter said the email included details of a ''Bitcoin wallet'' -- the account in which to deposit the money -- and ended with the words, ''Have a nice day!''   With the 111-year-old hotel brimming with eager skiers, hikers and vacationers, some having paid about $530 for a suite with a panoramic view and sauna, Mr. Brandstaetter said he decided to cave in.   Guests had already complained that their electronic room keys were not working, and receptionists' efforts to create new ones had proved futile. Bashing down the doors was not an option.   The reservation system for the hotel in the village of Turracherhöhe, about 90 minutes by car from Salzburg, was paralyzed.   ''We were at maximum capacity with 180 guests and decided that it was better to give in,'' he said. ''The hackers were very pushy.''   Security experts said the attack on the hotel appeared to be a novel example of an increasingly malicious and prevalent type of modern-day piracy.   The weapon? A type of software known as ransomware.   The crime is as simple as it is mendacious. Victims typically receive an email with a link or attachment that contains software that encrypts files on their computer and holds them hostage until they pay a ransom. Many of the hackers who carry out such attacks operate in Russia and Eastern Europe, according to the police, and often demand a ransom in Bitcoin, a digital currency that is hard to trace.   ''Ransomware is becoming a pandemic,'' said Tony Neate, a former British police officer who investigated cybercrime for 15 years. ''With the internet, anything can be switched on and off, from computers to cameras to baby monitors.''   Still, he added, ''hacking a hotel and locking people out of their rooms is a new line of attack.''   Mr. Neate, now chief executive of Get Safe Online, a government-backed security charity in Britain, said that demands in ransomware schemes were usually low enough that victims would acquiesce. As a result, however, hackers waged dozens of attacks a day to make them financially viable.   He nevertheless counseled victims not to pay, arguing that that would only further encourage more attacks and that the funds used to pay the ransom would bankroll nefarious activity, including possibly terrorism. Hotels, he warned, should also guard against copycat crimes by reinforcing their digital security.   According to the United States Justice Department, ransomware attacks quadrupled in 2016 to an average of 4,000 a day. The F.B.I. said the costs to victims of such attacks rose to $209 million in the first three months of 2016, compared with $24 million throughout 2015.   It is a sign of the crime's sinister proliferation that it has also entered popular culture.   In an episode of the legal drama ''The Good Wife,'' a Russian hacker attacked a law firm in the middle of a prominent case, encrypting its files and demanding a $50,000 ransom. The hacker eventually relented after the firm turned the tables by infecting the extortionist's computer with propaganda criticizing Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin.   In the real world, however, many have been forced to pay up.   Last year, hospitals in California and Kentucky were targeted in ransomware attacks. In one case, a Los Angeles hospital paid more than $17,000 to hackers to restore its computer network, and all of its digital medical files. Other victims in Europe and the United States have included a  municipal utility, companies, schools, law firms and police departments.   A recent study by the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, a Washington-based organization focusing on cybersecurity, noted that ransomware threatened to ''wreak havoc on America's critical infrastructure community'' and called it the digital equivalent of a ''centuries old criminal tactic.''   Mr. Brandstaetter said he had decided to go public with the attack at his hotel so that others would be more vigilant.   To guard against future attacks, however, he said the Romantik Seehotel Jaegerwirt was considering replacing its electronic keys with old-fashioned door locks and real keys of the type used when his great-grandfather founded the hotel.   ''The securest way not to get hacked,'' he said, ''is to be offline and to use keys.''     "
Fearmongering at Homeland Security,"The United States is as vulnerable to an attack today as it was the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. Information in the press about national security is misleading or flat-out wrong, offering a false sense of security. The men and women of the Department of Homeland Security perform heroic work day and night for a largely ungrateful nation. If members of Congress are unhappy with the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, they should pass new laws or ''shut up.'' Those were the main takeaways from Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly's first extensive remarks about how he intends to lead a vast bureaucracy on the front lines of immigration enforcement, passenger screening and cybersecurity.     ''Make no mistake,'' he said Tuesday during a speech at George Washington University. ''We are in fact a nation under attack.''   Of course it is necessary to take seriously threats from extremist groups and criminals, and take measures against them. But they do not justify Mr. Kelly's incendiary message to his work force. The tone he sets can only encourage abusive behavior among his officers further down the chain of command against immigrants, and also lead to the curtailment of Americans' civil liberties and privacy.   Mr. Kelly said that Americans have grown complacent because their government has done such a good job of keeping them safe. The reality, he warned, is quite different: ''We are under attack from terrorism both within and outside of our borders. These men and women are without conscience, and they operate without rules. They despise the United States, because we are a nation of rights, of laws and of freedoms. They have a single mission, and that is our destruction.''   That apocalyptic talk turns the Islamophobia and immigrant scapegoating that turbocharged the Trump campaign into marching orders for federal law enforcement agents and bureaucrats. It ignores that the United States has spent billions of dollars over the past 15 years greatly enhancing its intelligence collection capabilities and that it has put in place far more stringent mechanisms to screen visa applicants and visitors.   Disregarding these gains, Mr. Kelly and other top administration officials stand to make the country less safe with talk of a war on unauthorized immigrants, which is driving segments of immigrant communities underground, making them fearful of any encounters with law enforcement. The bashing of Muslims, meanwhile, is music to the ears of extremist, violent organizations that have used the notion that America is at war with Islam as a recruiting tool.   Mr. Kelly's prepared remarks also telegraphed more drastic measures to come. He said a new restriction on carrying laptops and tablets onto some flights from Muslim-majority countries ''will likely expand,'' citing, vaguely, ''the sophisticated threats aviation faces.'' America's cyberdefenses can no longer rely on ''muskets,'' but instead need ''heavy artillery.''   Mr. Kelly dismissed critics who have lamented his stated willingness to separate immigrant mothers and children caught entering the country, claiming that this unfathomably cruel threat would be, and indeed already has been, a useful disincentive for would-be migrants.   Among the more jarring parts of Mr. Kelly's speech was his message to lawmakers. Citing the low morale of employees he described as ''political pawns'' in the nation's contentious immigration debate, Mr. Kelly said members of Congress should have ''the courage and the skill to change those laws,'' or ''shut up and support the men and women on the front lines'' of immigration enforcement.   Mr. Kelly's choice of words reflects the dismal state of public discourse in American politics. That brusqueness encourages lawmakers to respond in kind, which can only make policy making more fraught and partisan. But even more alarming is his unrestrained fearmongering. If Americans take his discourse at face value, they will be living in a paranoid society willing to trade fundamental freedoms and principles for a sense of security.     "
Equifax Attack Exposes Data Of 143 Million,"Equifax, one of the three major consumer credit reporting agencies, said on Thursday that hackers had gained access to company data that potentially compromised sensitive information for 143 million American consumers, including Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. The attack on the company represents one of the largest risks to personally sensitive information in recent years, and is the third major cybersecurity threat for the agency since 2015.    Equifax, based in Atlanta, is a particularly tempting target for hackers. If identity thieves wanted to hit one place to grab all the data needed to do the most damage, they would go straight to one of the three major credit reporting agencies.   ''This is about as bad as it gets,'' said Pamela Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit research group. ''If you have a credit report, chances are you may be in this breach. The chances are much better than 50 percent.''    Criminals gained access to certain files in the company's system from mid-May to July by exploiting a weak point in website software, according to an investigation by Equifax and security consultants. The company said that it discovered the intrusion on July 29 and has since found no evidence of unauthorized activity on its main consumer or commercial credit reporting databases.   In addition to the other material, hackers were also able to retrieve names, birth dates and addresses. Credit card numbers for 209,000 consumers were stolen, while documents with personal information used in disputes for 182,000 people were also taken.   Other cyberattacks, such as the two breaches that Yahoo announced in 2016, have eclipsed the penetration at Equifax in sheer size, but the Equifax attack is worse in terms of severity. Thieves were able to siphon far more personal information -- the keys that unlock consumers' medical histories, bank accounts and employee accounts.   ''On a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of risk to consumers, this is a 10,'' said Avivah Litan, a fraud analyst at Gartner.   An F.B.I. spokesperson said the agency was aware of the breach and was tracking the situation.   Last year, identity thieves successfully made off with critical W-2 tax and salary data from an Equifax website. And earlier this year, thieves again stole W-2 tax data from an Equifax subsidiary, TALX, which provides online payroll, tax and human resources services to some of the nation's largest corporations.   Cybersecurity professionals criticized Equifax on Thursday for not improving its security practices after those previous thefts, and they noted that thieves were able to get the company's crown jewels through a simple website vulnerability.   ''Equifax should have multiple layers of controls'' so if hackers manage to break in, they can at least be stopped before they do too much damage, Ms. Litan said.   Potentially adding to criticism of the company, three senior executives, including the company's chief financial officer, John Gamble, sold shares worth almost $1.8 million in the days after the breach was discovered. The shares were not part of a sale planned in advance, Bloomberg reported.   The company handles data on more than 820 million consumers and more than 91 million businesses worldwide and manages a database with employee information from more than 7,100 employers, according to its website.   Equifax also houses much of the data that is supposed to be a backstop against security breaches. The agency offers a service that provides companies with the questions and answers needed for their account recovery, in the event customers lose access to their accounts.   ''If that information is breached, you've lost that backstop,'' said Patrick Harding, the chief technology officer at Ping Identity, a Denver-based identity management company.   Equifax said that, in addition to reporting the breach to law enforcement, it had hired a cybersecurity firm to conduct a review to determine the scale of the invasion. The investigation is expected to wrap up in the next few weeks.   ''This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do,'' Richard F. Smith, chairman and chief executive of Equifax, said in a statement. ''Confronting cybersecurity risks is a daily fight.''   Using the data stolen from Equifax, identity thieves can impersonate people with lenders, creditors and service providers, who rely on personal identity information from Equifax to make financial decisions regarding potential customers.   Equifax has created a website, www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, to help consumers determine whether their data was at risk.   People can go to the Equifax website to see if their information has been compromised. The site encourages customers to offer their last name and the last six digits of their Social Security number. When they do, however, they do not necessarily get confirmation about whether they were affected. Instead, the site provides an enrollment date for its protection service, and it may not start for several days.   The company also suggests getting a free copy of your credit report from the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. These are available at annualcreditreport.com. It also suggests contacting a law enforcement agency if you believe any stolen information has already been used in some way.   Equifax's credit protection service, which is free for one year for consumers who enroll by Nov. 21, is available to everyone and not just the victims of the breach.   Equifax is offering consumers the ability to freeze their Equifax credit reports, said John Ulzheimer, a consumer credit expert who often does expert witness work for banks and credit unions and worked at Equifax in the 1990s. Thieves could have information stolen from Equifax and used it to open accounts with creditors that use Experian or TransUnion.   ''It's like locking one of three doors in your house and leaving the other two unlocked,'' Mr. Ulzheimer said. ''You're hoping the thief stumbles on the locked door.'' He recommended that all those affected immediately place a fraud alert on all three of their credit files, which anyone can do for free.   Equifax's offer of one year of free protection falls short of what consumers really need, because their information can be bought and sold by hackers for years to come, Mr. Ulzheimer added.   Beyond compromising the personal data of millions of consumers, the breach also poses a potential national security threat. In recent years, Chinese nation-state hackers have breached insurers like Anthem and federal agencies, siphoning detailed personal and medical information. These hackers go wide in their assaults in an effort to build databases of Americans' personal information, which can be used for blackmail or future attacks.   Governments regularly buy stolen personal information on the so-called Dark Web, security experts say. The black market sites where this information is sold are far more exclusive than black markets where stolen credit card data is sold. Interested buyers are even asked to submit to background checks before they are admitted.   ''Cyberwar is in large part conducted through data mining and cyberintelligence,'' Ms. Litan said. ''This is also a Homeland Security risk as enemy nation states build databases of Americans that they then use to get to their targets, for example a network operator at a power grid, or a defense contractor at a missile defense company.''   Sen. Mark R. Warner, a Virginia Democrat who co-founded the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, said he believed the severity of the Equifax breach raised serious questions about whether Congress needed to rethink data protection policies.   ''It is no exaggeration to suggest that a breach such as this -- exposing highly sensitive personal and financial information central for identity management and access to credit -- represents a real threat to the economic security of Americans,'' he said in a statement.     "
Cuomo Offers Stricter Rules For Credit Reporting Firms,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, responding to the massive security breach at Equifax, will propose regulations on Monday that subject credit reporting agencies to the same rules as banks and insurances companies in order to protect consumers.  The proposal would require companies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion to register with the state's Department of Financial Services, whose superintendent will have broad powers to deny or revoke their authorization to do business in the state, or to sue, if a company fails to comply or engages in prohibited practices deemed unfair, deceptive or predatory. Senior administration officials said the proposed regulations would, in effect, make it illegal for unregistered credit reporting agencies to compile reports on consumers in New York or to collect fees from banks for their services.    The move comes after Equifax, based in Atlanta, announced last week that hackers had gained access to sensitive personal information for 143 million consumers and made off with over 200,000 credit card numbers. The episode highlighted gaps in regulation that allow credit reporting agencies to warehouse consumer information like names, addresses and Social Security numbers without rigorous oversight for how that data is collected, protected and used.   Mr. Cuomo said in a statement that the breach was ''a wake-up call,'' and added that he hoped the regulations will be replicated nationwide.   ''A person's credit history affects virtually every part of their lives and we will not sit idly by while New Yorkers remain unprotected from cyber attacks due to lax security,'' he said. ''Oversight of credit reporting agencies will help ensure that personal information is less vulnerable to cyberattacks and other nefarious acts in the new frontier of a rapidly changing digital world.''   Under the regulations, credit reporting agencies must register by Feb. 1 each year, using forms that require them to list all officers who will be responsible for compliance. The companies will also be required to comply with cybersecurity regulations that went into effect this spring for financial services providers.   The cybersecurity regulations require financial institutions to implement a program for protecting consumer data. The companies must also appoint or designate a chief information security officer and report breaches, attempted or successful, to the regulator.   Administration officials said they expected the proposal to be adopted within 60 days, after a public comment period has ended.   The information that credit reporting agencies collect hold the keys to Americans' bank accounts and medical histories. Although the companies sit on a wealth of information, they are not subject to the kind of constant monitoring and auditing that the government uses to secure banks and insurance companies.   The risks were highlighted by the Equifax breach, which led two senior executives responsible for security in information technology to retire on Friday. The company is investigating the scope and cause of the intrusion.   The hackers, who have not been identified, exploited a known security loophole in software that Equifax uses on its website, prompting questions about why the company did not make a fix that could have prevented the attack.   Equifax is facing legal threats and backlash from consumers, investors and policy makers. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman is investigating the breach, and at least two class-action lawsuits are pending against the company, whose shares have tumbled 35 percent since Sept. 7.     "
S.E.C. Cyber Rules Are Falling Short,"At first glance, the hacking disclosed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday didn't seem too much of a concern to investors. The intrusion, after all, appeared to be limited to the S.E.C.'s database of corporate filings, like annual and quarterly financial reports and proxy statements.    While the S.E.C. said it believed that the attack ''did not result in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, jeopardize the operations of the commission, or result in systemic risk,'' the agency did acknowledge that the hackers could have profited by trading on the corporate data they gleaned.    Still, said Jay Clayton, the S.E.C. chairman, the episode ''highlighted the importance of cybersecurity to the agency and market participants.''   I'll say.   The lapse at the S.E.C. and the breach before it at Equifax, the credit monitoring agency, should both be wake-up calls for investors who regularly trade stocks. In fact, these breakdowns raise questions about significant gaps in the S.E.C.'s computer security rules for stock exchanges and certain other significant trading platforms.   As a result of these holes, investors' trades on certain venues may be more vulnerable to hacking than on others. And because of the interconnectedness of the technologies supporting the nation's stock trading systems, hackers gaining access to one venue could easily disrupt entire swaths of the market.   The concerns center on an S.E.C. rule written in 2014 that was intended to strengthen the technological underpinnings of the United States securities markets, making them safer for investors.   The rule, known as Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity, or Reg SCI, came after a series of troubling market system failures. One was the $440 million glitch in 2012 at Knight Capital, a big stock trading firm. Other technical breakdowns occurred the next year on Nasdaq; on one occasion, all trading in that market was halted for three hours.   The S.E.C. rule required exchanges and certain other trading venues to have comprehensive procedures ensuring ''the robustness and resiliency of their technological systems.''   Bolstering cybersecurity measures was a component of the rule. Stock exchanges like IEX, Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange had to comply with the new requirements and make their operations available for audits by the S.E.C. These exchanges also had to tell the commission when problems arose, including system intrusions, a crucial mechanism for investor protection.   But many large trading venues did not have to comply with the rule. Among them were firms that buy stock orders from retail brokerage firms, known as wholesalers or internalizers. Certain alternative trading systems were also let off the hook, including some that are operated by large brokerage companies like Morgan Stanley.   Among the entities that don't have to adhere to the cybersecurity rule are firms that handle vast volumes of trades in the nation's equity markets. Citadel Securities, the broker-dealer unit of the powerhouse founded by Kenneth Griffin, is an example.   A division of the company -- Citadel Execution Services -- is what's known as a wholesale firm. It buys investors' orders from retail brokerage firms that don't have their own trading operations and executes the transactions against stocks it holds in inventory. Some 200 brokerage firms, including Charles Schwab, Scottrade and E-Trade, sell their customers' orders to Citadel.   These firms send Citadel almost three million equity orders a day totaling almost 1.7 billion shares, according to figures cited in an S.E.C. enforcement action filed against the firm in January. These orders accounted for about 35 percent of the average daily volume of retail stock trades in the United States, the S.E.C. said.   It seems odd, given the volume of trades handled by Citadel, that the S.E.C. would not require the firm to follow its heightened cybersecurity rules. So I asked the S.E.C. about this decision. A spokeswoman declined to comment.   I also asked Citadel about its internal protections against cyberattacks. A spokesman declined to comment.   A spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment about precautions the bank had taken against digital attacks on their alternative trading systems. But since the company qualifies as a systemically important financial institution in regulators' eyes, at least its operations are watched more closely.   Also disquieting about the rule: Nowhere does the agency publish the list of entities that comply with the systems integrity rule. If this regulation was supposed to protect investors, as the S.E.C. contended when it put it into effect, why aren't investors allowed to know which trading venues have strong cybersystems in place and which may not?   This question may come up on Thursday, when Mr. Clayton, the S.E.C. chairman, is scheduled to testify before the Senate banking committee. One of the committee's members, Mark R. Warner, a Virginia Democrat who is a co-founder of the bipartisan Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, recently expressed his concern over the lack of transparency in the rule.   ''Investors are unable to determine whether their orders are being routed to market centers which are being held to the requirement of having a strong, audited cybersecurity program,'' Mr. Warner wrote in a letter to Mr. Clayton on Aug. 1. ''If compromised, these market centers could destabilize markets by not having the protections in place that the S.E.C. has outlined in Reg SCI to strengthen the integrity of our markets.''   The S.E.C. was right to require market trading venues to tighten their security systems. Investors rely heavily on these entities.   But exempting major firms may mean it did only half the job. And surely investors have the right to know which firms are meeting the heightened standards.   Mr. Warner thinks so. ''Efforts to strengthen our nation's financial infrastructure, such as Reg SCI, are critical to financial stability and the security of our country,'' he said in a statement on Thursday. ''Providing investors with information about which market centers are subject to Reg SCI and whether they are in compliance would encourage market center adoption of strong cybersecurity standards and help investors protect themselves from cyberrisks.''

Spotting the Phish in a Sea of Email,"Q. I got a message asking me to verify a new Dropbox account, but I never signed up for Dropbox. I suspect this is a hoax, but I looked at the return address and it seems to be pointing to Dropbox itself. Has my email account been hacked?  A. A compromised email account is often a possibility, especially if you have not taken precautions like enabling two-factor authentication, but a new wave of fraudulent spam has been going around and it uses supposed Dropbox verification as bait. In this type of phishing attack, the perpetrators put a legitimate Dropbox address in the message's sender field -- usually no-reply@dropbox.com, which is the real address Dropbox puts on messages when it is legitimately asking you to verify a new account.    However, the ''Verify my email'' button or link in the body of the message disguises the real destination the attacker wishes to send you. The button graphic or link is designed to send you to a phishing site or possibly download a virus; some observers have reported that the fake Dropbox links lead to ransomware that takes the user's hard drive hostage by encrypting its files.   You can see the real link under the ''Verify my email'' button in a few ways, like viewing the message in plain text (instead of the HTML commonly used to display links and graphics in email) in your desktop mail program. On a mobile device, press and hold the button or link -- but do not tap it as you normally would -- to reveal the hidden address. You can report the phishing messages by forwarding them to abuse@dropbox.com   Dropbox users have been frequent targets of scammers. The company's support site has a guide to recognizing malware and phishing attempts, as well as instructions for enabling two-step verification for stronger account protection.

Daily Report: A Global Attack Hits the Internet. Again.,"A cyberattack has hit at least 200,000 computers in 150 countries since Friday. More will be known about the extent of the incident as workers who might have missed it on Friday trickle into the office on Monday. But where there have not been major outbreaks might be most telling, at least about who takes computer security seriously.  The attack, to be specific, was a nasty form of ransomware, which hackers use to lock people out of their computers and demand payment. The malicious code relied on the victims opening a zip file emailed to them. From there, the program used a flaw in Microsoft operating system software to proliferate. Microsoft released a patch for that vulnerability in March, but as has been made clear, plenty of people, companies and government agencies around the world have not been keeping their software up to date.    That's a problem. Software companies and hackers are constantly playing a cat-and-mouse game. The hackers look for and often find flaws they can take advantage of, and the companies try to fix those flaws as quickly as they can. At least, that's how it's supposed to work.   True, software companies are often slow to respond to problems. But that does not appear to have been the case with this attack, since Microsoft released the patch for the vulnerability before it became widely known.   But there's little that a software company can do if customers don't take advantage of the fix. Not updating that software is an invitation for trouble.     "
"Evidence Links North Korea to Cyberattack, but China Stays Mute","HONG KONG -- North Korea tests nuclear weapons less than 100 miles from China's border. It launched a missile hours before a major speech by President Xi Jinping of China on Sunday, a move Chinese analysts called a diplomatic slap in the face. Its counterfeiting of Chinese and American currency costs China millions of dollars a year. North Korea's history of erratic behavior has embarrassed China in many ways. But through it all, China has remained stoic about its neighbor and ally.    As evidence mounts that North Korea may have links to a ransomware attack that destroyed more than 200,000 computers globally -- and hit 40,000 institutions in China -- China's response has been muted. Which raises the question: How far can North Korea go without getting disciplined by its more powerful neighbor?    China has been one of the biggest victims of the attack, which crippled computers at universities, major businesses and local governments, adding a potentially dangerous new element to a relationship that has increasingly tested Chinese leaders.   ''North Korea has been a constant threat in terms of missiles and nuclear weapons,'' said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University. ''All of a sudden, it poses a cyber threat.''   He added: ''This time if it's from North Korea, the malware was targeted indiscriminately against all computers. That's a big change. It harms and threatens China.''   Amid these tensions, Beijing is not eager to call attention to its deteriorating relations with its longtime ally. North Korea's missile launch took place hours before Mr. Xi addressed an international gathering in Beijing to promote China's ''One Belt, One Road'' project -- an enormous  infrastructure undertaking that is expected to build projects in Asia, Europe and Africa.   Even though the timing of the launch suggested it was a deliberate ploy to embarrass Mr. Xi at an inopportune time, it was not reported in the Chinese state media.   Regarding the ransomware attack, China analysts say Beijing will hesitate before directly casting blame on North Korea even if evidence, still inconclusive, directly ties the North to the attack. Beijing is more likely to single out other actors, particularly the United States, experts say.   The attack took advantage of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows software through a tool stolen from the United States' National Security Agency. That plays into broader Chinese concerns about its overreliance on American software.   China's influence over North Korea's hacking efforts has been significant. By some accounts, the idea to experiment with cyberattacks came to North Korea from China.   Initially, the North Korean government viewed the internet as a threat. But in the early 1990s, a group of computer experts returned from China with the idea of using the web to take secrets and attack government enemies, according to one defector.   Since then, North Korean hackers have attended schools in China and used it as a staging ground for attacks. As North Korea devoted more resources to those efforts -- eventually selecting child math prodigies for training and assembling an army of more than 6,000 -- it established a large outpost for its secretive hacking unit in China.   Security analysts say North Korean hackers operate out of hotels, restaurants and internet cafes in northeastern Chinese cities like Shenyang and Dandong, which are outposts for trade with North Korea. Though many still operate in China, North Korean hackers have increasingly moved further afield, to countries in Southeast Asia, where government surveillance and control is less strict.   The moves are also intended to protect cyberattack options in the event of a war on the Korean Peninsula. Security analysts say some attacks are also carried out from North Korea, but are limited by the fact that the country has only one main portal to the internet, through China's state telecom operator China Unicom.   Despite evidence suggesting a North Korean role in the ransomware attack, the most common reaction among experts and on Chinese social media was to blame the United States.   ''Many criticized the U.S. government, saying that it was responsible for this spread of ransomware. Obviously this accusation is reasonable,'' the editor in chief of state-run Global Times wrote in a prominent commentary on Monday.   ''Attacks always happen,'' said Chen Zhong, a professor in computer science at Peking University. ''What catches our eyes this time is that the attack used a tool that leaked from the N.S.A.,'' he said.   On the social media site Weibo, users almost uniformly blamed the United States for the attack.   ''Hell, if North Korea could do this they would have showed it off long ago,'' said one user. ''North Korea would have become a major power if they can pull this off,'' said another.   But Mr. Cheng of Renmin University said that if events more definitively linked the attack to North Korea, it was likely to pose a new test to China's increasingly rocky relationship with Pyongyang.   ''Since North Korea started its nuclear program in 2006, China-North Korea relations have gradually deteriorated, and are currently at an abnormal level. If we add another virus, the image of North Korea in the eyes of China will be even worse.''   China's news organizations, both state-run and private, reported on the hacking attacks, as well as the possible links to North Korea, hours after it occurred, but they did so in a controlled fashion that was confined to inside pages of newspapers, and played in modest ways on websites.   Still, several news portals wrote that cybersecurity firms like Kaspersky Lab had found initial evidence that pointed to North Korea. The news portal Sina pointed to previous attacks -- in Bangladesh, against Sony and the South Korean subway -- that may have originated from the North.   Should the evidence against North Korea mount, it would add to other indignities China has suffered at the hands of its neighbor.   Over the years, North Korea has flooded northeastern China with counterfeit $100 bills of American currency. It has also mass manufactured counterfeit Chinese renminbi, but China says little about the problem.   This year, South Korea accused the North of assassinating the half brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, at the international airport in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The relative, Kim Jong-nam, was considered a friend of China and he had lived in the Chinese-controlled territory of Macau, where he was protected by state security.   Chinese state-run media reported on the killing but refrained from associating Mr. Kim, the half brother, with China.   In 2013, an uncle of Kim Jong-un, who was the main financial conduit between China and the North, was executed by a firing squad that used antiaircraft guns, according to South Korea's National Intelligence Service.   South Korean intelligence said the killing of the uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was ordered by Mr. Kim as he was consolidating power over North Korea. His death meant that China lost its most important interlocutor with the North, and was an early signal from Mr. Kim that under his rule relations between China and North Korea would not be business as usual. But China withstood the insult without public recrimination.     "
The Real Threat to Election Integrity,"Russia's meddling in the 2016 election may not have altered the outcome of any races, but it showed that America's voting system is far more vulnerable to attack than most people realized. Whether the attackers are hostile nations like Russia (which could well try it again even though President Trump has raised the issue with President Vladimir Putin of Russia) or hostile groups like ISIS, the threat is very real. The question is this: Can the system be strengthened against cyberattacks in time for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential race? The answer, encouragingly, is that there are concrete steps state and local governments can take right now to improve the security and integrity of their elections. A new study by the Brennan Center for Justice identifies two critical pieces of election infrastructure -- aging voting machines and voter registration databases relying on outdated software -- that present appealing targets for hackers and yet can be shored up at a reasonable cost.     Last year, Russian hackers tried to break into voter databases in at least 39 states, aiming to alter or delete voter data, and also attempted to take over the computers of more than 100 local election officials before Election Day. There is no evidence that they infiltrated voting machines, but they have succeeded in doing so in other countries, and it's only a matter of time before they figure it out here. R. James Woolsey, the former C.I.A. director, wrote in an introduction to the Brennan Center report, ''I am confident the Russians will be back, and that they will take what they have learned last year to attempt to inflict even more damage in future elections.''   The report identifies three immediate steps states and localities can take to counter the threat.   First, conduct regular threat assessments of voter registration systems, and upgrade them if necessary. Forty-two states now use systems that are at least a decade old and rely on outdated software like Windows XP, for which Microsoft stopped providing security updates in 2014. This makes them especially susceptible to hacks, like the global ransomware attack in May that devastated Britain's national health service. The annual cost of performing these assessments throughout the country would be just $1 million to $5 million; the upgrades would cost more.   Second, replace old electronic voting machines that produce no paper trail. Fourteen states still use these machines, meaning there's no independent way to confirm the accuracy of one in five votes cast nationwide. New, auditable machines for everyone would cost between $130 million and $400 million, according to the report -- a pittance considering the stakes.   Third, audit the votes. This is generally done by comparing a random sample of paper records to voting machine totals and looking for discrepancies -- intentional or not. About half the states perform postelection audits, but many don't examine enough ballots to ensure that errors will be caught.   The good news in all of this is that voting in America is decentralized by design -- states and localities run elections in 8,000 jurisdictions and operate about 100,000 polling places -- making it very hard for any single attack to have a broad impact. The bad news is that voting systems, including the machinery, are never a high budget priority. As a result, necessary upgrades don't happen, leading to widely varying levels of security around the country.   Congress needs to allocate more money now to help states upgrade their equipment and computer systems, and to perform threat assessments. A key player is the federal Election Assistance Commission, which sets certification standards that almost every state relies on in buying new machines. The commission, established after the 2000 election debacle, has a tiny staff and a budget smaller than a rounding error. Its work has never been more urgently needed, and yet congressional Republicans are perpetually trying to kill it.   Meanwhile, the Trump administration's election-integrity commission is focused like a laser on the phantom fear of in-person voter fraud, a pet project of Republican politicians for more than a decade. That election security has become just another partisan battleground is sad but not surprising in these toxic political times.

Apple Removes Apps From China Store That Help Internet Users Evade Censorship,"HONG KONG -- China appears to have received help on Saturday from an unlikely source in its fight against tools that help users evade its Great Firewall of internet censorship: Apple. Software made by foreign companies to help users skirt the country's system of internet filters has vanished from Apple's app store on the mainland.    One company, ExpressVPN, posted a letter it had received from Apple saying that its app had been taken down ''because it includes content that is illegal in China.''    Another tweeted from its official account that its app had been removed.   A search on Saturday showed that a number of the most popular foreign virtual-private networks, also known as VPNs, which give users access to the unfiltered internet in China, were no longer accessible on the company's app store there.   ExpressVPN wrote in its blog that the removal was ''surprising and unfortunate.''   It added, ''We're disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China's censorship efforts.''   Sunday Yokubaitis, president of Golden Frog, a company that makes privacy and security software including VyprVPN, said its software, too, had been taken down from the app store. ''We gladly filed an amicus brief in support of Apple in their backdoor encryption battle with the F.B.I.,'' he said, ''so we are extremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure from China to remove VPN apps without citing any Chinese law or regulation that makes VPN illegal.''   He added, ''We view access to internet in China as a human rights issue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profits.''   In a statement, Apple noted that the Chinese government announced this year that all developers offering VPNs needed to obtain a government license. ''We have been required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,'' the company said. ''These apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.''   This is not the first time that Apple has removed apps at the request of the Chinese government, but it is a new reminder of how deeply beholden the tech giant has become to Beijing at a moment when the leadership has been pushing to tighten its control over the internet.   The removals signal a new push by China to control the internet. In the past, the Great Firewall has used technology to disrupt VPNs, and Beijing has shut down Chinese VPNs and even aimed a  huge cyberattack at a well-known foreign site hosting code that circumvented the filters.   But they also mark the first time China has successfully used its influence with a major foreign tech platform, like Apple, to push back against the software makers.   While internet crackdowns often peak every five years, ahead of a key Chinese Communist Party congress, this year's efforts cover fresh ground, a likely indication that stricter controls of things like VPNs will persist after the congress this autumn. Earlier this month, China also began a partial block of the Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp.   Greater China is Apple's largest market outside the United States. That has left the company more vulnerable than almost any other American technology firm to a Chinese campaign to wean itself off foreign technology and tighten control over foreign tech companies operating there.   In response, Apple has made a number of moves to ensure that it stays on Beijing's good side. Last year, the company complied with what it said was a request from the Chinese authorities to remove from its China app store news apps created by The New York Times.   This month, the company said it would open its first data center in China to comply with a new law that pushes foreign firms to store more of their data in China.   Apple has operated its app store in China for many years with only the occasional run-in with the government. The VPN crackdown and Beijing's move in December to target news sites indicates that China's internet regulators have taken a deeper interest, and are exerting more control, over what is available on Apple's China app store.

'Where Does Cloud Storage Really Reside? And Is It Secure?'; Ask The Times,"Ask The Times, a Times Insider feature, draws on New York Times expertise to answer questions about current events, science, sports, culture and whatever else is making headlines.  A reader asks: ""Where does cloud storage really reside? And is it secure?"" Quentin Hardy, The Times's deputy technology editor, considers the question.  _____ ""Cloud"" data is stored on hard drives (much the way data is usually stored). And yes, it's probably more secure than conventionally stored data. What makes cloud storage different? Instead of being stored directly on your own personal device (the hard drive on your laptop, for example, or your phone), cloud-based data is stored elsewhere - on servers owned by big companies, usually - and is made accessible to you via the internet. When people think of cloud computing, they often think of internet-connected public clouds run by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. (If you use Gmail, Dropbox or Microsoft's Office 365, you are using a cloud service.) There are also consumer clouds that, for example, hold your pictures and social media posts (think of Facebook or Twitter), or store your music and email (think of Apple or Google). Each of these companies has cloud computing systems - computer servers and storage devices, connected with computer networking equipment - that span the globe. (Facebook's systems can allow more than one billion people to interact with them.) Your data is in their computers, usually stored in a regional data center close to where you live. Individual companies can also have their own clouds, called private clouds, that employees and customers access, usually over the internet and on their own private networks. Storage aside, computing clouds can also process information differently; they have special software that enables workloads to be shared among different machines. Your Facebook photos, for example, don't have a permanent home on a specific chip, but may move among computers. That is a big deal. When workloads are shared, computers can run closer to full capacity, with several programs going at the same time. It's much more efficient than stand-alone computers running one job at a time. For the people running the computers, it doesn't really matter where the data or the programs are at any one moment: The stuff is running inside a ""cloud"" of computing capability. Ideally, if one machine fails, the operation moves over to another part of the system with little downtime. Nowadays, computing clouds are everywhere - which is one reason people worry about their security. We hear more and more often about hackers coming over the internet and looting the data of thousands of people. Most of those attacks hit traditional servers, though. None of the most catastrophic hacks have been on the big public clouds. The same way that your money is probably safer mixed up with other people's money in a bank vault than it is sitting alone in your dresser drawer, your data may actually be safer in the cloud: It's got more protection from bad guys. In the case of the big public clouds, the protection is the work of some of the world's best computer scientists, hired out of places like the National Security Agency and Stanford University to think hard about security, data encryption and the latest online fraud. And they're pretty good at keeping things safe online. At least, they have been so far. _____ Update, Jan. 24: Since this article was posted, Mr. Hardy has announced he is leaving The Times for a position at Google Cloud. _____ Have a question for Ask The Times?

"Howard Schmidt, Cybersecurity Adviser to Two Presidents, Dies at 67","Howard A. Schmidt, a computer crime expert who advised two presidents and drafted cybersecurity safeguards that were approved by Congress in 2015, died on Thursday at his home in Muskego, Wis. He was 67. The cause was brain cancer, his wife, Raemarie, said.    The legislation, which evolved from precautions he proposed several years earlier, enabled government and industry to share information about potential risks from attackers' codes and techniques, shielded companies from liability lawsuits for trading data and provided privacy protections for consumers.    By the time the congressional legislation was finally approved, though, critics complained that it had been diluted in response to corporate concerns and was already technologically anachronistic.   Recruited by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Mr. Schmidt returned to the White House under President Barack Obama.   He also oversaw the creation of the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, an online authentication program less vulnerable than ordinary passwords to hackers engaged in identity theft or in stealing secrets from private industry or government.   Mr. Schmidt won the trust of much of the business community, which was fending off a barrage of cyberattacks but which also feared government intrusion and a damper on innovation. At the same time, he suggested that the threat of full-scale cyberwarfare between governments was exaggerated and that any such conflict would be unwinnable.   With the United States portraying itself as a victim of cyberwarfare and much of the world viewing Washington as a perpetrator -- citing attacks on Iran's nuclear program as an example -- the White House proclaimed its first formal international cyberspace strategy during Mr. Schmidt's tenure.   That strategy mirrored the planned response to other security threats, in which the United States reserved the right to use all necessary diplomatic and military means to defend itself in the event of a hostile cyberincident. Meanwhile, Mr. Schmidt said, nations were already acting defensively.   ''Governments are starting to say, 'In order to best protect my country, I need to find vulnerabilities in other countries,''' he told The New York Times in 2013. ''The problem is that we all fundamentally become less secure.''   He said hackers exploited the fear that if one buyer failed to pay for secret information about a computer coding flaw, another would.   ''If someone comes to you with a bug that could affect millions of devices and says, 'You would be the only one to have this if you pay my fee,' there will always be someone inclined to pay it,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, dancing with the devil in cyberspace has been pretty common.''   For much of his 40-year career, Mr. Schmidt was in the forefront of information technology and computer security for the military, government agencies and private industry. Most recently he was a partner with Tom Ridge, the former Homeland Security secretary, in Ridge Schmidt Cyber, a security consultancy.   In the mid-1990s, while working for the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Mr. Schmidt was credited with helping to establish the federal government's first full-time computer forensic laboratory. He also served as chief security officer at Microsoft and chief information security officer at eBay.   Mr. Schmidt was the president's special adviser for cyberspace security in the Bush administration from late 2001 to 2003; he was also chairman of the president's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board.   The Obama administration recruited him in late 2009 to be its computer security adviser. He reported to the National Security Council.   Mr. Schmidt was the first president of the Information Security Forum, an industry and government coalition, and was chief security strategist for a partnership between the Department of Homeland Security and a cybersecurity program at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.   Howard Anthony Schmidt was born on Oct. 5, 1949, in Philadelphia to Anthony and Edith Schmidt. He served three tours in the Air Force in Vietnam from 1968 to 1974; was a police officer in Chandler, Ariz.; and worked for the F.B.I. at the National Drug Intelligence Center.   He graduated from the University of Phoenix in 1994 with a bachelor of science degree in business administration and earned a master's degree from that university.   In addition to his wife, the former Raemarie Lange, a forensic scientist, Mr. Schmidt is survived by his mother, Edith Curtis; his stepmother, Gloria Schmidt; his sons, Kyle, David, Andrew and Anthony; and eight grandchildren.

Cyberattack's Fallout Lingers In Companies' Bottom Lines,"As investigators continue to gather clues about the cyberattacks that hit computers around the world last week, some big companies and other organizations are still reckoning with the damage. At Mondelez International, a giant maker of snacks, thousands of servers and computers were rendered useless and production lines at some factories ground to a halt. The company said on Thursday that shipping and invoicing had been disrupted during the last four days of the most recent financial quarter, but that a ''critical majority'' of its systems were back up and running.    Hospitals across the United States have not been able to create electronic records for more than a week after the software maker Nuance Communications experienced significant problems with its computers. On Thursday, it was not clear when all of the company's systems would be working properly.    Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Lysol spray, lowered its sales forecasts on Thursday, citing disruptions to its supply chain. And at DLA Piper, a global law firm, employees said it might be a while before all systems returned to normal.   ''We are working with leading industry professionals to bring these back in a graduated way when we are satisfied that appropriate safeguards are in place to bring them online securely,'' John Lovallo, a DLA Piper spokesman, said in a statement.   Investigators were still sorting through the digital crumbs left behind after last week's crippling cyberattacks, known as NotPetya or Nyetya. Early signs pointed toward Russia, although it was unclear who in particular may have been responsible.   The attacks initially targeted government agencies, banks and companies in Ukraine. About 2,000 organizations there were hit on the eve of Constitution Day, a Ukrainian national holiday commemorating the country's first constitution after breaking away from the Soviet Union. And the initial infection point was accounting software used primarily by businesses and government agencies in Ukraine.   But collateral damage from the attack took down computers across the world, including major multinational companies that do business with Ukraine.   ''There's more to this story than what's been told,'' said Jaime Blasco, the vice president and chief scientist at AlienVault, a cybersecurity company that has been conducting a forensic investigation of the intrusion. ''Based on our analysis, this attack was really, really bad. Companies that weren't using best security practices were wiped out.''   At Mondelez, which makes products including Oreo cookies, Ritz Crackers and Trident gum, it took less than 20 minutes for hackers to destroy data on thousands of servers, and to cause the company's production facilities around the globe -- including a Cadbury chocolate factory in the far reaches of Tasmania -- to shut down.   As many as 30,000 Mondelez employees had their digital data wiped, many without adequate backups, according to two people briefed on the impact who were not allowed to discuss it publicly.   In a statement, Mondelez said it believed that it had contained the issue and that a ''critical majority of the affected systems are up and running again.'' The company said that it expected to incur one-time costs from the attack in its second and third quarters, but it reaffirmed its revenue outlook of ''at least 1 percent growth.''   That was not the case at Reckitt Benckiser, a British maker of consumer goods. On Thursday, the company was forced to trim its sales forecast for the year -- from 3 percent growth down to 2 percent -- as a result of NotPetya's impact on its manufacturing and distribution. Based on last year's revenue, that would amount to about $130 million.   NATO officials last week questioned whether the attack would cause the alliance's mutual defense clause, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, to be invoked. Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, told reporters that members agreed last year that such attacks could have that effect and pledged to help Ukraine bolster its cybersecurity defenses.   Officials in Britain took a harder line. Michael Fallon, the British defense secretary, said the country would consider retaliating against cyberattacks with military force.   In the United States, Thomas Bossert, the homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, said if the culprit was the Russian government or hackers working on its behalf, it was a foolish effort, because companies there -- most notably Rosneft, the government-owned oil company -- were also hit.   Like the WannaCry attacks that spread around the world in May, the attackers behind the episode last week used hacking tools that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft software. Some of the tools were stolen from the National Security Agency, and a group called the Shadow Brokers made them public in April.   Although the security agency has never acknowledged that its hacking tools were stolen -- let alone used in the two major attacks -- many security experts worry that there are other agency tools ready to be used by hackers. And they are calling on the N.S.A. to help the rest of the world defend against them.   Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, called on the agency to ''consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.''     "
Daily Report: When Ransomware Isn't After a Ransom,"We are two months into ''ransomware as a mainstream news topic,'' and we have quickly moved toward scrutiny of a new wrinkle in that kind of cyberattack: when ransomware is used as a smoke screen for something else.  On Tuesday, an attack that looked an awful lot like the WannaCry ransomware hacking in May started in Ukraine and spread throughout the world. But security researchers are beginning to infer that the attack was really about causing damage to computers. The money? Eh, not a big deal.    In fact, it would have been awfully hard for most victims of the attack to pay a ransom, since the lone email address connected to it was shut down by a German email provider.   So why bother? That's the question that intrigues security researchers. The most obvious answers are to cause trouble or send a political message. The attack that started in Ukraine appeared to have been timed to hit the day before a national holiday celebrating the country's first constitution after breaking away from the Soviet Union. It was not a leap for many to conclude the assault was launched by Russian hackers.   But there is another school of thinking: Certain information connected to the attack indicated it may have originated in Iran. Perhaps the attack was by Iranians trying hard to look like Russians while testing a new cyberattack before going after other targets -- a sort of beta test for cyberwarfare.   Or was it in fact Russian hackers, or someone else, pretending to be Iranian?   One aspect of the attacks that does not appear to be terribly complicated is where the tools for these hacks have come from -- the National Security Agency. The tools were among a collection of cyberweapons created by the N.S.A. and, unfortunately, stolen and posted online.   The N.S.A. has not acknowledged it had anything to do with these hacking tools. But plenty of people, including a few in Washington, are starting to ask what the agency plans to do to combat them.     "
Companies Join to Build Blockchain Software,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase and other corporate giants are joining forces to create a new kind of computing system based on the virtual currency network Ethereum. Some 30 companies are set to announce on Tuesday the formation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which will create a standard version of the Ethereum software that businesses around the world can use to track data and financial contracts.    The new organization, a nonprofit, is part of a broader movement to harness the technological concept known as the blockchain, which was introduced to the world by Bitcoin.    Blockchains offer a way for unrelated computers and companies to simultaneously collect and store information without relying on a central authority, similar to the way that Wikipedia is written and maintained by a group of writers and editors rather than a single author.   The technology is viewed as being harder to corrupt or hack because of its reliance on many people rather than a single authority.   Many big corporations have been looking for ways to use blockchain technology to keep track of information created by unrelated companies, like stock and bond trading transactions.   IBM has made a particularly big push into the blockchain business, and it has been leading a separate collaborative project, known as the Hyperledger Foundation.   The new Ethereum alliance has been described by some of its backers as a way to ensure that the IBM-led blockchain effort is not the only option for businesses looking to use the technology. Other companies like R3 and Chain have also been developing alternative blockchains.   ''We are pretty equally spending our time across the different chains,'' said Alex Batlin, the global head of blockchain at Bank of New York Mellon, which is joining the Ethereum alliance.   Ethereum was introduced in 2013 by a developer named Vitalik Buterin, then 19, who had previously worked on Bitcoin. Since its official release in 2015, the Ethereum network has been the target of hackers and theft.   Yet it has also won a large following among programmers who view it as a new and sophisticated way for groups of people and companies to initiate and track transactions and contracts of all sorts.   That has led some companies to bet that Ethereum will win the race to become the standard blockchain for future business operations.   ''In every industry that we come across, Ethereum is usually the first platform that people go to,'' said Marley Gray, the principal blockchain architect at Microsoft.   The creation of the Ethereum alliance shows a continuing commitment among big companies to making the technology work, in large part because it promises to create much more streamlined databases that require less back-office maintenance.   Accenture released a report last month arguing that blockchain technology could save the 10 largest banks $8 billion to $12 billion a year in infrastructure costs -- or 30 percent of their total costs in that area. Accenture is one of 11 companies on the governing board of the Ethereum alliance.   The current Ethereum network has an internal virtual currency known as Ether, the value of which has risen and fallen over the last two years. On Monday, a single Ether was worth around $15, and all the outstanding Ether were worth around $1.3 billion.   Ethereum, however, is much more than just a system for tracking currency. It also allows people to write what are known as smart contracts into the Ethereum blockchain. Two companies could, for instance, create a contract that would automatically send money to one of them if a particular news authority reported that the Chicago Cubs won the World Series or that ''La La Land'' won the Oscar for best picture. (As the latter example shows, what would happen if the authority was wrong is a more difficult question.)   Because of its capacity for smart contracts -- and other complicated computing capacities -- Ethereum is viewed as more agile and adaptable than Bitcoin.   As with Bitcoin, however, anyone can join the Ethereum network and see all the activity on the Ethereum blockchain.   The companies working on the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance want to create a private version of Ethereum that can be rolled out for specific purposes and be open only to certified participants. Banks could create one blockchain for themselves, and shipping companies could create another for their own purposes.   The purpose of the alliance is to create a standard, open-source version of Ethereum that can provide a foundation for any specific use case.   The private systems are not likely to require an Ether virtual currency, although the companies are hoping to create modules that will allow users to put in and take out individual elements of Ethereum as they choose.   Many companies have already been working to create their own versions of Ethereum for specific purposes.   JPMorgan, for instance, has created a version of Ethereum known as Quorum that the bank has been using in tests to move money between JPMorgan branches in different countries. Quorum will become a part of the new version of Ethereum being developed by the alliance.   Some of the companies working in the new alliance hope that the private Ethereum blockchains will, at some point, be able to connect to the public Ethereum blockchain, creating a standard for information storage and movement around the world.   ''Even if you create private networks, if you can anchor them to public networks, you get an extremely strong set of links together,'' Mr. Batlin, of BNY Mellon, said.   The work on Ethereum has continued despite an attack on an Ethereum project last year in which a hacker gained control of more than $50 million worth of Ether.   Mr. Batlin and others involved in the Ethereum Alliance said the way the Ethereum developers had handled that attack convinced them of the maturity of the technology.   Today, Ethereum has a larger community of volunteer developers, and more computers on its network than Bitcoin. And the members of the new alliance -- which include Banco Santander, BBVA, Credit Suisse, ING, Intel, Thomson Reuters and UBS -- say the real-world testing of Ethereum makes it stronger than the alternatives.   ''Ethereum has this massive advantage of having the public network that has been tested for two years,'' Mr. Gray, of Microsoft, said.     "
"Mexican Government Acquired Spyware, Leader Confirms","MEXICO CITY -- Even as Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto, acknowledged for the first time on Thursday that his government had purchased sophisticated software that has been used to spy on its fiercest critics, he also threatened to investigate those who ''have raised false accusations'' against his administration. That group would presumably include the victims themselves, including journalists and human rights lawyers, as well as the various media organizations that have reported on the spying.     At a press event, Mr. Peña Nieto acknowledged for the first time that his government had bought the sophisticated Israeli-made spyware, called Pegasus, but denied that it had ordered the surveillance. He promised an investigation into the misuse of the spyware. He then added: ''And I hope, under the law, it can be applied against those that have raised false accusations against the government.''   The immediate response, in particular of victims of the hacking attempts, was shock.   ''This not the expected behavior of the head of state of a young democracy,'' said Juan Pardinas, the head of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, who was the victim of a hacking attempt. ''This is the statement of an apprentice of Vladimir Putin.''   But shortly after Mr. Peña Nieto made the remarks, and following questions from The Times regarding the perceived threat, the president's spokesman, Eduardo Sánchez, said in an interview: ''In no way was the president attempting to threaten either The New York Times or any of these groups. The president misspoke.''   An article in The Times and an analysis by Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto Munk School of Global Affairs concluded that Pegasus had been deployed to infiltrate the phones of journalists and government critics and, in some cases, their relatives.   At a press conference in Guadalajara on Thursday night, Mr. Peña Nieto elaborated on his earlier comments. ''What I said, the scope of the instruction I gave, was precisely to follow up on the criminal complaints that some activists have filed regarding this supposed spying,'' he said.   Though there is no proof that the government was behind the hacking attacks, activists have pointed to several pieces of circumstantial evidence that point to state surveillance.   Pegasus, which was created by an Israeli manufacturer called the NSO Group, is only sold to governments, and only on the condition that it be used against terrorists and criminals. The company says that the software cannot be transferred or used by anyone other than the purchaser.   According to contracts obtained by The Times, the Mexican government purchased at least $80 million worth of the software across various security agencies.   And yet between 2015 and 2016, some of the most outspoken critics of Mr. Peña Nieto's administration were targeted by the spyware. The victims include lawyers who represent the parents of 43 students who vanished in 2014 and the journalist who reported that the president's wife received a special deal on the purchase of a mansion from a government contractor close to the president.   Though the government responded to questions presented three weeks before publication of The Times's article, Thursday marked the first time that it acknowledged having purchased the spyware. But the president vehemently denied that the software had been misused by anyone in his administration.   ''This government categorically rejects any sort of intervention in the private lives of any citizen,'' he said. ''All the equipment, technology that this government effectively has and has purchased, is to maintain the internal security of the nation, to fight organized crime, to generate security for all Mexicans.''

Kaspersky Lab Software Is Ordered Wiped From Government Computers,"WASHINGTON -- The federal government moved on Wednesday to wipe from its computer systems any software made by a prominent Russian cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, that is being investigated by the F.B.I. for possible links to Russian security services. The concerns surrounding Kaspersky, whose software is sold throughout the United States, are longstanding. The F.B.I., aided by American spies, has for years been trying to determine whether Kaspersky's senior executives are working with Russian military and intelligence, according to current and former American officials. The F.B.I. has also been investigating whether Kaspersky software, including its well-regarded antivirus programs, contain back doors that could allow Russian intelligence access into computers on which it is running. The company denies the allegations.     The officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiries are classified, would not provide details of the information they have collected on Kaspersky. But on Wednesday, Elaine C. Duke, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, ordered federal agencies to develop plans to remove Kaspersky software from government systems in the next 90 days.   Wednesday's announcement is the latest instance of the apparent disconnect between the Trump White House, which has often downplayed the threat of Russian interference to the country's infrastructure, and front-line American law enforcement and intelligence officials, who are engaged in a perpetual shadow war against Moscow-directed operatives.   Kaspersky's business in the United States now appears to be the latest casualty in those spy wars. Best Buy, the electronics giant, announced last week that it was pulling Kaspersky Lab's cybersecurity products from its shelves and website, and the Senate is voting this week on a defense-spending bill that would ban Kaspersky Lab products from being used by American government agencies, effectively codifying Wednesday's directive into law.   Kaspersky is considered one of the foremost cybersecurity research firms in the world, and has considerable expertise in designing antivirus software and tools to uncover spyware used by Western intelligence services. The company was founded by Eugene V. Kaspersky, who attended a high school that trained Russian spies, and later wrote software for the Soviet Army before going on to found Kaspersky Lab in 1997. He has insisted that neither he nor his company have active ties to the Russian military or intelligence services.   Yet despite its prominence in the cybersecurity world, its origins in Russia have for years fueled suspicions about its possible ties to Russia's intelligence agencies. Federal officials have warned private companies to avoid Kaspersky software, and earlier this year the firm was removed from two lists of approved vendors used by government agencies to purchase technology.   At a Senate hearing in May, a number of senior American security officials, including the chiefs of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., were even more blunt when asked if they would be comfortable with Kaspersky software running on their agencies' systems: ''No,'' they said.   Still, Kaspersky's software is believed to be used in many federal agencies, especially its antivirus products, though there is no reliable estimate of its ubiquity -- government computer systems tend be a jumbled-together collection of often-aging software and hardware, and no central authority keeps track of who uses what.   Kaspersky's software is also widely used by state governments and ordinary Americans. The company says it has more than 400 million users around the world. It also has a robust business analyzing and investigating cyberthreats.   ''The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security,'' Ms. Duke said in a statement.   Kaspersky said it was disappointed with Homeland Security's decision and denied any ties to the Russian government.

Tech Roundup: Preventing Hacking From Happening to You,"The documents revealed by WikiLeaks that indicate the Central Intelligence Agency has been sitting on a collection of spy-friendly software vulnerabilities are certainly intriguing. More worrisome, perhaps, is the question of who else knows about these security weaknesses.  Hackings are rarely discovered in a secure facility accessed only by spooks. They are more often than not found in the online bazaar of hackers and cyberweapons dealers trading security information for fun and profit. And the C.I.A. is hardly the only intelligence agency looking to acquire that information.    It is safe to say that intelligence and law enforcement authorities from most countries -- not to mention a wide array of hackers -- are on the lookout for ways to break into smartphones and other security devices.   So what should you do about it? The Times's Brian X. Chen offers a few tips: First, update your software if you are using an iPhone or an Android phone. Most of the breaches described in the documents appeared to target older software. On your personal computers, also make sure you have the latest operating system and antivirus software. You should also update the firmware in your router.   The bad news? If hackers can really turn Samsung TVs into monitoring devices, there is no easy solution. Samsung says it is looking into the issue.   More tech news:   Uber says it will stop employees from using a program called Greyball to thwart regulators. In the wake of a New York Times article about the tool, which appeared to allow drivers to avoid officers in Oregon, the company said it was conducting a review of how it is used.   The White House has been echoing the tech world: ''Move fast and break things.'' Defying political norms, President Trump has embraced the philosophy of disruption and management styles that have powered successful start-ups.   Which smart home devices are best for you?

Protecting Your Smart Devices,"Q. How safe is it to give smart gadgets the password to my Wi-Fi network? Should I be worried and what can I do? A. As researchers have  found vulnerabilities in internet-connected light bulbs, it is wise to be wary when connecting smart device to your home network. Wirelessly linked gadgets like security cameras, thermostats and baby monitors (usually called the Internet of Things) have been targets for intruders looking to invade or disrupt. A major cyberattack powered by compromised devices brought online traffic to a halt last fall, for example. A detailed post on the Heimdal Security blog can give you an idea of how intruders can abuse smart devices.     In many cases, weak security -- on the network or the devices themselves -- has left holes for hackers to climb through, but you can shore up your home defenses in a number of ways. For starters, make sure your home network router is using a strong password and not the default one it came with out of the box. Your router's manufacturer should have instructions for changing the password.   You should also change any default passwords on your smart devices -- and use different passwords for each one. Be sure to install any available firmware updates or security patches from the company that made the product.   The Department of Homeland Security recommends disabling the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) feature on the router and any devices as well. UPnP was intended to make connecting devices to a network easier, but it can also let malware through your firewall and onto your network. Your router and device manufacturer should also have instructions for turning off UPnP.   Several commercial security companies, including Sophos and Norton, suggest creating a separate network just for your smart devices to keep them isolated from the computers on your main network. Some routers allow you to create a second network for untrusted users, so check the manual for your model to see if this feature is included.   Networking hardware with enhanced security measures to protect connected devices are also starting to emerge as new defense systems for home users; the Norton Core and F-Secure's Sense router are two such products on the way.

"From Manafort to Russia, Intrigue Finds a Warm Home in Ukraine","Andrew Higgins reported from Poltava, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow. POLTAVA, Ukraine -- After four years of investigation by the German police, the F.B.I. and other crime-fighting agencies around the world, heavily armed security officers stormed an apartment in the central Ukrainian town of Poltava. After a brief exchange of gunfire, they captured their prey: the man suspected of leading a cybercrime gang accused of stealing more than $100 million. The arrest of Gennadi Kapkanov, 33, a Russian-born Ukrainian hacker, and the takedown of Avalanche, a vast network of computers he and his confederates were accused of hijacking through malware and turning into a global criminal enterprise, won a rare round of applause for Ukraine from its frequently dispirited Western backers.    By the following day, however, Mr. Kapkanov had disappeared.    A judge in a district court in Poltava turned down a prosecution request that he be held in preventive custody for 40 days, and ordered him set free. Mr. Kapkanov has not been seen since.   Whether Mr. Kapkanov's flight was the result of corruption, incompetence or a mix of the two has not been clearly established. The prosecutor general in Kiev, Ukraine's capital, threatened to fire the local prosecutor but backed off when it became clear that the case had been handled by one of his own deputies.   The Poltava debacle helps explain why Ukraine, a land of so much promise thanks to its educated population, fertile farmland and vibrant civil society, has a tendency instead to generate so many headline-grabbing scandals.   Over the past year, Ukraine has been battered by revelations: off-the-books payments to President Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort; the creation in Ukraine of malware used in hacking attacks by Russia during the 2016 American presidential election; and speculation that its Soviet-era missile technology may have been smuggled to North Korea.   The sagas are unrelated in their substance and timing. Mr. Manafort's activities in Ukraine predate Ukraine's 2014 revolution, while the others follow it. But they all flow in part from the same dysfunctions of a weak state gnawed by corruption and thrown off balance by constant Russian pressure, and the open vistas of opportunity for skulduggery that these have offered.   ''Why is there so much noise around Ukraine? Because Ukraine is the epicenter of the confrontation between the Western democratic world and authoritarian, totalitarian states,'' Oleksandr Turchynov, the head of Ukraine's national security and defense council, said in an interview. He denounced reports of Ukraine providing missiles to North Korea as Russian disinformation aimed at undermining Western support.   But while Russia has worked steadily since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union to weaken Ukraine and keep it within Moscow's orbit of influence -- first through economic pressure and political meddling and then military aggression -- Ukraine has also enfeebled itself.   ''The thread that ties strange things together in Ukraine is nearly always corruption,'' said Serhiy A. Leshchenko, an opposition member of the Ukrainian Parliament and vociferous critic of President Petro O. Poroshenko.   Mr. Poroshenko, he conceded, is better than his predecessor, the kleptocratic, pro-Russian leader -- and former Manafort client -- Viktor F. Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in February 2014 after months of street protests in Kiev. ''But that is only because he is weaker, and society is much stronger,'' Mr. Leshchenko said.   Mr. Poroshenko, unlike his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir V. Putin, also has to contend with a lively free press that delights in probing and exposing government stumbles and the maneuvers of self-dealing insiders.   And unlike the three Baltic States, which enjoyed brief periods of independence between the First and Second World Wars, Ukraine has only an acute awareness of centuries of subjugation by outside powers, among them Poland, Austria and Russia, that left its people inherently wary of authority.   ''What is Ukraine's national idea? It is resistance to authority,'' said Taras Chornovil, a former adviser to Mr. Yanukovych.   Ukraine's painful history as a put-upon appendage has left it ill-equipped to curb unruly habits at odds with the rule-based, scandal-shy order of the European Union, which it aspires to join.   ''Its attempts to stay democratic while building a nation are often messy, its oligarchs all powerful and, given the virtual absence of state control over media and oligarchic competition, post-Soviet corruption is out in the open,'' said Serhii Plokhii, a Harvard professor and the author of a history of Ukraine.   Ukraine's domestic intelligence service, or S.B.U., its powers of surveillance greatly enhanced by monitoring equipment provided by the United States after Mr. Yanukovych decamped to Russia, has added its own highly selective and distorted form of transparency by leaking information about alleged wrongdoing, often for political or financial gain.   Controlled by Mr. Poroshenko, the S.B.U. has become a tool in domestic political and business battles, with anti-corruption activists accusing it of working to undermine, not help, their cause.   While still politically influenced, Ukrainian law enforcement is no longer the swamp of incompetence and corruption it once was. It has been able to monitor Mr. Manafort's former business associates and turn up evidence of Russian hacking in the 2016 United States election, in part owing to American technical support.   The Central Intelligence Agency tore out a Russian-provided cellphone surveillance system, and put in American-supplied computers, said Viktoria Gorbuz, a former head of a liaison office at the S.B.U. that worked with foreign governments.   Ms. Gorbuz's department translated telephone intercepts from the new system and forwarded them to the Americans. ''This team would translate and immediately, 24 hours a day, be in full cooperation with our American colleagues,'' she said.   It is unclear whether any phone intercepts relevant to the election meddling investigation have gone to the American authorities. But a Ukrainian law enforcement official has given journalists partial phone records of former associates of Mr. Manafort.   Dismantling Russian spy gear, however, proved far easier than purging Russian power, which has shadowed Ukraine constantly since it declared independence in 1991 but became far more aggressive in recent years.   Since March 2014 Ukraine has lost Crimea to Russian annexation and large chunks of its industrial heartland in the east to rebels backed by fighters and weapons from Russia. It has also been used as a testing ground by Moscow for disinformation and hacking techniques later deployed during presidential election campaigns in the United States and France.   Ukrainian officials invariably cite Russian meddling to explain why anti-corruption and other steps demanded by the West have often faltered. While Russia is a convenient excuse, it is also a very real menace.   In Poltava, the center of town is dominated by a czarist-era monument to Russia's victory over Sweden in a 1709 battle that sealed Russia's rise as the region's pre-eminent power and ended Ukrainians' early aspirations for their own state.   Now draped in Ukrainian flags, the monument nonetheless stands as a powerful reminder of Russia's looming presence in a country that has struggled to create a functioning independent state on the fragile foundations left by more than 70 years of communism and centuries of subjugation by Russian czars.   Igor Gavrilenko, a lecturer in Ukrainian history at the Poltava National Technical University, said the release of Mr. Kapkanov, the man accused of being a cybercrime kingpin, was typical of the dysfunction that has plagued Ukraine.   ''The whole situation is absurd, but nothing in my country really surprises me anymore,'' he said, sitting in a park near the Poltava battle monument. ''Ukraine is a country where anything is possible if you have money.''   It was to Ukraine that Mr. Manafort looked for new business horizons after doing work for despots in Africa and Asia. Setting up shop in Kiev, he became entangled in a murky constellation of Russian and Ukrainian business tycoons and politicians, notably Mr. Yanukovych, the president ousted in 2014.   Mr. Chornovil, who worked as Mr. Yanukovych's campaign manager in 2004, remembers Mr. Manafort as ''arrogant and full of self-confidence,'' a showman who liked to organize big, splashy events that required lavish spending.   A secret ledger recording payments to Mr. Manafort and others, he said, was part of a crude effort to keep track of all the money sloshing through Mr. Yanukovych's administration.   ''Everyone was stealing, and the party wanted a record of who got what,'' Mr. Chornovil. ''They never imagined that they might lose power one day and the accounts would come to light.''   Mr. Manafort, he said, often clashed with members of the president's entourage but ''had a colossal influence on Yanukovych for some reason.''   He added: ''He was not here out of any ideology but to make money. He was here exclusively for the money.''   The end of Mr. Yanukovych's rule in 2014 upended Mr. Manafort's business in Kiev and brought in Mr. Poroshenko on a wave of reformist fervor.   Left in place, however, was what has for years been Ukraine's strength as a pluralistic society and also its fundamental flaw: a fragile state that is too fragmented by competing economic and regional interests to impose either Russian-style authoritarianism or European-style rule of law.   ''There was never a strong state on this land. Medieval feudal mosaics, fragile kingdoms and early-modern Cossack republics had nothing in common with European absolutism or Russian authoritarianism,'' said Valerii Pekar, a lecturer at the Kiev-Mohyla Business School, in a recent article. ''This is a country of balance, not of leadership. Nobody can rule Ukraine like a king.''   The West, fed up with the dysfunction, has been pushing Mr. Poroshenko with only partial success to tip the balance away from the corruption-tainted oligarchs and Russian proxies who often held sway under Mr. Yanukovych.   He did establish an independent anti-corruption agency and introduce a mandatory declaration of assets for officials and members of Parliament. But he has so far stalled on setting up a tribunal outside the existing court system to try corruption cases.   Larissa Kulishova, the judge in Poltava who let the hacker go, denied that she had erred. In a brief interview, the judge said she had made her ruling ''in full accordance with Ukrainian and European law.'' She disputed an appeals court judgment issued after the hacker had fled that overturned her decision and said she had been wrong: ''I don't think I made a mistake.''   Larissa Golnyk, a judge in the same courthouse, said she could not speculate on what prompted her fellow judge to free Mr. Kapkanov but expressed dismay at the decision.   Ms. Golnyk has bitter experience of the pressures put on judges. Equipped with a secret camera by anti-corruption investigators, she filmed a representative of Poltava's mayor offering her a $5,000 bribe to close a case. Posted online, the video produced a public uproar but no action against the mayor or his emissary.   ''Every time something clearly wrong happens I ask, 'How can this be happening?''' Ms. Golnyk said. ''I am always told, 'Come on, you must be used to such things by now.'''     "
The Internet of Things Is Coming for Us,"William Neuman, the former Andes region bureau chief for The Times, covers City Hall in New York. Luis Jaime Castillo Butters is a professor of archaeology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. The Moche people lived on Peru's north coast long before the Spanish conquest of the Americas. They grew corn and squash, built monumental adobe temples and were master craftsmen in gold and ceramics. They never had the chance to sell their wares on Etsy, and yet they anticipated some of our most modern anxieties.    Like us, they saw themselves living in a vulnerable world where the technology created to make their lives better was just as likely to turn against them. While we worry about our baby monitors and home routers being hijacked by malicious hackers, they perceived a world in which everyday objects like jugs and clothes might come to life with ominous consequences.    Moche artists painted scenes of this happening on ceramic vessels and on the walls of their temples. They appear whimsical to us today -- items of clothing, weaving implements, weapons, all with arms and legs, hands and feet, some with heads and faces, on parade or engaged in battle -- but for the Moche they may have represented a deep-seated uncertainty and fear about the ultimate fate of the human-created world.   In some scenes, the animated objects are docile. In one, bowls piled with food and jugs have grown legs and walk toward human figures participating in a ceremony; some helpful jugs even bend over to pour liquid into vessels.   But other paintings show a world turned upside down, where the objects have taken charge: They fight and defeat human warriors and parade naked human captives.   In an excavation in 1991 near the town of San José de Moro, archaeologists, including one of the authors of this piece, Luis Jaime Castillo Butters, discovered the lavish tomb of a Moche priestess. Her coffin had been anthropomorphized, with a mask representing the priestess' face on top and with arms and legs fashioned from copper on the sides.   Inherent in the idea that objects have life is the more subversive concept that they also have desires; feel hate and love; seek revenge; and have the capacity to act on their own.   In the modern world, most of the objects that surround us are a result of an impersonal process of production -- they come from factories, we buy them in stores or online. For the Moche, objects were not produced -- they were created, imbuing them with the ambiguity and mystery with which life is given to animated beings.   Such objects could be either beneficial or dangerous, depending on whether they decided to serve their creators or turn against them, either of their own volition or through the black arts of others.   We now live in a world where objects once again have life. We can talk to them and they can answer back, as is the case with Alexa and Siri and their digital kin. With their help we can control and organize the world around us: We can make sure our homes are safe, turn lights and appliances on or off, summon a taxi or order food from a restaurant. Little by little we are transferring to these technologies the tasks that we used to do ourselves, and at the same time, we are giving them control over our surroundings.   The internet of things is made up of billions of everyday devices connected for convenience to the web. Last fall, hackers attacked this network, commandeering as many as 100,000 of these devices by using malicious software that guessed at their simple, factory-set passwords, and then ordering them to send volleys of nuisance messages to the computers of a company called Dyn, which functions as a sort of switchboard for the internet. That was enough to cripple many major websites, including Twitter and Netflix. We have given life to these things, but now we know that they do not obey only us.   There are alternative interpretations of the Moche ceramic paintings, and some researchers do not see a sinister component. But the paintings have an echo in a myth collected in central Peru in the early 17th century. In the myth, the sun dies, the world is plunged into darkness and household objects and domesticated animals revolt: Mortars and grinding stones eat people, and llamas drive humans.   Andean people before the conquest created a philosophical and spiritual system built around the concepts of duality and transformation -- light versus darkness, order versus chaos.   The modern world is full of such opportunities for chaos, often created by humans and the increasing sophistication and technology-centeredness of modern life. A solar flare has the potential to disrupt electrical networks. A tsunami can flood a nuclear reactor. The digitalization of stock markets leads to flash crashes. Russian hackers stealing Democratic Party emails seek to influence an American presidential election.   Order gives way to chaos. The internet of things turns on its makers.   The Moche culture collapsed around A.D. 850. The reasons are not clear, but the collapse was most likely a result of the Moche's inability to cope with a hostile and perhaps changing environment, including the failure of their technology, knowledge and institutions to help them overcome those challenges. We can be certain that the technology they created did not rebel against them. But neither did it save them when they needed it the most.

Tech Roundup: A Senate Vote Is Not the Final Word on Internet Privacy,"Those rules meant to protect the privacy of your internet activity that you may have heard about? Never mind. In a 50-48 vote mostly along party lines on Thursday, the Senate moved to strip consumer privacy rules that had just been created in October. Next week, the House is expected to go along with the Senate measure, and the rule changes would then head to President Trump for his signature.     The move by the Senate means telecommunications carriers can ''continue tracking and sharing people's browsing and app activity without asking their permission,'' Cecilia Kang writes. ''An individual's data collected by these companies also does not need to be secured with 'reasonable measures' against hackers.''   The rules were supposed to go into effect at the end of this year.   Washington's zeal for privacy protection may have cooled, but that doesn't mean you don't have other means to keep what you do out of other people's hands.   Various types of software can help protect internet traffic from prying eyes. A number of browsers, for example, have ''stealth'' settings that make it difficult to track a web surfer's activities.   Other software can make it difficult to pinpoint where that traffic is coming from. Perhaps the best known is Tor. Created and managed by a nonprofit digital privacy group called the Tor Project, it is used by a wide range of people, from activists trying to avoid government censorship or surveillance to people conducting illicit business on the so-called dark web.   There are also a number of apps that can encrypt internet messages. Signal, free software offered by a company called Open Whisper Systems, may be the best known of them.   Another example among many free software packages designed to prevent eavesdropping and hide a user's internet address is the Hotspot Shield software offered by AnchorFree, a company based in Mountain View, Calif.   Hotspot Shield gained popularity among activists during the Arab Spring in 2011 and since then has been widely used amid unrest in Turkey, Brazil and -- since the presidential election in November -- the United States. Well over 500 million copies of the software have been downloaded around the world, the company says.   More tech news:   The C.I.A. developed tools to spy on Mac computers by injecting software into the chips that control the computers' fundamental operations, according to t classified government documents published on Thursday by WikiLeaks.   Hours after the terrorist attack in London, online sleuths thought they had identified the assailant. In Twitter posts, Facebook messages and a television news program, people pointed to Abu Izzadeen, a radical British cleric who was imprisoned last year. But they were wrong.     "
"10 Concerts, One's a Lie? Be Cautious, Experts Say","It's all fun and games until someone's password security question gets hacked. A meme making the rounds on Facebook asks users to list 10 concerts -- nine they've attended and a fabricated one -- and invites others to identify the fake one.    But the post -- ''10 Concerts I've Been To, One is a Lie'' -- might also be an invitation to a midlevel threat to your online privacy and security, experts said.    The meme, which surged in popularity this week, is the kind of frivolous distraction that makes up social media interactions, similar to other viral memes, such as the Ice Bucket Challenge.   Privacy experts cautioned it could reveal too much about a person's background and preferences and sounds like a security question -- name the first concert you attended -- that you might be asked on a banking, brokerage or similar website to verify your identity.   Michael Kaiser, executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance, said on Friday that the meme posed a moderate security risk, adding that not every website relied on a security question about a person's first concert.   He said the greater danger is what such a list might broadly reveal through social engineering. It could telegraph information about a user's age, musical tastes and even religious affiliation -- all of which would be desirable to marketers hoping to target ads.   He said it is similar to users who take quizzes on Facebook. The answers can reveal specifics about a person's upbringing, culture or other identifying details. ''You are expressing things about you, maybe in more subtle ways than you might think,'' he said.   Mark Testoni, a national security and privacy expert who is chief executive of SAP National Security Services, said in an email that he recommended exercising ''vigilance bordering on a little paranoia'' in online posts.   ''We need to understand how we interact can disclose not only specific details but patterns of behavior and often our location, among other things,'' he wrote.   Alec Muffett, a software engineer and security researcher, wrote in an email that he is sympathetic to polls like the concert question. ''They are cute, a little bit fun, you learn new things about your friends, and sometimes you get a surprise or two,'' he wrote.   ''There are certainly also polls that are geared towards collecting information which could be used to fraudulently 'recover' an account,'' he added.   He said companies, governments and other groups rely on so-called authenticators, such as ''What is your mother's maiden name?'' Such answers are not truly authenticators, but are facts.   ''The usual aphorism is: 'Your password should be secret, but 'secrets' make really bad passwords' -- especially when they are just discoverable or guessable facts,'' Mr. Muffett wrote.   Mr. Kaiser agreed. In cases where the answer to a security question is easily obtained -- what high school did you attend? -- it's best to make up an answer, even if it's not as easy to recall.   He said his advice about online quizzes and memes was not meant to be a killjoy, though he encouraged social media users to consider the consequences of what they share.   ''People always have to have their eyes wide open when they're on the internet,'' he said. ''It's the way of the world.''     "
Former Top Justice Dept. Lawyer to Join Morrison & Foerster,"John P. Carlin, who was the Justice Department's top national security lawyer, has moved to the law firm Morrison & Foerster to lead its global risk and crisis management practice, the firm announced on Tuesday.  The former assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's National Security Division, Mr. Carlin led the group that helped protect against international and domestic terrorism, espionage, cyberthreats and other dangers to national security.    His prior experience includes serving as chief of staff and senior counsel to Robert S. Mueller III, a former director of the F.B.I. Mr. Carlin was later named to the Justice Department post, where he headed an investigation into the breach of Sony Entertainment's computer system, as well as other attacks on public and private sector email systems. As a partner at Morrison & Foerster, Mr. Carlin will use his expertise to help expand its practices in cybersecurity, data privacy, national security, government enforcement and white-collar defense.   ''I look forward to building on the existing expertise across multiple practices to deliver what clients want: strategies to manage and mitigate risk before a crisis occurs and the experience to navigate complex matters throughout a business when the worst happens and the company is on the line,'' Mr. Carlin said.   Larren M. Nashelsky, chairman of Morrison & Foerster, which is ranked No. 28 among the top 200 firms in the country by The American Lawyer, said Mr. Carlin's experience equipped him to focus ''on advising companies responding to global and national security threats.''   The firm, which is based in San Francisco, has hired experienced federal government lawyers to form a ''one-stop shop for companies seeking legal counsel on the potentially catastrophic risks faced by companies cutting across all industry sectors, including technology and transportation,'' said David F. McDowell, co-chairman of the firm's litigation department.     "
Spain Arrests Russian Said to Be Kingpin of Spamming,"MOSCOW -- He refused to meet business associates in person and never talked on the phone, preferring instead to communicate via encrypted messaging services. But the elaborate precautions taken by the Russian computer spam kingpin known as Peter Severa appear to have failed him. Acting on an F.B.I. request, the police in Spain arrested a man this weekend named Peter Levashov, according to Russian news media reports and Reuters, citing a Russian Embassy spokesman in Madrid. Western cybersecurity researchers have identified Mr. Levashov as Peter Severa, though some doubt he is the same person.     The initial reports in Russian news media of Mr. Levashov's arrest did not say if he was suspected by United States intelligence agencies of being involved in attempts by Russian government hackers to meddle in the 2016 American presidential election. The American intelligence agencies have said Russian hackers broke into the servers of the Democratic National Committee and the email of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman and released documents in an effort to sway the election toward Donald J. Trump.   But computer researchers who have linked the long-running computer spam business of the man known as Peter Severa to malware used in 2012 to influence a domestic election in Russia say his arrest could give other investigations important information.   Mr. Levashov was arrested in Barcelona, where he had been vacationing with his family, according to a report on RT, a state-owned Russian television network. The report cited his wife, who said the Spanish police had detained Mr. Levashov at the request of the American authorities.   A Justice Department spokesman, Peter Carr, said Sunday that ''the U.S. case remains under seal, so we have no information to provide at this time.''   If law enforcement officials confirm Mr. Levashov is Peter Severa, his arrest could mark a significant break in prosecuting Russian spam and computer crime.   The Russian corner of the internet has a reputation as a repository of pornography and pirated content, and as a birthplace for global fraud schemes.   Spamhaus, a group that tracks spammers, has for years listed Peter Severa as among the top 10 perpetrators in the world, and has identified him as Mr. Levashov.   Brian Krebs, an American cybersecurity researcher, wrote in 2012 that Peter Severa could be another Russian man, Viktor Ivashov, and not Mr. Levashov.   The Russian name Peter Severa, which translates roughly as Peter of the North, could refer to Mr. Levashov's hometown, St. Petersburg, or Peter North, an actor in pornographic films, in a reference to the online pornography businesses. Along with sending spam advertising, according to Spamhaus, Peter Severa worked with Alan Ralsky, an American spam operator who was convicted in the United States of fraud.   The Russian cybersecurity researchers Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan wrote in 2012 that participants in online Russian hacker forums were discussing whether Peter Severa had been recruited by the F.S.B., the successor to the K.G.B. The researchers said Peter Severa had been on closed chat sites trying to recruit underground hackers for a later abandoned effort by the Russian security services to crash Islamic extremist websites.   Peter Severa's spam operation ran a sophisticated, evolving family of computer viruses called Waledac and later Kelihos, developed in part by a former military engineer also living in St. Petersburg named Andrei N. Sabelnikov, according to a 2012 American court filing by Microsoft.   The court filing and related forensic work on the Kelihos virus illustrated how criminal hacker tools are repurposed for political ends. The filing identified Mr. Sabelnikov as the designer of the Kelihos virus.   ''People in this business don't care where their money comes from,'' Mr. Sabelnikov said last December in a telephone interview about the operators of the Kelihos virus, adding that he did not know who was behind it. He said code he had written for an antivirus company had been used without his knowledge. Mr. Sabelnikov settled with Microsoft and now lives in Bali.   The Kelihos virus, which had been devised to spread spam, was used during the Russian election in 2012 to send political messages to email accounts on computers with Russian I.P. addresses. The emails linked to fake news stories saying that Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the businessman running for president against Vladimir V. Putin, had come out as gay.     "
Tech Roundup: The Vast Criminal Enterprise Lurking Behind Spam Emails,"Ever wonder how spam emails find their way into your inbox? It turns out they may be part of a possible criminal enterprise that has its roots in Russia.    At least that is what federal officials claimed on Monday, when they unsealed an indictment against Peter Levashov, a Russian who is suspected of being a mastermind behind an enormous spam email operation that officials said also committed stock fraud and drained people's bank accounts, writes Michael Schwirtz, a reporter for The New York Times.    Mr. Levashov, who apparently used the pseudonym Peter Severa, has been wanted by American authorities for more than a decade. He controlled a giant network of virus-infected computers, which he rented out to cybercriminals and which he also used to send spam emails for items such as erectile dysfunction drugs. The subject lines of those emails sometimes read ''No amorous failure risk.''   Federal officials had tried in the past to capture Mr. Levashov, but he appeared to be protected by the Russian government -- at least for a time. Then last week, the Russian traveled to Barcelona, Spain, with family, where the jig was finally up. On Friday, Mr. Levashov was arrested by the Spanish police in a hotel room in Barcelona, while the F.B.I. and some cybersecurity companies shut down his network of computers.   Mr. Levashov now awaits extradition to the United States.   More Tech News:    Toshiba casts doubt on its ability to stay in business.

"Two Russians, One Hacker And a Riddle For the U.S.","MOSCOW -- In December, Russia arrested two of its most senior cybersecurity officials on treason charges, prompting speculation that the pair might have tipped off the American authorities about Russian hacking during the 2016 election campaign.  Prosecutors have released no details since, and the case remains shrouded in mystery. But this week an independent Russian television station, Dozhd, reported that the men had been arrested on charges that they helped the United States detain a prominent criminal hacker two years before the election.    The United States Secret Service, which investigates some online financial fraud, detained the hacker, Roman V. Seleznev, the son of a member of the Russian Parliament, during a vacation in the Maldives in 2014.   He was accused of stealing credit card data in the United States that was traded in the digital underground. In April, a court sentenced him to 27 years in prison.   That the two Russian officers had helped the Americans detain Mr. Seleznev would not rule out some role for them in the electoral hacking case, as more evidence emerges that the Russian government cooperated with cybercriminals in the election meddling.   In December, for example, the Obama administration imposed sanctions for election meddling against two Russian hackers who were already wanted by the F.B.I. for online fraud.   The pair detained in December were high-ranking employees of the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency to the K.G.B.: Sergei Mikhailov, a deputy director of the agency's computer crime department, the Center for Information Security, and his aide, Dmitri A. Dokuchaev.   In its report on Wednesday, Dozhd cited sources within the F.S.B., whom it did not identify, saying the treason arrests sprang from helping the United States arrest Mr. Seleznev.   ''Specifically, as a result of processing information received from the 'Mikhailov group,' according to those Dozhd spoke with, there was the high-profile arrest in 2014'' of Mr. Seleznev, the television station reported.   The F.S.B. also arrested Ruslan V. Stoyanov, a senior malware researcher with the antivirus company Kaspersky, and Georgy Fomchenkov, a man who more than a decade ago was known to associate with hackers but whose role in the case today is unclear. The arrests remained secret until January, when they were reported by Kommersant, a Russian newspaper.   Thickening the plot of this cyberspy tale, while the Russian prosecutors have accused Mr. Dokuchaev of treason, federal authorities in Washington and San Francisco say that he doubled as a cybercriminal while working for Russia's F.S.B. and that he is wanted for hacking Yahoo and stealing 500 million passwords.   Ivan Y. Pavlov, a defense lawyer specializing in treason cases, has said he represents one of the four accused but was not authorized to say which one. In a post on Facebook on Thursday, Mr. Pavlov denied that the men were accused of assisting the United States in the Seleznev case.   ''I am familiar with the accusation, though for now cannot reveal details,'' he wrote. He suggested the latest leaks were merely ''under-the-rug intrigues of the special services.''     "
"Putin Led a Complex Cyberattack Scheme to Aid Trump, Report Finds","WASHINGTON - President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a vast cyberattack aimed at denying Hillary Clinton the presidency and installing Donald J. Trump in the Oval Office, the nation's top intelligence agencies said in an extraordinary report they delivered on Friday to Mr. Trump. The officials presented their unanimous conclusions to Mr. Trump in a two-hour briefing at Trump Tower in New York that brought the leaders of America's intelligence agencies face to face with their most vocal skeptic, the president-elect, who has repeatedly cast doubt on Russia's role. The meeting came just two weeks before Mr. Trump's inauguration and was underway even as the electoral votes from his victory were being formally counted in a joint session of Congress. Soon after leaving the meeting, intelligence officials released thedeclassified,damning report that described the sophisticated cybercampaign as part of a continuing Russian effort to weaken the United States government and its democratic institutions. The report - a virtually unheard-of, real-time revelation by the American intelligence agencies that undermined the legitimacy of the president who is about to direct them - made the case that Mr. Trump was the favored candidate of Mr. Putin.  The Russian leader, the report said, sought to denigrate Mrs. Clinton, and the report detailed what the officials had revealed to President Obama a day earlier: Mr. Trump's victory followed a complicated, multipart cyberinformation attack whose goal had evolved to help the Republican win. The 25-page report did not conclude that Russian involvement tipped the election to Mr. Trump. The public report lacked the evidence that intelligence officials said was included in a classified version, which they described as information on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates. Those would include intercepts of conversations and the harvesting of computer data from ""implants"" that the United States and its allies have put in Russian computer networks. Much of the unclassified report focused instead on an overt Kremlin propaganda campaign that would be unlikely to convince skeptics of the report's more serious conclusions. The report may be a political blow to Mr. Trump. But it is also a risky moment for the intelligence agencies that have become more powerful since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but have had to fend off allegations that they exaggerated intelligence during the buildup to the Iraq war. The declassified report did describe in detail the efforts of Mr. Putin and his security services, including the creation of the online Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release information gained from the hacks to the public. ""Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,"" the report by the nation's intelligence agencies concluded. Mr. Trump, whose resistance to that very conclusion has led him to repeatedly mock the country's intelligence services on Twitter since Election Day, issued a written statement that appeared to concede some Russian involvement. But Mr. Trump said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin had sought to aid his candidacy, other than insisting that he still believes the Russian attacks had no effect on the outcome. The president-elect's written statement came just hours after Mr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview that the storm surrounding Russian hacking was nothing more than a ""political witch hunt"" carried out by his adversaries, who he said were embarrassed by their loss to him in the 2016 election. Speaking by telephone three hours before the intelligence briefing, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intense focus on Russia. ""China, relatively recently, hacked 20 million government names,"" he said, referring to the breach of computers at the Office of Personnel Management in late 2014 and early 2015. ""How come nobody even talks about that? This is a political witch hunt."" Later, Mr. Trump sought to blame the Democrats for any cyberattacks that might have occurred. ""Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place,"" he said in a Twitter message posted about 11 p.m. ""The Republican National Committee had strong defense!"" Vice President-elect Mike Pence told reporters that he and Mr. Trump had ""appreciated the presentation"" by the intelligence officials and described the conversation as ""respectful."" Mr. Pence said the new administration would take aggressive action ""to combat cyberattacks and protect the security of the American people from this type of intrusion in the future."" Mr. Trump, who has consistently questioned the evidence of Russian hacking during the election, did so again Friday before he met with the intelligence officials. Asked why he thought there was so much attention on the Russian cyberattacks, the president-elect said the motivation was political. He also repeated his criticism of the American intelligence agencies, saying that ""a lot of mistakes were made"" in the past, noting in particular the attacks on the World Trade Center and saying, as he has repeatedly, that ""weapons of mass destruction was one of the great mistakes of all time."" But after meeting with the intelligence officials, Mr. Trump appeared to moderate his position, conceding that ""Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyberinfrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations, including the Democrat National Committee."" The report described a broad campaign of covert operations, including the ""trolling"" on the internet of people who were viewed as opponents of Russia's effort. While it accused Russian intelligence agencies of obtaining and maintaining ""access to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards,"" it concluded - as officials have publicly - that there was no evidence of tampering with the tallying of the vote on Nov. 8. The report, reflecting the assessments of the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, stopped short of backing up Mr. Trump on his declaration that the hacking activity had no effect on the election. ""We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,"" the report concluded, saying it was beyond its responsibility to analyze American ""political processes"" or public opinion. The intelligence agencies also concluded ""with high confidence"" that Russia's main military intelligence unit, the G.R.U., created a ""persona"" called Guccifer 2.0 and a website, DCLeaks.com, to release the emails of the Democratic National Committee and of the chairman of the Clinton campaign, John D. Podesta. When those disclosures received what was seen as insufficient attention, the report said, the G.R.U. ""relayed material it acquired from the D.N.C. and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks."" The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has denied that Russia was the source of the emails it published. The role of RT - the Russian English-language news organization that American intelligence says is a Kremlin propaganda operation - in the Kremlin's effort to influence the election is covered in far more detail by the report than any other aspect of the Russian campaign. An annex in the report on RT, which was first written in 2012 but not previously made public, takes up eight pages of the report's 14-page main section. The report's unequivocal assessment of RT presents an awkward development for Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who is Mr. Trump's choice to serve as national security adviser. Mr. Flynn has appeared repeatedly on RT's news programs and in December 2015 was paid by the network to give a speech in Russia and attend its lavish anniversary party, where he sat at the elbow of Mr. Putin. Mr. Flynn has since defended his speech, insisting that RT is no different from CNN or MSNBC. The report also stated that Russia collected data ""on some Republican-affiliated targets,"" but did not disclose the contents of whatever it harvested. Intelligence officials who prepared the classified report have concluded that British intelligence was among the first to raise an alarm that Moscow hacked into the Democratic National Committee's computer servers, and alerted their American counterparts, according to two people familiar with the conclusions. The British role, which has been closely held, is a critical part of the timeline because it suggests that some of the first tipoffs, in fall 2015, came from voice intercepts, computer traffic or informants outside the United States, as emails and other data from the Democratic National Committee flowed out of the country. The conclusions in the report were described on Thursday to President Obama and on Friday to Mr. Trump by James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; John O. Brennan, the director of the C.I.A.; Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency; and James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I. The key to the public report's assessment is that Russia's motives ""evolved over the course of the campaign."" When it appeared that Mrs. Clinton was more likely to win, it concluded, the Russian effort focused ""on undermining her future presidency,"" with pro-Kremlin bloggers preparing a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #DemocracyRIP. It noted that Mr. Putin had a particular animus for Mrs. Clinton because he believed she had incited protests against him in 2011. Yet the attacks, the report said, began long before anyone could have known that Mr. Trump, considered a dark horse, would win the Republican nomination. It said the attacks began as early as July 2015, when Russian intelligence operatives first gained access to the Democratic National Committee'snetworks. Russia maintained that access for 11 months, until ""at least June 2016,"" the report concludes, leaving open the possibility that Russian cyberattackers may have had access even after the firm CrowdStrike believed that it had kicked them off the networks.

"U.S. Reacting at Analog Pace to a Rising Digital Risk, Hacking Report Shows; News Analysis","Correction Appended WASHINGTON - Of the many questions left unanswered by the American intelligence agencies' accusation that Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, led a multilayered campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election, one stands out: Why did it take the Obama administration more than 16 months to develop a response? The short answer, suggested by the report the agencies released on Friday, is that the United States government is still responding at an analog pace to a low-grade, though escalating, digital conflict. The report, compiled by the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency, makes no judgments about the decisions that the agencies or the White House made as evidence of Russian activity mounted. But to anyone who reads between the lines and knows a bit of the back story not included in the report, the long lag times between detection and reaction are stunning.  The delays reveal fundamental problems with American cyberdefenses and deterrence that President-elect Donald J. Trump will begin to confront in two weeks, regardless of whether he continues to resist the report's findings about Russia's motives. The intrusion hardly had the consequences of Pearl Harbor some 75 years ago, when the incoming force was seen on radar and dismissed. But it had similar characteristics. Then, as now, a failure of imagination about the motives and plans of a longtime adversary meant that government officials were not fully alert to the possibility that Mr. Putin might try tactics here that have worked so well for him in Ukraine, the Baltics and other parts of Europe. And while American intelligence officials - who were focused primarily on the Islamic State and other urgent threats like China's action in the South China Sea and North Korea's nuclear and missile threat - saw what was happening, they came late to its broader implications. It was telling that within an hour of the release of the report on Friday, the secretary of homeland security, Jeh Johnson, declared for the first time that America's election system - the underpinning of its democracy - would be added to the list of ""critical infrastructure."" This after years of cyberattacks on campaigns and government agencies. In the intelligence report's most glaring example of the government's lagging response, it says that ""in July 2015, Russian intelligence gained access to Democratic National Committee networks"" and stayed there for 11 months, roaming freely and copying the contents of emails that it ultimately released in the midst of the election. Classified briefings circulating in Washington indicate that British intelligence had alerted the United States to the intrusion by fall 2015. Almost immediately, a low-level special agent with the F.B.I. alerted the Democratic National Committee's information technology contractor, which doubted the call and did nothing for months. The F.B.I. failed to escalate the issue, even though it was clear from the start that the attackers were almost certainly the same Russians who had mounted similar campaigns against the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At a news conference in December, President Obama made it clear that he was not aware of any of this until mid-2016, nearly a year after the hacking began and the British had sent up a flare. ""At the beginning of the summer,"" Mr. Obama said, ""we're alerted to the possibility that the D.N.C. has been hacked, and I immediately order law enforcement as well as our intelligence teams to find out everything about it"" and to brief ""potential victims"" and ""the relevant intelligence agencies."" It was not until Oct. 7, 2016, 15 months after the initial hacking attack, that the intelligence agencies first publicly blamed Russia. Even then, Mr. Obama made it clear that he did not want to escalate the situation before the election, for fear of getting into a tit-for-tat cyberwar in which Russia might try to alter the actual vote tallying. (It did not.) ""We were just too slow, at every turn,"" one of Mr. Obama's top aides said in an interview late last year. The director of the N.S.A., Adm. Michael S. Rogers, has said the problem was hardly limited to this case. ""The biggest frustration to me is speed, speed, speed,"" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, in response to a question from Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the panel, about the obstacles to seeing a threat from abroad and acting on it here in the United States. ""We have got to get faster; we've got to be more agile,"" said Admiral Rogers, who clashed with White House officials when they thought he was acting too slowly against the Islamic State. ""We can't be bound by history and tradition here. We have to be willing to look at alternatives."" Mr. Putin, for his part, played a weak hand skillfully, blending old information-warfare techniques with the echo chamber created by the internet. It is clear that Mr. Putin saw a huge vulnerability in the American system that was ripe to be exploited. The country's highly partisan politics, with cable channels and websites devoted to pressing an agenda for the fully convinced and the half-convinced, made it more vulnerable to any disclosures that could capture a news cycle. Add to that the uniquely Russian combination of covert espionage and the disclosure of the emails it harvested, as well as the release of ""kompromat"" - compromising information about politicians and policy makers - and ""fake news,"" a tactic not above American officials at times. As the report released on Friday makes clear, this is hardly the end of the story. Elections are coming up in France and Germany, where Mr. Putin has a great interest in the outcomes. Anything that weakens the NATO alliance, in the Kremlin's view, strengthens Russia's hand. And then there is the next election cycle in this country. Until now, when government officials thought about ""critical infrastructure,"" they usually thought of physical places and things: the power grid, the cellphone network, airports and even historical sites, like the Washington Monument. ""Election infrastructure is vital to our national interests, and cyberattacks on this country are becoming more sophisticated, and bad cyberactors - ranging from nation-states, cybercriminals and hacktivists - are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous,"" Mr. Johnson said. The same words could have been written after the Chinese went into the networks of Mr. Obama's campaign and that of his Republican opponent in 2008, Senator John McCain of Arizona. They could have been written after the Iranians responded to the American-Israeli attack on their nuclear facilities by attacking American banks, or when the North Koreans went after Sony Pictures Entertainment in retaliation for a comic film that envisioned the assassination of Kim Jong-un, the nation's leader. And the warning about Russia - a public intelligence report like the one issued on Friday - might have been written after the F.S.B. and the G.R.U., the two major Russian intelligence agencies, struck the computer systems of the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Instead, the government decided not to publicly name who had been behind the attacks. That has changed, at least for now. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump will decide that disclosure or silence is the best policy. Correction: January 7, 2017, Saturday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of months between the initial hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers and the blaming of that attack on Russia.

Flynn's Disdain For Limits Led To a Legal Mire,"WASHINGTON -- Michael T. Flynn was a man seething and thwarted. In the summer of 2014, after repeatedly clashing with other Obama administration officials over his management of the Defense Intelligence Agency -- and what he saw as his unheeded warnings about the rising power of Islamic militants -- Mr. Flynn was fired, bringing his military career to an abrupt end. Mr. Flynn decided that the military's loss would be his gain: He would parlay his contacts, his disdain for conventional bureaucracy, and his intelligence career battling Al Qaeda into a lucrative business advising cybersecurity firms and other government contractors. Over the next two years he would sign on as a consultant to nearly two dozen companies, while carving out a niche as a sought-after author and speaker -- and ultimately becoming a top adviser to President Trump.    ''I've always had that entrepreneurial spirit,'' Mr. Flynn said in an interview in October 2015. In the military, he added, ''I learned that following the way you're supposed to do things isn't always the way to accomplish a task.''    But instead of lofting him into the upper ranks of Beltway bandits, where some other top soldiers have landed, his foray into consulting has become a legal and political quagmire, driven by the same disdain for boundaries that once propelled his rise in the military. His business ties are now the subject of a broad inquiry by a special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with Trump associates. That investigation now includes work Mr. Flynn did for Russian clients and for a Turkish businessman with ties to that country's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.   Mr. Flynn sometimes seemed to be trying to achieve through business what he could not accomplish in government. He believed that the United States was engaged in a ''world war'' against Islamist militants, and that Washington's national security elite had so thoroughly politicized the country's intelligence agencies that few left in government could see the threat. The United States, he believed, needed to take a tougher line against the Islamic State, and it needed to cultivate Russia as an ally in the fight.   ''He got out of the service and had a passion to reform the intelligence community, where he saw some deficiencies,'' said Todd Wilcox, a former Green Beret and C.I.A. officer who founded Patriot Capital, a Florida-based defense contractor that named Mr. Flynn to an advisory board in 2015.   But Mr. Flynn also became entangled with controversial clients. One company that paid him, OSY Technologies, is part of a cyberweapons company whose software has been used to hack Mexican activists and an opposition leader in the Middle East. Another, a Boston company selling a technology to replace lie detectors, is accused by its former chief scientist of marketing a counterfeit version of his technology to foreign clients.   Dozens of interviews and a review of public documents suggest that Mr. Flynn's business was as scattershot as it was ambitious -- and that there were few opportunities he would pass up. His clients ranged from a drone manufacturer in Florida to major software companies; at one point, Mr. Flynn took a $5,000 gig as an expert witness in a personal injury case. Some of his clients came through a tight-knit circle of Iranian-Americans, one of whom became a key partner in Mr. Flynn's businesses.   Mr. Flynn's work paid well -- while it lasted. Financial disclosure forms released in March showed income of between $1.37 million and $1.47 million for a period that roughly covered 2016, the bulk of it from the Flynn Intel Group.   Mr. Flynn closed the Flynn Intel Group at the end of 2016, as he planned to join the Trump administration. But within months, he was fired as Mr. Trump's national security adviser; the White House has said he was forced out for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Now under scrutiny by the F.B.I. and congressional investigators, Mr. Flynn faces legal bills that are well into the six figures, and former clients are scrambling to distance themselves from the ex-general whose counsel they once avidly sought.   Mr. Flynn declined to comment for this article, and his lawyer, Robert Kelner, declined to answer questions from The New York Times. But in an interview not long ago, Mr. Flynn expressed pride in his moneymaking skills. ''I'm a capitalist at heart,'' Mr. Flynn said in October. ''If I've discovered anything, it's that I'm a good businessman.''   A New Consulting Business   In the fall of 2014, Mr. Flynn registered his new company, Flynn Intel Group, from an Alexandria, Va., townhouse owned by Stanley A. McChrystal, a friend and fellow general-turned-consultant. Among his first clients was Palo Alto Networks, a rising Silicon Valley firm seeking to win more government contracts. A few months later, he inked a deal with the software giant Adobe, which paid him a six-figure fee to provide ''periodic counsel to Adobe's public sector team,'' according to a company spokeswoman.   But Mr. Flynn also joined the board of a little-known company called GreenZone Systems, which marketed secure mobile communications systems. GreenZone was run by Bijan R. Kian, an Iranian-American businessman who served until 2011 as a director of the U.S. Export-Import Bank. A friend of Mr. Kian, the businessman Nasser Kazeminy, also hired Mr. Flynn as an adviser.   Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kian soon found a third partner: Philip Oakley, a former Army intelligence analyst, longtime Flynn friend, and owner of two small companies that provided software for defense and intelligence clients. They restarted Flynn Intel Group in June 2015, according to Delaware corporate records, pitching themselves as a premier private intelligence and cybersecurity advisory firm.   None of the partners responded to repeated attempts to contact them. But their business interests were closely intermingled. Beginning in 2015, Mr. Oakley's firms employed Mr. Flynn as an adviser and paid him $90,000 in salary over 11 months.   Jim McGuire, a business partner of Mr. Kazeminy, said in an email that Mr. Flynn had provided guidance on public sector business opportunities.   Mr. McGuire declined to say whether GreenZone had won any government business during Mr. Flynn's tenure as an adviser, which ended last fall. If Mr. Oakley thought joining with Mr. Flynn would turbocharge his business, he may have been disappointed: Mr. Oakley's companies do not appear to have received any new contracting work directly from the federal government, though government databases do not reliably include subcontractors.   Mr. Flynn continued to collect advisory board memberships, however: His credentials were a marketable asset. Fledgling contractors like Patriot Capital, Mr. Wilcox said, use advisory boards to ''build some gravitas.''   Links to Russian Firms   Yet even as Mr. Flynn consulted for American cybersecurity companies, he was developing closer financial ties to Russia, a country whose own intelligence apparatus was moving aggressively to penetrate United States government systems. In 2015, Mr. Flynn accepted a payment from Kaspersky Lab, a Russian research firm that works to uncover Western government spyware and whose founder has long been suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence services.   In 2015, the firm's American subsidiary, Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc., paid him $11,250. The same year, Mr. Flynn received the same amount from Volga-Dnepr Airlines, a Russian carrier that has been examined by the United Nations for bribery.   Both payments were for unspecified ''services'' provided by Mr. Flynn, according to a letter sent to the White House in March by Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, which is examining Mr. Flynn's financial dealings. Kaspersky has said that Mr. Flynn was paid for remarks he delivered at a 2015 cybersecurity forum in Washington.   In December 2015, Mr. Flynn traveled to Moscow for a paid speaking engagement on behalf of RT, the Kremlin-financed news network that American intelligence agencies say is a Russian propaganda outlet. RT paid Mr. Flynn $45,000 for the trip, which also included an invitation to a lavish anniversary party for the network, where he was photographed sitting at the elbow of President Vladimir V. Putin.   The three payments from Russian companies are among the issues being investigated by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the Justice Department inquiry.   Mr. Flynn believed that Moscow could be cultivated as an ally against Islamist militants. As director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he had even visited the headquarters of the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence service.   His colleagues in the American intelligence community took a less favorable view, especially when he continued to push for closer ties after Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014. They believed Mr. Flynn was willing to be used by Russia if he could advance his views on forging a united front to battle the Islamic State.   A Growing List of Clients   By early 2016, Mr. Flynn's public profile was rising. He had signed a book deal and began hitting the public speaking circuit. The rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria seemed to validate his criticism of Obama administration policy, and Mr. Flynn soon become a regular adviser to Mr. Trump's insurgent presidential campaign.   But behind the scenes, his client list was also expanding.   That May, Mr. Flynn joined the advisory board of OSY Technologies, part of the NSO Group, a secretive cyberweapons dealer founded by former Israeli intelligence officials. He also consulted with Francisco Partners, an American private equity firm that controls NSO Group.   The same year, the company's products were linked to an attempt to hack the cellphone of Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates. They were also used to harass public health advocates of a Mexican soda tax, who began receiving threatening text messages.   In a statement, NSO said it ''only develops the software, and is not involved in any way, shape or form in operating the system.''   Steve Eisner, the general counsel of Francisco Partners, suggested that Mr. Flynn had served the company in a relatively limited advisory role.   ''We routinely engage consultants to help us understand industries that we are investing in,'' Mr. Eisner said. Mr. Flynn was paid a little more than $40,000 by OSY, and ''less than $100,000'' by Francisco, Mr. Eisner said.   Another client was Brainwave Science, a tiny Massachusetts company that purports to have technology that can scan the brain to determine if someone is lying.   Dr. Lawrence A. Farwell, the company's former chief scientist and inventor of its technology, said in an interview that Brainwave was using a counterfeit version of his work and was the target of a federal investigation related to its product. He declined to provide further details.   A man previously listed as one of the company's board members, Subrahmanyam M. Kota, the head of an I.T. consulting firm called the Boston Group, was caught in a sting in the 1990s and accused of trying to sell secrets to the K.G.B. As part of a deal that involved his testimony against another defendant, he eventually pleaded guilty to charges related to theft and tax evasion.   Mr. Kota denied in an interview that he had served on the board of Brainwave; Dr. Farwell said Mr. Kota was actually the principal investor. A lawyer for Brainwave declined to answer questions about the dispute with Dr. Farwell or Mr. Flynn's work for the company.   Dr. Farwell added that he had warned Mr. Flynn against getting involved with the company. ''I'm not going to make any representations as to what Flynn's positions or words were, but I was in communication with him directly, and with his staff,'' Dr. Farwell said.   A Slapdash Effort   By the fall of 2016, Mr. Flynn was spending significant time on the campaign trail with Mr. Trump. Back in Washington, Mr. Kian brought in a new client: A prominent Turkish businessman named Ekim Alptekin, who headed a Turkish trade association with ties to the country's government.   Mr. Alptekin had come to know Mr. Kian during Mr. Kian's days at the Export-Import Bank, Mr. Alptekin said in an interview this month. Last fall, after the failed July 2016 coup against the Turkish president, he wanted to fight back against those whom Mr. Erdogan blamed for the attempt: members of the Islamic religious movement led by Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999.   ''Like many Americans rolling up their sleeves in 9/11 to do something, I decided to do something,'' Mr. Alptekin said.   His public explanations for hiring the Flynn Intel Group have not always been consistent: In March, he told a reporter that Mr. Flynn had been hired ''to produce geopolitical analysis on Turkey and the region'' for an Israeli energy company.   Mr. Alptekin now says that he wanted to hire a credible American firm to lead a public relations campaign against the Gulenists. Mr. Kian suggested the Flynn Intel Group, Mr. Alptekin said -- though without disclosing his own involvement with the firm.   ''You need independent work; you need research that is done by Americans,'' Mr. Alptekin said. ''Flynn was well credentialed; he was a head of D.I.A.''   The Flynn Intel Group promised what sounded like a sophisticated research and lobbying effort, employing former intelligence and military veterans, and led by Mr. Flynn himself. The company would produce a documentary and seek to persuade members of Congress that Mr. Gulen ought to be extradited. Mr. Alptekin agreed to pay $600,000 for the work.   But the effort appears to have been slapdash from the start, according to several people involved in the effort, who asked for anonymity because of the continuing federal investigations.   Mr. Flynn had little to say during meetings, though he would hand out signed copies of his book at each one. A former United States intelligence operative named Mike Boston appeared to be quarterbacking the assignment, but according to one person involved, he mostly sat in the corner or paced around the room saying nothing.   Mr. Flynn's partners also appeared unsure of what legal requirements they faced, according to another person involved in the project. Yet another Kian friend, a lawyer named Robert Kelley, was brought in for advice, and later filed a lobbying disclosure on the company's behalf, indicating that its client was Mr. Alptekin's company, Inovo BV.   Mr. Kian later disclosed that he met twice in October 2016 with staff members for the House Committee on Homeland Security. According to a report in The Daily Caller, Mr. Kian at first pitched them on technology developed by GreenZone, the contracting firm he also ran. But at the second meeting, Mr. Kian initiated a discussion of the Gulen research, surprising the Hill staffers.   Mr. Flynn did not attend those meetings. But the day after the election, he published an op-ed calling Mr. Gulen ''a shady Islamic mullah'' and comparing his movement to the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr. Alptekin said he advised Mr. Kian against publishing the op-ed and that the Flynn Intel Group eventually refunded the lobbying portion of his payments.   But the op-ed caught the attention of Justice Department lawyers, who opened an investigation into whether Mr. Flynn was in fact working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey -- a matter that is now part of Mr. Mueller's broader inquiry into Mr. Trump's inner circle.   Months later, in March, Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kian filed additional disclosures under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The new disclosures acknowledged that the Gulen project ''could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.''   Around $270,000 worth of the fees Mr. Alptekin paid to Flynn Intel Group are not accounted for in the foreign agent disclosure, which details payments to roughly a dozen other individuals and firms associated with the Gulen project.   Mr. Alptekin says he does not know where the money went.   Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.     "
"To Sway Vote, Russia Used Army of Fake Americans","Sometimes an international offensive begins with a few shots that draw little notice. So it was last year when Melvin Redick of Harrisburg, Pa., a friendly-looking American with a backward baseball cap and a young daughter, posted on Facebook a link to a brand-new website. ''These guys show hidden truth about Hillary Clinton, George Soros and other leaders of the US,'' he wrote on June 8, 2016. ''Visit #DCLeaks website. It's really interesting!''    Mr. Redick turned out to be a remarkably elusive character. No Melvin Redick appears in Pennsylvania records, and his photos seem to be borrowed from an unsuspecting Brazilian. But this fictional concoction has earned a small spot in history: The Redick posts that morning were among the first public signs of an unprecedented foreign intervention in American democracy.   The DCLeaks site had gone live a few days earlier, posting the first samples of material, stolen from prominent Americans by Russian hackers, that would reverberate through the presidential election campaign and into the Trump presidency. The site's phony promoters were in the vanguard of a cyberarmy of counterfeit Facebook and Twitter accounts, a legion of Russian-controlled impostors whose operations are still being unraveled.    The Russian information attack on the election did not stop with the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails or the fire hose of stories, true, false and in between, that battered Mrs. Clinton on Russian outlets like RT and Sputnik. Far less splashy, and far more difficult to trace, was Russia's experimentation on Facebook and Twitter, the American companies that essentially invented the tools of social media and, in this case, did not stop them from being turned into engines of deception and propaganda.   An investigation by The New York Times, and new research from the cybersecurity firm FireEye, reveals some of the mechanisms by which suspected Russian operators used Twitter and Facebook to spread anti-Clinton messages and promote the hacked material they had leaked. On Wednesday, Facebook officials disclosed that they had shut down several hundred accounts that they believe were created by a Russian company linked to the Kremlin and used to buy $100,000 in ads pushing divisive issues during and after the American election campaign.   On Twitter, as on Facebook, Russian fingerprints are on hundreds or thousands of fake accounts that regularly posted anti-Clinton messages. Many were automated Twitter accounts, called bots, that sometimes fired off identical messages seconds apart -- and in the exact alphabetical order of their made-up names, according to the FireEye researchers. On Election Day, for instance, they found that one group of Twitter bots sent out the hashtag #WarAgainstDemocrats more than 1,700 times.   The Russian efforts were sometimes crude or off-key, with a trial-and-error feel, and many of the suspect posts were not widely shared. The fakery may have added only modestly to the din of genuine American voices in the pre-election melee, but it helped fuel a fire of anger and suspicion in a polarized country.   Given the powerful role of social media in political contests, understanding the Russian efforts will be crucial in preventing or blunting similar, or more sophisticated, attacks in the 2018 congressional races and the 2020 presidential election. Multiple government agencies have investigated the Russian attack, though it remains unclear whether any agency is focused specifically on tracking foreign intervention in social media. Both Facebook and Twitter say they are studying the 2016 experience and how to defend against such meddling.   ''We know we have to stay vigilant to keep ahead of people who try to misuse our platform,'' Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief security officer, wrote on Wednesday in a post about the Russia-linked fake accounts and ads. ''We believe in protecting the integrity of civic discourse.''   Critics say that because shareholders judge the companies partly based on a crucial data point -- ''monthly active users'' -- they are reluctant to police their sites too aggressively for fear of reducing that number. The companies use technical tools and teams of analysts to detect bogus accounts, but the scale of the sites -- 328 million users on Twitter, nearly two billion on Facebook -- means they often remove impostors only in response to complaints.   Though both companies have been slow to grapple with the problem of manipulation, they have stepped up efforts to purge fake accounts. Facebook says it takes down a million accounts a day -- including some that were related to the recent French election and upcoming German voting -- but struggles to keep up with the illicit activity. Still, the company says the abuse affects only a small fraction of the social network; Facebook officials estimated that of all the ''civic content'' posted on the site in connection with the United States election, less than one-tenth of one percent resulted from ''information operations'' like the Russian campaign.   Twitter, unlike Facebook, does not require the use of a real name and does not prohibit automated accounts, arguing that it seeks to be a forum for open debate. But it constantly updates a ''trends'' list of most-discussed topics or hashtags, and it says it tries to foil attempts to use bots to create fake trends. However, FireEye found that the suspected Russian bots sometimes managed to do just that, in one case causing the hashtag #HillaryDown to be listed as a trend.   Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has closely tracked Russian activity online, said that Facebook and Twitter suffered from a ''bot cancer eroding trust on their platforms.'' But he added that while Facebook ''has begun cutting out the tumors by deleting false accounts and fighting fake news,'' Twitter has done little and as a result, ''bots have only spread since the election.''   Asked to comment, Twitter referred to a blog post in June in which it said it was ''doubling down'' on efforts to prevent manipulation but could not reveal details for fear of tipping off those trying to evade the company's measures. But it declared that Twitter's ''open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote'' to falsehoods.   ''This is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single Tweet from every person is truthful or not,'' the statement said. ''We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.''   Leaks and Counterfeit Profiles   Russia has been quite open about playing its hacking card. In February last year, at a conference in Moscow, a top cyberintelligence adviser to President Vladimir V. Putin hinted that Russia was about to unleash a devastating information attack on the United States.   ''We are living in 1948,'' said the adviser, Andrey Krutskikh, referring to the eve of the first Soviet atomic bomb test, in a speech reported by The Washington Post. ''I'm warning you: We are at the verge of having something in the information arena that will allow to us to talk to the Americans as equals.''   Mr. Putin's denials of Russian meddling have been coy. In June, he allowed that ''free-spirited'' hackers might have awakened in a good mood one day and spontaneously decided to contribute to ''the fight against those who say bad things about Russia.'' Speaking to NBC News, he rejected the idea that evidence pointed to Russia -- while showing a striking familiarity with how cyberattackers might cover their tracks.   ''IP addresses can be simply made up,'' Mr. Putin said, referring to Internet protocol addresses, which can identify particular computers. ''There are such IT specialists in the world today, and they can arrange anything and then blame it on whomever. This is no proof.''   Mr. Putin had a point. Especially in the social media realm, attributing fake accounts -- to Russia or to any other source -- is always challenging. In January, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded ''with high confidence'' that Mr. Putin had ordered an influence operation to damage Mrs. Clinton's campaign and eventually aid Donald J. Trump's. In April, Facebook published a public report on information operations using fake accounts. It shied away from naming Russia as the culprit until Wednesday, when the company said it had removed 470 ''inauthentic'' accounts and pages that were ''likely operated out of Russia.'' Facebook officials fingered a St. Petersburg company with Kremlin ties called the Internet Research Agency.   Russia deliberately blurs its role in influence operations, American intelligence officials say. Even skilled investigators often cannot be sure if a particular Facebook post or Twitter bot came from Russian intelligence employees, paid ''trolls'' in Eastern Europe or hackers from Russia's vast criminal underground. A Russian site called buyaccs.com (''Buy Bulk Accounts at Best Prices'') offers for sale a huge array of pre-existing social media accounts, including on Facebook and Twitter; like wine, the older accounts cost more, because their history makes chicanery harder to spot.   The trail that leads from the Russian operation to the bogus Melvin Redick, however, is fairly clear. United States intelligence concluded that DCLeaks.com was created in June 2016 by the Russian military intelligence agency G.R.U. The site began publishing an eclectic collection of hacked emails, notably from George Soros, the financier and Democratic donor, as well as a former NATO commander and some Democratic and Republican staffers. Some of the website's language -- calling Mrs. Clinton ''President of the Democratic Party'' and referring to her ''electional staff'' -- seemed to belie its pose as a forum run by American activists.   DCLeaks would soon be followed by a blog called Guccifer 2.0, which would leave even more clues of its Russian origin. Those sites' posts, however, would then be dwarfed by those from WikiLeaks, which American officials believe got thousands of Democratic emails from Russian intelligence hackers through an intermediary. At each stage, a chorus of dubious Facebook and Twitter accounts -- alongside many legitimate ones -- would applaud the leaks.   During its first weeks online, DCLeaks drew no media attention. But The Times found that some Facebook users somehow discovered the new site quickly and began promoting it on June 8. One was the Redick account, which posted about DCLeaks to the Facebook groups ''World News Headlines'' and ''Breaking News -- World.''   The Redick profile lists Central High School in Philadelphia and Indiana University of Pennsylvania as his alma maters; neither has any record of his attendance. In one of his photos, this purported Pennsylvania lifer is sitting in a restaurant in Brazil -- and in another, his daughter's bedroom appears to have a Brazilian-style electrical outlet. His posts were never personal, just news articles reflecting a pro-Russian worldview.   The same morning, ''Katherine Fulton'' also began promoting DCLeaks in the same awkward English Mr. Redick used. ''Hey truth seekers!'' she wrote. ''Who can tell me who are #DCLeaks? Some kind of Wikileaks? You should visit their website, it contains confidential information about our leaders such as Hillary Clinton, and others http://dcleaks.com/.''   So did ''Alice Donovan,'' who pointed to documents from Mr. Soros's Open Society Foundations that she said showed its pro-American tilt and -- in rather formal language for Facebook -- ''describe eventual means and plans of supporting opposition movements, groups or individuals in various countries.''   Might Mr. Redick, Ms. Fulton, Ms. Donovan and others be real Americans who just happened to notice DCLeaks the same day? No. The Times asked Facebook about these and a half-dozen other accounts that appeared to be Russian creations. The company carried out its standard challenge procedure by asking the users to establish their bona fides. All the suspect accounts failed and were removed from Facebook.   Mobilizing a 'Bot' Army   On Twitter, meanwhile, hundreds of accounts were busy posting anti-Clinton messages and promoting the leaked material obtained by Russian hackers. Investigators for FireEye spent months reviewing Twitter accounts associated with certain online personas, posing as activists, that seemed to show the Russian hand: DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, Anonymous Poland and several others. FireEye concluded that they were associated with one another and with Russian hacking groups, including APT28 or Fancy Bear, which American intelligence blames for the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails.   Some accounts, the researchers found, showed clear signs of intermittent human control. But most displayed the rote behavior of automated Twitter bots, which send out tweets according to built-in instructions.   The researchers discovered long lists of bot accounts that sent out identical messages within seconds or minutes of one another, firing in alphabetical order. The researchers coined the term ''warlist'' for them. On Election Day, one such list cited leaks from Anonymous Poland in more than 1,700 tweets. Snippets of them provide a sample of the sequence:   @edanur01 #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54   @efekinoks #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54   @elyashayk #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54   @emrecanbalc #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:55   @emrullahtac #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:55   Lee Foster, who leads the FireEye team examining information operations, said some of the warlist Twitter accounts had previously been used for illicit marketing, suggesting that they may have been purchased on the black market. Some were genuine accounts that had been hijacked. Rachel Usedom, a young American engineer in California, tweeted mostly about her sorority before losing interest in 2014. In November 2016, her account was taken over, renamed #ClintonCurruption, and used to promote the Russian leaks.   Ms. Usedom had no idea that her account had been commandeered by anti-Clinton propagandists. ''I was shocked and slightly confused when I found out,'' she said.   Notably, the warlist tweets often included the Twitter handles of users whose attention the senders wanted to catch -- news organizations, journalists, government agencies and politicians, including @realDonaldTrump. By targeting such opinion-shapers, Mr. Foster said, the creators of the warlists clearly wanted to stir up conversation about the leaked material.   J. M. Berger, a researcher in Cambridge, Mass., helped build a public web ''dashboard'' for the Washington-based Alliance for Securing Democracy to track hundreds of Twitter accounts that were suspected of links to Russia or that spread Russian propaganda. During the campaign, he said, he often saw the accounts post replies to Mr. Trump's tweets.   Mr. Trump ''received more direct replies than anyone else,'' Mr. Berger said. ''Clearly this was an effort to influence Donald Trump. They know he reads tweets.''   The suspected Russian operators at times lacked sophistication. ''They are not always Americanophiles who know every nuance of U.S. politics,'' said Mr. Foster, the FireEye researcher.   For instance, last October, hundreds of Anonymous Poland Twitter accounts posted a forged letter on the stationery of the conservative Bradley Foundation, based in Milwaukee, purporting to show that it had donated $150 million to the Clinton campaign. The foundation denied any such contribution, which would have been illegal and, given its political leaning, highly unlikely.   'A Battle of Information'   Only a small fraction of all the suspect social media accounts active during the election have been studied by investigators. But there is ample reason to suspect that the Russian meddling may have been far more widespread.   Several activists who ran Facebook pages for Bernie Sanders, for instance, noticed a suspicious flood of hostile comments about Mrs. Clinton after Mr. Sanders had already ended his campaign and endorsed her.   John Mattes, who ran the ''San Diego for Bernie Sanders'' page, said he saw a shift from familiar local commenters to newcomers, some with Eastern European names -- including four different accounts using the name ''Oliver Mitov.''   ''Those who voted for Bernie, will not vote for corrupt Hillary!'' one of the Mitovs wrote on Oct. 7. ''The Revolution must continue! #NeverHillary''   While he was concerned about being seen as a ''crazy cold warrior,'' Mr. Mattes said he came to believe that Russia was the likely source of the anti-Clinton comments. ''The magnitude and viciousness of it -- I would suggest that their fingerprints were on it and no one else had that agenda,'' he said.   Both on the left and the pro-Trump right, though, some skeptics complain that Moscow has become the automatic boogeyman, accused of misdeeds with little proof. Even those who track Russian online activity admit that in the election it was not always easy to sort out who was who.   ''Yes, the Russians were involved. Yes, there's a lot of organic support for Trump,'' said Andrew Weisburd, an Illinois online researcher who has written frequently about Russian influence on social media. ''Trying to disaggregate the two was difficult, to put it mildly.''   Mr. Weisburd said he had labeled some Twitter accounts ''Kremlin trolls'' based simply on their pro-Russia tweets and with no proof of Russian government ties. The Times contacted several such users, who insisted that they had come by their anti-American, pro-Russian views honestly, without payment or instructions from Moscow.   ''Hillary's a warmonger,'' said Marilyn Justice, 66, who lives in Nova Scotia and tweets as @mkj1951. Of Mr. Putin, she said in an interview, ''I think he's very patient in the face of provocations.''   Ms. Justice said she had first taken an interest in Russia during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, while looking for hockey coverage and finding what she considered a snide anti-Russia bias in the Western media. She said she did get a lot of news from Sputnik and RT but laughed at the notion that she could have Kremlin connections.   Another of the so-called Kremlin trolls, Marcel Sardo, 48, a web producer in Zurich, describes himself bluntly on his Twitter bio as a ''Pro-Russia Media-Sniper.'' He said he shared notes daily via Skype and Twitter with online acquaintances, including Ms. Justice, on disputes between Russia and the West over who shot down the Malaysian airliner hit by a missile over Ukraine and who used sarin gas in Syria.   ''It's a battle of information, and I and my peers have decided to take sides,'' said Mr. Sardo, who constantly cites Russian sources and bashed Mrs. Clinton daily during the campaign. But he denied he had any links to the Russian government.   If that's so, his prolific posts are a victory for Russia's information war -- that admirers of the Kremlin spread what American officials consider to be Russian disinformation on election hacking, Syria, Ukraine and more.   But if Russian officials are gleeful at their success, in last year's election and beyond, they rarely let the mask slip. In an interview with Bloomberg before the election, Mr. Putin suggested that reporters were worrying too much about who exactly stole the material.   ''Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data?'' he said, in a point that Mr. Trump has sometimes echoed. ''The important thing is the content that was given to the public.''     "
What Intelligence Agencies Concluded About the Russian Attack on the U.S. Election,"The office of the director of national intelligence on Friday released a long-awaited unclassified version of its report for President Obama on what the intelligence agencies said was a multifaceted attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election. The report included only the agencies' conclusions, not the actual intelligence or technical information on which they were based.  Here are some major findings, with comments by The New York Times. The full report is available here.  A strong statement from three intelligence agencies.  In unequivocal language, the report pins responsibility for the election attack directly on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, ruling out the possibility that it was ordered by intelligence officials or simply carried out by Kremlin supporters.  United States officials believe Mr. Putin wants to damage the image of American democracy to make it less attractive to Russians and their neighbors. _____ Russia took sides in the U.S. election.  Notably, the report concludes that Russia sought not only to damage Hillary Clinton, whom it thought likely to win, but actually tried to help elect Donald J. Trump.  The C.I.A., F.B.I. and N.S.A. agreed on nearly everything in the report, but here we see that the N.S.A. was less certain than the other agencies that Russia was trying to help Mr. Trump. _____ Putin saw this attack as payback.  An important insight into Mr. Putin's thinking: He already blamed the United States for multiple campaigns against Russia, including the release of the Panama Papers, showing offshore accounts hiding the fortunes of some of his closest friends and allies, and the exposure of Russian athletes for doping. For him, this was payback.  There is no evidence suggesting that the United States government had a role in releasing the Panama Papers, and while American officials complained of Russian doping, there is no basis to suggest that they fabricated evidence of it. _____ Putin held a grudge against Clinton.  The election attack was personal, the report concludes: Mr. Putin thought Mrs. Clinton had insulted him and encouraged demonstrations against him in Russia. _____ Trump's business background appealed to Putin.  A new observation: Mr. Putin has enjoyed close relations with some Western leaders who had personal business ties to Russia. The report suggests he may have seen Mr. Trump in a similar light, though the Trump Organization has no major projects in Russia. _____ The election attack was part of a larger campaign.  While the intelligence agencies see the leak of hacked materials to influence the election as ""unprecedented,"" they view it as part of a familiar Russian information strategy using every form of contemporary media to influence public opinion. _____ The hacking was done by Russian intelligence.  The report's most specific finding on hacking tracks with what cybersecurity experts have said: that two different hacking groups attacked Democratic targets, one described here as ""Russian intelligence,"" the other more specifically as the G.R.U., Russian military intelligence.  Contrary to expectations, the report says nothing about the forensic analysis or American spying on which the conclusions are based. _____ The key was not hacking but leaking.  Here the report accuses the Russian government of going beyond standard cyberespionage, in which hacking is used to get information, to an attack by releasing the information to influence the election.  As expected, the agencies accuse the G.R.U. of being behind Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks.com, two outlets that released hacked emails and documents, and with supplying hacked emails to WikiLeaks, though it does not suggest WikiLeaks editors necessarily knew the source. _____ Evidence that Russia was happy Trump won.  The report cites positive Russian news coverage of Mr. Trump's victory as confirmation that Mr. Putin's government took sides in the election.  In the agencies' view, the Russian government sees Mr. Trump's victory as one in a series of wins for populist movements championed by Mr. Putin. _____ This will happen again.  The report suggests that Mr. Putin believes the combination of hacking and leaks is a low-risk, high-impact way to influence other countries - and that Russia is likely to keep trying the same methods against the United States and other countries.

"Russian Hackers Gained 'Limited' Access to R.N.C., Comey Says","WASHINGTON - The director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, told lawmakers at a Senate hearing on Tuesday that Russian hackers had penetrated the Republican National Committee's computer records, but he called it a ""limited penetration of old R.N.C."" computer systems that were ""no longer in use."" Mr. Comey's statement was significant because the committee said weeks ago that it did not lose data to the Russians because of its strong cybersecurity. President-elect Donald J. Trump has repeated that assertion and has also said weaknesses in Democratic National Committee systems had opened the way for their systems to be hacked.  While Mr. Comey did not go into detail, he appeared to be referring to a Russian-led attack on a contractor in Tennessee, Smartech Corporation, used by the Republican committee to host some of its websites and handle some lists of donors. Federal investigators have said that a single email server used by that contractor had been penetrated. But it was going out of service and contained outdated material that the Russians probably found to be of little value. People with direct knowledge of the server's contents said it had been used by Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain. An aide in Mr. Graham's office said the hacking of the email server in question occurred in June. The Graham campaign was using the server to send news clips and campaign releases, the aide said. In an unclassified report released on Friday, the intelligence community reported that the Russians had attacked ""Republican-affiliated"" organizations but that they had chosen not to make any of that data public. The report made no specific reference to the Republican National Committee. Pressed on the issue by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Mr. Comey said on Tuesday that there was ""evidence of hacking directed at the state level"" and at the Republican committee, ""but that it was old stuff."" He said there was no evidence ""that the current R.N.C."" - he appeared to be referring to servers at the committee's headquarters or contractors with current data - had been hacked. There is no evidence that computers used by the Trump campaign or the Clinton campaign were also compromised, though the personal email account of John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, was copied and released as part of the Russian-ordered hack. The testimony on Tuesday was the first since the release of the declassified report on Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, and it came four days after the findings were described to Mr. Trump. The panel, convened by the Senate Intelligence Committee, included James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and of the military's Cyber Command. John O. Brennan, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Mr. Comey also testified. Mr. Clapper largely repeated the conclusions of last week's report, including that the goal of the Russian effort was to disparage Mrs. Clinton - whom the Russians hoped to weaken if she won - and over time to favor Mr. Trump. Under questioning, Mr. Clapper said he believed that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his aides had actively ordered the operation that resulted in the hacking, though he left unclear how involved they may have been in the details. After receiving a briefing on the report on Friday, Mr. Trump acknowledged for the first time that Russia had sought to hack into the Democratic National Committee's computer systems. But he insisted that the effort had played no role in his election, and he said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin preferred him to Mrs. Clinton. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the committee's vice chairman, called the election hacking ""one of the most serious events of my public life."" At times, Democrats on the committee steered the conversation toward whether intelligence officials were investigating any link between the Russians and Mr. Trump's campaign. But Mr. Comey declined to discuss it. ""Especially in a public forum, we never confirm or deny any investigation,"" Mr. Comey said. Many Democrats still blame him for Mrs. Clinton's defeat, citing his ambiguous letter less than two weeks before the election disclosing new questions about emails on her private server. Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, who supported Mrs. Clinton, could not resist an aside. ""The irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid,"" he said. Mr. Comey, seeking to establish a nonpartisan air, later joked, ""I hope I've demonstrated by now I'm tone deaf when it comes to politics - and that's the way it should be."" Republicans, for their part, raised few doubts about the intelligence community's conclusions, but they dwelled little on the report's finding that Mr. Putin had a clear preference for Mr. Trump. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, suggested that Russia had achieved its broader goal of sowing ""chaos and disorder"" in the electoral system.

Such Currency. Much Risk.,"Jackson Palmer no longer thinks it's funny to imitate Doge, the internet meme about a Shiba Inu dog whose awe-struck expressions and garbled syntax (e.g. ''Wow. So pizza. Much delicious.'') made him a viral sensation several years ago. But if he did, he might channel Doge to offer a few cautionary words for investors who are falling for cryptocurrency start-ups, Silicon Valley's latest moneymaking craze:    Very bubble. Much scam. So avoid.   Mr. Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin, was an early fan of cryptocurrency, a form of encrypted digital money that is traded from person to person. He saw investors talking about Bitcoin, the oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, and wanted to find a way to poke fun at the hype surrounding the emerging technology.    So in 2013, he built his own cryptocurrency, a satirical mash-up that combined Bitcoin with the Doge meme he'd seen on social media. Mr. Palmer hoped to use Dogecoin to show the absurdity of wagering huge sums of money on unstable ventures.   But investors didn't get the joke and bought Dogecoin anyway, bringing its market value as high as $400 million. Along the way, the currency became a magnet for greed and attracted a group of scammers and hackers who defrauded investors, hyped fake products, and left many of the currency's original backers empty-handed.   Today, Mr. Palmer, 30, is one of the loudest voices warning that a similar fate might soon befall the entire cryptocurrency industry.   ''What's happening to crypto now is what happened to Dogecoin,'' Mr. Palmer told me in a recent interview. ''I'm worried that this time, it's on a much grander scale.''   Already, there are signs of trouble on the horizon. This week, after Chinese authorities announced a crackdown on virtual currencies, the value of Bitcoin briefly tumbled 30 percent before partially recovering. The value of Dogecoin fell more than 50 percent last week. Its market value by midday Friday was about $100 million.   But there remains no bigger mania among tech investors than cryptocurrency, which some see as an eventual replacement for traditional, government-issued money. Even with the recent declines, the price of Bitcoin has more than tripled this year; another cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has gained more than 2,300 percent. The success of these currencies has minted a new class of ''crypto-millionaires'' and spawned hundreds of other digital currencies, called altcoins. In addition, it has given rise to an entire category of start-ups that take advantage of cryptocurrency's public ledger system, known as the blockchain.   Many cryptocurrency start-ups have raised money through an initial coin offering, or I.C.O., a type of fund-raising campaign in which investors buy into a new venture using Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency and receive virtual ''tokens'' instead of stock or voting rights in the company. These tokens grant investors access to a product or service that will be built with the money raised in the I.C.O., such as cloud data storage or access to a new social network.   (If you're having trouble picturing it: Imagine that a friend is building a casino and asks you to invest. In exchange, you get chips that can be used at the casino's tables once it's finished. Now imagine that the value of the chips isn't fixed, and will instead fluctuate depending on the popularity of the casino, the number of other gamblers and the regulatory environment for casinos. Oh, and instead of a friend, imagine it's a stranger on the internet who might be using a fake name, who might not actually know how to build a casino, and whom you probably can't sue for fraud if he steals your money and uses it to buy a Porsche instead. That's an I.C.O.)   Despite the obvious risks of these ventures, investor appetite has been ravenous. A group of Bay Area programmers this year used an I.C.O. to raise $35 million for their project, an anonymous web browser called Brave, in less than 30 seconds. There have been 140 coin offerings in 2017 that have raised a total of $2.1 billion from investors, according to Coinschedule, a website that tracks the activity.   I.C.O. fever has even infected celebrities. This month, the actress Paris Hilton tweeted that she was ''looking forward to participating'' in the initial coin offering of LydianCoin, a cryptocurrency project associated with the digital advertising company Gravity4. The boxing star Floyd Mayweather and the rapper the Game have also endorsed coin offerings.   Unlike traditional stock offerings, which are carefully supervised and planned months or years in advance, I.C.O.s are largely unregulated in the United States, although that could soon change. The Securities and Exchange Commission warned investors this year about the growing number of coin offerings, saying that ''fraudsters often try to use the lure of new and emerging technologies to convince potential victims to invest their money in scams.''   Mr. Palmer predicts that while some I.C.O.s may finance the creation of new and exciting enterprises, many will go up in smoke. He sees echoes of the first dot-com boom, when investors poured money into new and risky ventures only to get burned when the market came to its senses.   ''People are treating cryptocurrency now like penny stocks,'' he said. ''It's become a securities market.''   Other high-profile skeptics have sounded the alarm about a potential crash in the crypto market, including Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who last week called Bitcoin a ''fraud,'' and compared the current digital money craze to the 17th-century Dutch tulip bubble. And even true cryptocurrency believers have started to worry that I.C.O. mania won't end well.   ''It's a ticking time bomb,'' Charles Hoskinson, one of the developers of the cryptocurrency Ethereum, told Bloomberg in July.   When Mr. Palmer's interest in digital money began, just four years ago, cryptocurrency was the sole province of math geeks and early adopters.   ''It was fun, nobody took it seriously,'' he recalled. ''People threw it around like change because it wasn't worth anything.''   Unlike Bitcoin, whose early adopters often used it to buy drugs, weapons, or other illicit goods on the dark web, Dogecoin attracted a crowd of earnest do-gooders at first. They even set up a philanthropic arm, called the Dogecoin Foundation, and used it to raise thousands of dollars for projects, including sponsoring service dogs for autistic children and drilling water wells in Kenya. (Their generosity extended to quirkier projects; when Dogecoin fans heard that Jamaica's two-man bobsled team had qualified for the Winter Olympics in Sochi but lacked the money to get to Russia, they pitched in $30,000 to fund the trip.)   As the price of Bitcoin climbed, investors got interested in other cryptocurrencies. With no explanation, the price of Dogecoin doubled, then tripled. Two months after it was introduced, Mr. Palmer's joke was worth $50 million, and some early Dogecoin adopters, who called themselves ''shibes,'' were sitting on lucrative stockpiles.   The success of Dogecoin attracted unsavory characters. One scammer raised $750,000 from Dogecoin supporters for a cryptocurrency start-up that never materialized. A hacker broke into Dogewallet, a website where users stored their coins, and stole thousands of dollars worth of the currency. Soon, the Dogecoin Reddit forum was full of angry scam victims and get-rich-quick schemers, and the once tight-knit Dogecoin community started to disintegrate.   ''We tried to do everything right,'' said Ben Doernberg, a former board member of the Dogecoin Foundation. ''But when you have a situation where people stand to put in a dollar and take out a thousand dollars, people lose their minds.''   Mr. Palmer, a laid-back Australian who works as a product manager in the Bay Area and describes himself as ''socialist leaning,'' was disturbed by the commercialization of his joke currency. He had never collected Dogecoin for himself, and had resisted efforts to cash in on the currency's success, even turning down a $500,000 investment offer from an Australian venture capital firm.   In 2015, he announced he was leaving Dogecoin behind, telling an interviewer that the cryptocurrency market ''increasingly feels like a bunch of white libertarian bros sitting around hoping to get rich and coming up with half-baked, buzzword-filled business ideas.''   He recently began making a series of YouTube videos that explain tech topics to beginners, including how digital currencies work. His goal? To rekindle people's excitement in the core blockchain technology, while tamping down some of the excessive hype.   ''My mission in all of this is to help people better understand things, rather than just thinking about profit,'' he said.   It may be too late for that. Regulators in the United States have begun to scrutinize I.C.O.s, and China's central bank went as far as issuing a temporary ban on new coin offerings. But more dollars are still pouring into cryptocurrency ventures every day, as giddy investors ignore the warning signs and look to multiply their money.   Mr. Palmer worries that the coming reckoning in the cryptocurrency market -- and it is coming, he says confidently -- will deter people from using the technology for more legitimate projects.   ''The bigger this bubble goes, the bigger negative connotation it's going to have,'' he said. ''It's going to be like the dot-com bust, but on a much more epic scale.''

Study Finds Vulnerability in Wide Range of Devices,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A security loophole that would allow someone to add extra steps to the counter on your Fitbit monitor might seem harmless. But researchers say it points to the broader risks that come with technology's embedding into the nooks of our lives. On Tuesday, a group of computer security researchers at the University of Michigan and the University of South Carolina will demonstrate that they have found a vulnerability that allows them to take control of or surreptitiously influence devices through the tiny accelerometers that are standard components in consumer products like smartphones, fitness monitors and even automobiles.     In their paper, the researchers describe how they added fake steps to a Fitbit fitness monitor and played a ''malicious'' music file from the speaker of a smartphone to control the phone's accelerometer. That allowed them to interfere with software that relies on the smartphone, like an app used to pilot a radio-controlled toy car.   ''It's like the opera singer who hits the note to break a wine glass, only in our case, we can spell out words'' and enter commands rather than just shut down the phone, said Kevin Fu, an author of the paper, who is also an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan and the chief executive of Virta Labs, a company that focuses on cybersecurity in health care. ''You can think of it as a musical virus.''   The flaw, which the researchers found in more than half of the 20 commercial brands from five chip makers they tested, illustrates the security challenges that have emerged as robots and other kinds of digital appliances have begun to move around in the world.   With dozens of start-ups and large transportation companies pushing to develop self-driving cars and trucks, undetected vulnerabilities that might allow an attacker to remotely control vehicles are an unnerving possibility.   Still, computer security researchers said the discovery was not a sky-is-falling bug but rather a revealing window into the cybersecurity challenges inherent in complex systems in which analog and digital components can interact in unexpected ways.   ''The whole world of security is about unintended interactions,'' said Paul Kocher, a cryptographer and a former executive at the chip company Rambus.   Accelerometers are instruments that measure acceleration and are frequently manufactured as silicon chip-based devices known as microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS. Accelerometers are used for navigating, for determining the orientation of a tablet computer and for measuring distance traveled in fitness monitors such as Fitbits.   In the case of the toy car, the researchers did not actually compromise the car's microprocessor, but they controlled the car by forcing the accelerometer to produce false readings. They exploited the fact that a smartphone application relies on the accelerometer to control the car.   While toy cars might seem like trivial examples, there are other, darker possibilities. If an accelerometer was designed to control the automation of insulin dosage in a diabetic patient, for example, that might make it possible to tamper with the system that controlled the correct dosage.   Dr. Fu has researched the cybersecurity risks of medical devices, including a demonstration of the potential to wirelessly introduce fatal heart rhythms into a pacemaker.   He said the current research was inspired by a discussion in his group about a previous study in which drones were disabled with music. He added that earlier research demonstrated denial-of-service attacks that used sound to disable accelerometers.   In 2014, security researchers at Stanford University demonstrated how an accelerometer could be used surreptitiously as a rudimentary microphone, for example. And in 2011, a group from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Georgia Institute of Technology demonstrated the use of an accelerometer in a smartphone to decode roughly 80 percent of the words being typed on a nearby computer keyboard by capturing vibrations from the keyboard.   In the case of the research by the University of Michigan and the University of South Carolina, scientists stopped the accelerometer from functioning and changed its behavior.   In testing 20 accelerometer models from five manufacturers, they affected the information or output from 75 percent of the devices tested and controlled the output in 65 percent of the devices.   The Department of Homeland Security was expected to issue a security advisory alert Tuesday for chips produced by the semiconductor companies documented in the paper, Dr. Fu said. The five chip makers were Analog Devices, Bosch, InvenSense, Murata Manufacturing and STMicroelectronics.   The paper, which will be presented at the IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy in Paris next month, also documents hardware and software changes manufacturers could make to protect against the flaws the researchers discovered.

Tunneling Though the Internet on Vacation,"Q. What do you think about virtual private networks? Do they really work to keep your information secure? I'm going on vacation to Alaska and I bought a VPN package, but I'm still not sure if it's O.K. for me to check my bank account or use the Wi-Fi in Starbucks.   A. Virtual private networks (also known as VPNs) are designed to shield personal information going back and forth over your internet connection by creating an encrypted ''tunnel'' for the data to pass through between your computer (or device) and the VPN server. If you do not have a secure connection -- especially on a public wireless network that anyone could use -- online intruders could potentially spy on the websites you visit and even steal passwords and other credentials you enter. Using a VPN while connected to any unprotected public access network is generally advised for information safety.    Reputable VPN services from a trusted company let you bring your own security to unsecure networks; F-Secure's Freedome VPN, Private Internet Access and TunnelBear are among the apps with generally positive reviews. Not all VPN services are the same, though, and some may be weaker than others.   Certain apps may offer ad-blocking or location-hiding, so if you decide to permanently add a VPN app to your system, make sure it does what you want. You should also read the company's privacy policy to see how it intends to use the data it gets from you while you use the service.   Browsing the web over a VPN can be slow, and not all online services work through the connection. For travelers, using a virtual private network on a cruise ship -- which typically uses a satellite internet connection at sea -- can be frustrating because some cruise lines do not support VPN services or allow only certain types of connections. Banking sites tend to have their own security, and using a VPN connection may require you to re-enter your bank login credentials.

"Angela Merkel, Russia's Next Target; Contributing Op-Ed Writer","HAMBURG, Germany - It's no surprise that Russia met President Obama's expulsion of its diplomats, which he announced Thursday in response to the Kremlin's efforts to manipulate the 2016 election, with a collective shrug. Moscow seems content to let the clock run out, knowing that on Jan. 20 Mr. Obama will be replaced by an admirer in the White House and an old friend in the State Department. But the changeover is bittersweet; President Vladimir V. Putin has also lost a beloved boogeyman. For the foreseeable future, the United States can hardly serve as Russia's preferred enemy of the state. So guess who qualifies best as a new, well, boogeywoman? Angela Merkel.  The German chancellor is a perfect target. Germany is holding general elections next autumn, and with politicians sympathetic to Moscow on the rise, she may well be running for her fourth term as the sole European leader willing to stand up to a newly assertive Russia. Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ms. Merkel has been the most consequential voice for punishing Russia. The next year, she welcomed a million refugees into Germany, and pushed the rest of Europe to do the same - thus, in the view of Russian ethno-nationalists, diluting European culture. And she still believes in a united, integrated European Union, a bastion of liberal values and, at least implicitly, a political and economic bulwark against Russia. It seems that Russia may be planning to do to Ms. Merkel and her allies in 2017 what it did to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats in the United States in 2016. After all, last year the same hackers who broke into the Democratic Party's computers, known online as Fancy Bear or Sofacy Group, attacked the German Parliament's network; they are also accused of stealing documents from individual members of Parliament. Every revelation about how Russia interfered in the American elections gives Germany a foretaste of what is already looking to be the nastiest, toughest, most exhausting election campaign in modern German history. That foretaste, though, is also Germany's one advantage. We know something about Russians' technical abilities and methods, and, even more important, we have a developing sense of where they're coming from ideologically - and how that will guide their attacks. Here, we can draw valuable lessons from the Cold War. What Russia does today is very much the digital version of what we Germans, before 1989, termed ""Zersetzung."" The term is hard to translate, but it's best described as the political equivalent of what happens when you pour acid on organic material: dissolution and disintegration. The methods of Zersetzung are to cast doubt on the basic norms of the Western liberal order and its institutions; to distort and thereby discredit the purposes of the European Union, NATO and the free-market economy; to erode the credibility of the free press and free elections. The means of Zersetzung include character assassination and, through the spreading of lies and fake news, the creation of a gray zone of doubt in which facts struggle to survive. We have seen all of this before, employed by the K.G.B. and the East German Stasi: psychological warfare, rumor-mongering, schemes to bribe politicians and then expose them as criminals. They used it both internally, against dissidents, and externally, against Western enemies. Mr. Putin and his former K.G.B. colleagues should know that, this time, we have a better sense of their dirty tricks, and how they have updated Zersetzung for the internet. The government has its role to play, but so do journalists and civil-society groups. We journalists will put pressure on companies like Facebook and Twitter to be vigilant against fake news; we will expose the patterns of Russian agitprop where we see them. But it is just as important to be clear about the ideology driving these attacks. In September, my newspaper, Die Zeit, joined with the broadcaster ZDF to reveal details of Moscow's highly sophisticated disinformation campaign. We had gained access to roughly 10,000 emails that showed how ideologues close to the Putin administration advised the pro-Russian rebel government in Eastern Ukraine. Among the emails was a document that set ""thematic guidelines"" which rebel-allied media outlets had to follow - if necessary by distorting facts and faking news. ""Today's Russia is no longer the Russia of the 1990s, but is working unwaveringly to re-establish the strength of the Soviet Union. Today's Russia is on an equal footing with the West,"" it read. ""A global diplomatic war is underway. But the West is also suffering in this war, and it is still unclear who will prevail."" No doubt similar marching orders have been given to the armies of hackers who were sent to attack the Democrats, and who are now plotting attacks on Germany. It is quite clear who will lose. Mr. Putin and his reckless fakers should be aware that the only thing they will harvest from this mendacity is another lost generation of Russians who could serve their country better by being given the opportunity for honest and constructive intellectual challenges. A government that maligns the outside world to make feel Russia great again is doomed to fail - as it failed before.

Apple's Silence in China Sets Dangerous Precedent,"Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo A year ago, the Federal Bureau of Investigation made an extraordinary demand of Apple. To get inside a dead terrorist's iPhone, law enforcement officials wanted the company to create a hackable version of the software that runs all iPhones. To many legal experts, it wasn't obvious that Apple had a winning case against the request. But facing great legal and political opposition, Apple took a stand anyway. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, argued that the company had a financial and moral duty to protect its users' privacy and security. He made clear that Apple would obey American law -- but only after trying to shape the law.     The fight paid off. On the eve of a courtroom showdown, the F.B.I. rescinded its request. It is worth underlining this point: When Apple took a public stand for its users' liberty and privacy, the American government blinked.   Yet in China over the weekend, when faced with a broad demand by the Chinese internet authority, it was Apple that blinked.   Apple pulled down several VPN apps -- programs that allow iPhone users to bypass the Chinese government's censorship apparatus -- from its Chinese App Store. The developers behind the apps must register with the government under a cybersecurity law that went into effect in January. The law imposes criminal penalties on Apple and other companies that host unregistered apps.   Whatever Apple may have done in private to fight the Chinese internet law, the company has not offered a peep of criticism in public. Apple's only public statement on the VPN ban said that the company had been ''required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,'' but noted that the ''apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.'' Despite the pulldown, Apple says there are still hundreds of VPN apps available on its Chinese app store, some of which remain unregistered with the government.   Search Apple's website for a letter from Mr. Cook issuing a public rebuke of China's intrusion into his customers' privacy and freedom of expression -- you won't find it. The company has not fully tested its political and economic leverage in China. It hasn't tested the public's immense love of its products. It hasn't publicly threatened any long-term consequences -- like looking to other parts of the world to manufacture its products.   The company's silence may be tactical; the Chinese government, the conventional thinking goes, does not take well to public rebuke. Yet Apple's quiet capitulation to tightening censorship in one of its largest markets is still a dangerous precedent.   ''Apple's response is tremendously disappointing,'' said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy group. ''I think it's possible that Apple is playing a bigger role behind the scenes here. But the problem with that is, from the outside it looks exactly like doing nothing.''   This isn't just a blow for the liberties of Apple's customers in China. Authoritarian governments have a tendency to copy what works. Russia just passed a law curbing VPNs. Early this year, Apple pulled down The New York Times app in the Chinese App Store, and both Apple and Google removed the LinkedIn app from their Russian app stores. In the United States, President Trump has called for greater legal measures against the press. And he took the F.B.I.'s side in that fight over iPhones. What happens in China doesn't stay in China.   It may be naïve to expect Apple to publicly take on the Chinese government. Sure, it may be the world's most valuable company, with extensive investments and operations in China. But Apple is also just a foreign company -- it must obey local laws, and it must watch for its bottom line. The Chinese market accounts for a quarter of Apple's sales, and many analysts see the region as a key growth area for the company. So what was Apple supposed to do? Jeopardize its operations over a few apps?   What's more, Apple's silence isn't unusual. While American tech companies frequently criticize decisions by American officials, they appear loath to do so in China. This weekend, Amazon also began banning VPN services from the Chinese version of its cloud-computing platform, called AWS. Facebook, has been exploring ways of getting into the Chinese government's good graces. Google pulled many of its services out of the Chinese market in 2010, blaming censorship, but it has lately been mulling ways to get back.   There is also a moral defense of Apple's decision to give in without a public fight: Despite the VPN ban, Chinese internet users might still be better off with Apple in China than with it outside. Its app store still provides people access to millions of apps that they might not find elsewhere in China. And Apple's own communications apps in China remain free of government censorship. For instance, Messages, Apple's texting app, and FaceTime, its video and phone-calling app, are protected by end-to-end encryption, allowing Chinese users to communicate freely.   But that may be of limited utility.   ''It will only get worse,'' said Xiao Qiang, a Chinese human rights activist and an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. Mr. Xiao sees the latest crackdowns as the beginning of a new wave of internet censorship in China. And he doesn't buy the argument that saying something publicly would have backfired for Apple.   ''They should say something,'' he said. ''They are a U.S. company, after all. And they're a global company, upholding standards of privacy and speech in many, many markets outside China. So if they have to do things differently in China, they should have some public explanation for why -- because that attitude could matter globally, including in the U.S.''     "
Czechs Suspect a Foreign Power in Email Hacking,"PRAGUE -- A ''statelike actor'' infiltrated the Czech Foreign Ministry and hacked emails belonging to the foreign minister and dozens of his colleagues, in a manner similar to the  breach of the Democratic National Committee's servers, the minister announced on Tuesday. The announcement immediately raised fears across Central Europe of potential interference by Russia, which the United States government said was behind the attack on the D.N.C. That breach resulted in embarrassing leaks ahead of Donald J. Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in the United States presidential election. Legislative elections are expected to be held in October -- another unnerving resemblance to the D.N.C. hack.     The attack in the Czech Republic occurred repeatedly and was detected only during a recent systems check, officials said.   The foreign minister, Lubomir Zaoralek, said at a news briefing in Prague that no classified information had been compromised and that the government uses a separate internal server to exchange confidential information. There have been previous hacking attempts at the ministry, but none succeeded.   However, a report at the online news site Neovlivni said highly sensitive messages had been downloaded, and described the breach as one of the most serious in years. Experts agreed that the government had probably played down the scope of the attack.   ''No matter how great the leak is, a respected institution will not admit it, because it is its failure,'' Karel Randak, a former head of foreign relations in the Czech foreign intelligence service, said.   Mr. Zaoralek, at the news conference, said, ''The attack was very sophisticated and probably carried out by a statelike actor,'' though he declined to specify which country might be behind it. He said the attack resembled that carried out against the D.N.C., but he did not provide details.   Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka called the hacking a serious threat to national security and ordered a thorough analysis into what had happened. ''The issue has to be thoroughly investigated,'' he said.   Mr. Sobotka has had his own encounters with security breaches. His private email account was hacked in January 2016; about 80 emails were stolen and posted on an extremist white supremacy website. A month earlier, his Twitter account had been hacked and flooded with racist comments. (Experts said that somebody had simply guessed the password and that the attack was not the result of a coordinated or elaborate operation.)   The target suggested that the hacking was aimed at collecting sensitive information about other countries, not just the Czech Republic, said Michal Salat, threat intelligence director at Avast, a computer security company.   ''Regardless of the quality of information that was hacked, political institutions should properly protect all of their accounts, as data leaks always lead to a loss in trust,'' Mr. Salat said. ''That it was the Czech foreign minister that was hacked suggests that the attackers were eager to access information regarding other countries.''   Czech government institutions have faced a growing number of hacking attempts, according to Daniel P. Bagge, director of cybersecurity policy at the Czech National Security Bureau.   In October, the Czech police detained a 29-year-old Russian, Yevgeniy Aleksandrovich Nikulin, on accusations of hacking. He was indicted by a federal grand jury in California on charges that he hacked into computer networks at LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring, damaged computers and conspired to traffic in stolen information. Both the Russian and American authorities have requested his extradition; he remains in custody in Prague.   ''The information security threat from both governmental and nongovernmental groups is most likely substantially much higher than perceived,'' said Kyrre Sletsjoe, the owner of Cepia Technologies, a company in the Czech city of Brno that does computing work for governments. ''I am convinced that the majority of these attacks are never discovered.''     "
"A Cyberattack Hits Ukraine, Then Spreads","Computer systems from Ukraine to the United States were struck on Tuesday in an international cyberattack that was similar to a recent assault that crippled tens of thousands of machines worldwide. In Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, A.T.M.s stopped working. About 80 miles away, workers were forced to manually monitor radiation at the old Chernobyl nuclear plant when their computers failed. And tech managers at companies around the world -- from Maersk, the Danish shipping conglomerate, to Merck, the drug giant in the United States -- were scrambling to respond. Even an Australian factory for the chocolate giant Cadbury was affected.    It was unclear who was behind this cyberattack, and the extent of its impact was still hard to gauge Tuesday. It started as an attack on Ukrainian government and business computer systems -- an assault that appeared to have been intended to hit the day before a holiday marking the adoption in 1996 of Ukraine's first Constitution after its break from the Soviet Union. The attack spread from there, causing collateral damage around the world.   The outbreak was the latest and perhaps the most sophisticated in a series of attacks making use of dozens of hacking tools that were stolen from the National Security Agency and leaked online in April by a group called the Shadow Brokers.    Like the WannaCry attacks in May, the latest global hacking took control of computers and demanded digital ransom from their owners to regain access. The new attack used the same National Security Agency hacking tool, Eternal Blue, that was used in the WannaCry episode, as well as two other methods to promote its spread, according to researchers at the computer security company Symantec.   The National Security Agency has not acknowledged its tools were used in WannaCry or other attacks. But computer security specialists are demanding that the agency help the rest of the world defend against the weapons it created.   ''The N.S.A. needs to take a leadership role in working closely with security and operating system platform vendors such as Apple and Microsoft to address the plague that they've unleashed,'' said Golan Ben-Oni, the global chief information officer at IDT, a Newark-based conglomerate hit by a separate attack in April that used the agency's hacking tools. Mr. Ben-Oni warned federal officials that more serious attacks were probably on the horizon.   The vulnerability in Windows software used by Eternal Blue was patched by Microsoft in March, but as the WannaCry attacks demonstrated, hundreds of thousands of groups around the world failed to properly install the fix.   ''Just because you roll out a patch doesn't mean it'll be put in place quickly,'' said Carl Herberger, vice president for security at Radware. ''The more bureaucratic an organization is, the higher chance it won't have updated its software.''   Because the ransomware used at least two other ways to spread on Tuesday -- including stealing victims' credentials -- even those who used the Microsoft patch could be vulnerable and potential targets for later attacks, according to researchers at F-Secure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm, and others.   A Microsoft spokesman said the company's latest antivirus software should protect against the attack.   The Ukrainian government said several of its ministries, local banks and metro systems had been affected. A number of other European companies, including Rosneft, the Russian energy giant; Saint-Gobain, the French construction materials company; and WPP, the British advertising agency, also said they had been targeted.   Ukrainian officials pointed a finger at Russia on Tuesday, although Russian companies were also affected. Home Credit bank, one of Russia's top 50 lenders, was paralyzed, with all of its offices closed, according to the RBC news website. The attack also affected Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company that employs about 80,000 people, the RBC website reported.   In the United States, the multinational law firm DLA Piper also reported being hit. Hospitals in Pennsylvania were being forced to cancel operations after the attack hit computers at Heritage Valley Health Systems, a Pennsylvania health care provider, and its hospitals in Beaver and Sewickley, Penn., and satellite locations across the state.   The ransomware also hurt Australian branches of international companies. DLA Piper's Australian offices warned clients that they were dealing with a ''serious global cyber incident'' and had disabled email as a precautionary measure. Local news reports said that in Hobart, Tasmania, on Tuesday evening, computers in a Cadbury chocolate factory, owned by Mondelez International, had displayed ransomware messages that demanded $300 in bitcoins.   Qantas Airways' booking system failed for a time on Tuesday, but the company said the breakdown was due to an unrelated hardware issue.   The Australian government has urged companies to install security updates and isolate any infected computers from their networks.   ''This ransomware attack is a wake-up call to all Australian businesses to regularly back up their data and install the latest security patches,'' said Dan Tehan, the cybersecurity minister. ''We are aware of the situation and monitoring it closely.''   A National Security Agency spokesman referred questions about the attack to the Department of Homeland Security. ''The Department of Homeland Security is monitoring reports of cyberattacks affecting multiple global entities and is coordinating with our international and domestic cyber partners,'' Scott McConnell, a department spokesman, said in a statement.   Computer specialists said the ransomware was very similar to a virus that emerged last year called Petya. Petya means ''Little Peter,'' in Russian, leading some to speculate the name referred to Sergei Prokofiev's 1936 symphony ''Peter and the Wolf,'' about a boy who captures a wolf.   Reports that the computer virus was a variant of Petya suggest the attackers will be hard to trace. Petya was for sale on the so-called dark web, where its creators made the ransomware available as ''ransomware as a service'' -- a play on Silicon Valley terminology for delivering software over the internet, according to the security firm Avast Threat Labs.   That means anyone could launch the ransomware with the click of a button, encrypt someone's systems and demand a ransom to unlock it. If the victim pays, the authors of the Petya ransomware, who call themselves Janus Cybercrime Solutions, get a cut of the payment.   That distribution method means that pinning down the people responsible for Tuesday's attack could be difficult.   The attack is ''an improved and more lethal version of WannaCry,'' said Matthieu Suiche, a security researcher who helped contain the spread of the WannaCry ransomware when he created a kill switch that stopped the attacks.   In just the last seven days, Mr. Suiche noted, WannaCry had tried to hit an additional 80,000 organizations but was prevented from executing attack code because of the kill switch. Petya does not have a kill switch.   Petya also encrypts and locks entire hard drives, whereas the earlier ransomware attacks locked only individual files, said Chris Hinkley, a researcher at the security firm Armor.   The hackers behind Petya demanded $300 worth of the cybercurrency Bitcoin to unlock victims' machines. By Tuesday afternoon, online records showed that 30 victims had paid the ransom, although it was not clear whether they had regained access to their files. Other victims may be out of luck, after Posteo, the German email service provider, shut down the hackers' email account.   In Ukraine, people turned up at post offices, A.T.M.s and airports to find blank computer screens, or signs about closures. At Kiev's central post office, a few bewildered customers milled about, holding parcels and letters, looking at a sign that said, ''Closed for technical reasons.''   The hackers compromised Ukrainian accounting software mandated to be used in various industries in the country, including government agencies and banks, according to researchers at Cisco Talos, the security division of the computer networking company. That allowed them to unleash their ransomware when the software, which is also used in other countries, was updated.   The ransomware spread for five days across Ukraine, and around the world, before activating Tuesday evening.   ''If I had to guess, I would think this was done to send a political message,'' said Craig Williams, the senior technical researcher at Talos.   One Kiev resident, Tetiana Vasylieva, was forced to borrow money from a relative after failing to withdraw money at four automated teller machines. At one A.T.M. in Kiev belonging to the Ukrainian branch of the Austrian bank Raiffeisen, a message on the screen said the machine was not functioning.   Ukraine's Infrastructure Ministry, the postal service, the national railway company, and one of the country's largest communications companies, Ukrtelecom, had been affected, Volodymyr Omelyan, the country's infrastructure minister, said in a Facebook post.   Officials for the metro system in Kiev said card payments could not be accepted. The national power grid company Kievenergo had to switch off all of its computers, but the situation was under control, according to the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. Metro Group, a German company that runs wholesale food stores, said its operations in Ukraine had been affected.   At the Chernobyl plant, the computers affected by the attack collected data on radiation levels and were not connected to industrial systems at the site, where, although all reactors have been decommissioned, huge volumes of radioactive waste remain. Operators said radiation monitoring was being done manually.   Cybersecurity researchers questioned whether collecting ransom was the true objective of the attack.   ''It's entirely possible that this attack could have been a smoke screen,'' said Justin Harvey, the managing director of global incident response at Accenture Security. ''If you are an evildoer and you wanted to cause mayhem, why wouldn't you try to first mask it as something else?''     "
Malware Case Is Major Blow For the N.S.A.,"WASHINGTON -- Since August, when a mysterious group calling itself the Shadow Brokers announced that it was auctioning off highly classified National Security Agency hacking tools, a low-grade panic has seized the nation's largest intelligence agency. In April, when the Shadow Brokers dumped dozens of the agency's software exploits on the web, free to criminals and foreign spies alike, the clock began ticking toward inevitable calamity. And since Friday, the agency has watched as malicious software based on its creations spread across the world, shutting down hospitals, disrupting rail traffic and spurring frustration and chaos in some 150 countries.    ''For half a century, N.S.A. pried into other people's secrets,'' said Amy B. Zegart, a Stanford University professor who studies intelligence agencies. ''Now they're suddenly sitting ducks who have their secrets stolen and used around the world.''    The weekend's ransomware attack is only the latest in a series of trials for the agency. In 2005, the revelation by The New York Times that the National Security Agency was eavesdropping inside the United States without court orders set off a yearslong debate over American privacy and led to new legal limits on surveillance. In 2013, Edward J. Snowden gave journalists hundreds of thousands of N.S.A. documents he had taken as a contractor, igniting a global debate over the agency's targeting of allies as well as foes. Last August, shortly after the Shadow Brokers' debut, a veteran intelligence contractor named Harold T. Martin III was  charged with walking out of the National Security Agency and other agencies with a staggering 50 terabytes of confidential data.   Michael V. Hayden, the director of the National Security Agency from 1999 to 2005, said he had defended it for years in debates over civil liberties. ''But I cannot defend an agency having powerful tools if it cannot protect the tools and keep them in its own hands,'' he said. He said the loss of the so-called malware, and the damage it has caused, ''poses a very serious threat to the future of the agency.''   The latest nightmare for the agency, which is responsible for eavesdropping, code breaking and cyberespionage, appears to be far from over. Early Tuesday, a post purportedly from the Shadow Brokers announced that it was starting a sort of hack-of-the-month club.   ''TheShadowBrokers is launching new monthly subscription model,'' said the post, in the faux broken English that the group has repeatedly used in public statements. ''Is being like wine of month club. Each month peoples can be paying membership fee, then getting members only data dump each month. What members doing with data after is up to members.''   The mocking tone -- the post's title, ''OH LORDY! Comey Wanna Cry Edition,'' referred to President Trump's firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, and the ransomware known as WannaCry -- could not disguise the deadly serious nature of the threat. Software experts said that the group's dump of N.S.A. tools in April included additional exploits that are ''wormable'' -- meaning they could spread rapidly, like the ransomware attack -- and that it might well have more N.S.A. malware it has not yet released.   In an especially painful development for the agency, some specialists detected evidence that North Korea might have carried out the attack, meaning an adversary had turned American weapons against American allies and innocent parties. From British hospitals to an Army base in Arizona, older computers using Microsoft Windows locked up, with a demand of $300 or more to unlock the files on each machine. (The National Security Agency did not respond to a request for comment.)   Michael Sulmeyer, a former top Pentagon policy official who now runs the cybersecurity program at Harvard's Kennedy School, said the Shadow Brokers episode was a ''disaster'' for the National Security Agency that underscored how the stakes of leaks from the agency had changed.   ''Ten years ago, the costs were fairly low for things going wrong at N.S.A.,'' Mr. Sulmeyer said. Then, he said, leaks could cut off important sources of intelligence, but today the agency wields powerful malicious software. ''Now,'' he said, ''there's a risk for public safety.''   The agency has spent hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars to develop an arsenal of stealthy software tools to break into foreign computer networks and gather intelligence. When it lost control of those exploits, it was a less lethal version of the Air Force awakening one morning to find many fighter jets missing -- and then learning that the fighters were randomly strafing cities around the globe.   The Shadow Brokers saga began in mid-August with a cryptic announcement on Pastebin.com of an online auction of hacking tools taken from what the post called the Equation Group, a tech industry name for the National Security Agency's hacking division, officially called Tailored Access Operations. A few samples were listed to encourage bids.   ''We auction best files to highest bidder,'' the note said.   The announcement created a scramble in the intelligence world to assess the damage and to find the source. There were at least three theories: that Russian hackers had somehow swiped the tools from the agency or a contractor; that N.S.A. operators had inadvertently left them unguarded on a ''staging server'' used to conduct espionage; or that a disgruntled insider had leaked or sold the malware.   The last scenario -- an insider leak from among the 35,000 N.S.A. employees and thousands more contractors -- is now in the lead, officials say. About the time the leak hunt began, the F.B.I. arrested Mr. Martin, a veteran intelligence contractor who had worked at the National Security Agency, including in its Tailored Access Operations unit. An N.S.A. employee was arrested in 2015 but never identified, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. That employee's possible role in leaks remains unclear.   Mr. Martin was not charged with sharing the tools. It is uncertain what charges have been filed against the second person.   The Shadow Brokers found few bidders for their stolen wares. They offered a few more announcements, including screenshots of computer code, without stirring up sales.   Then, in March, apparently after being tipped off by the National Security Agency, Microsoft offered customers a patch that would protect against some of the N.S.A. exploits. Fearing that the window for using the stolen malware was closing, on April 14, the Shadow Brokers simply dumped a list of dozens of the N.S.A. files on github.com, a site for programmers. The group gave the password to find the malware on a cloud site, Yandex Disk, and issued an announcement on steemit.com.   ''Is being too bad nobody deciding to be paying theshadowbrokers for just to shutup and going away,'' the notice said. ''TheShadowBrokers rather being getting drunk with McAfee,'' an apparent reference to the antivirus company, ''on desert island with hot babes.''   When he saw the files, Sven Dietrich, who teaches computer security at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, told his class that it was only a matter of time before the escaped N.S.A. malware began doing damage.   ''It's too tempting to have nation-state level exploits available for free on the web,'' he said.   BinaryEdge, a Zurich cybersecurity company, began picking up machines around the world infected with an N.S.A. exploit called DoublePulsar. The total reached 106,000 on April 21; 244,000 on April 25; 429,000 on April 27.   ''It was a prewarning of what was to come,'' said Tiago Henriques, the chief executive of BinaryEdge. Using another exploit, called EternalBlue, attackers began targeting vulnerable machines with a self-replicating software ''worm'' that locked files and posted a ransom demand.   Even the April release of N.S.A. exploits is not close to exhausted, according to several cyberspecialists. On the underground dark web, they said, another N.S.A. tool has been weaponized and offered for sale, and hackers are discussing how to use another dozen agency exploits.   But Mr. Henriques did have a kind of compliment for the work of the National Security Agency, now under siege.   ''These tools were beautifully made,'' he said. ''Hard to detect and easy to use. They were pretty much point and shoot. Even under the circumstances, you have to appreciate good engineering.''

Daily Report: Evidence Points to North Korea in Ransomware Attack,"It didn't take long for researchers to start drawing connections from the ransomware attack that raced around the world over the last five days to earlier episodes, including attacks on Polish banks and the assault on Sony Pictures in 2014.  The common thread, according to the researchers? North Korea.    North Korea takes its hacking seriously. Students are selected at an early age for their aptitude and are groomed for the work, similar to the way young athletes or musicians are cultivated in other nations. The students are often educated in other countries, where they frequently work in legitimate jobs.   On command, these sleeper cells activate and hit their targets.   Placing its hackers in other countries acts as a sort of advanced war planning for North Korea. If the country should enter a conflict, the hackers can be called to attack opponents' computer networks. And if China were to cut off North Korea's limited internet access, the hackers would still be able to do their work.   China, one of North Korea's few trading partners and its chief enabler, was among the worst hit by the ransomware attack. If the links from the global ransomware attack are confirmed, researchers will be watching for retribution.     "
Gearing Up for Another Windows 10 Update,"Q. With all the concern about Microsoft Paint going away in the next Windows 10 update, I almost missed that there's yet another update to Windows 10 coming out this year. When is this one supposed to arrive, and what will it do?  A. Microsoft Paint, the free graphics software that has been included with the Windows operating system for 32 years, is not going away entirely, but Microsoft did announce that it was ceasing any future development of the program. In a company blog post, Microsoft said that the old version of Paint would be available in the Windows Store as an optional download, even if it would no longer be included in future versions of Windows.    While the company has retirement plans for the old Paint, its newer Paint 3D app (released earlier this year with the Windows 10 Creators Update) includes many of the same drawing, painting and visual tools -- and as the name suggests, refreshes the app with 3-D drawing and modeling features. The Windows blog has tips and video tutorials for those who want to explore Paint 3D.   As for the next version of Windows 10, Microsoft is calling it the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and plans to release it next month, but has yet to reveal an exact arrival date. New additions include Timeline (a visual record of your sessions on the computer that makes it easy to jump back into a project) and Story Remix (a moviemaking app that automatically creates videos from your clips). Many other features are expected in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, including a redesign of the Action Center for system settings and notifications, enhancements to the Cortana virtual assistant and built-in protection from ransomware attacks.

North Korea Deploys Corps Of Hackers Bent on Chaos,"When North Korean hackers tried to steal $1 billion from the New York Federal Reserve last year, only a spelling error stopped them. They were digitally looting an account of the Bangladesh Central Bank, when bankers grew suspicious about a withdrawal request that had misspelled ''foundation'' as ''fandation.'' Even so, Kim Jong-un's minions still got away with $81 million in that heist.    Then only sheer luck enabled a 22-year-old British hacker to defuse the biggest North Korean cyberattack to date, a ransomware attack last May that failed to generate much cash but brought down hundreds of thousands of computers across dozens of countries -- and briefly crippled Britain's National Health Service.    Their track record is mixed, but North Korea's army of more than 6,000 hackers is undeniably persistent, and undeniably improving, according to American and British security officials who have traced these attacks and others back to the North.   Amid all the attention on Pyongyang's progress in developing a nuclear weapon capable of striking the continental United States, the North Koreans have also quietly developed a cyberprogram that is  stealing hundreds of millions of dollars and proving capable of unleashing global havoc.   Unlike its weapons tests, which have led to international sanctions, the North's cyberstrikes have faced almost no pushback or punishment, even as the regime is already using its hacking capabilities for actual attacks against its adversaries in the West.   And just as Western analysts once scoffed at the potential of the North's nuclear program, so did experts dismiss its cyberpotential -- only to now acknowledge that hacking is an almost perfect weapon for a Pyongyang that is isolated and has little to lose.   The country's primitive infrastructure is far less vulnerable to cyberretaliation, and North Korean hackers operate outside the country, anyway. Sanctions offer no useful response, since a raft of sanctions are already imposed. And Mr. Kim's advisers are betting that no one will respond to a cyberattack with a military attack, for fear of a catastrophic escalation between North and South Korea.   ''Cyber is a tailor-made instrument of power for them,'' said Chris Inglis, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, who now directs cyberstudies at the United States Naval Academy. ''There's a low cost of entry, it's largely asymmetrical, there's some degree of anonymity and stealth in its use. It can hold large swaths of nation state infrastructure and private-sector infrastructure at risk. It's a source of income.''   Mr. Inglis, speaking at the Cambridge Cyber Summit this month, added: ''You could argue that they have one of the most successful cyberprograms on the planet, not because it's technically sophisticated, but because it has achieved all of their aims at very low cost.''   It is hardly a one-way conflict: By some measures the United States and North Korea have been engaged in an active cyberconflict for years.   Both the United States and South Korea have also placed digital ''implants'' in the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North Korean equivalent of the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents that Edward J. Snowden released several years ago. American-created cyber- and electronic warfare weapons were deployed to disable North Korean missiles, an attack that was, at best, only partially successful.   Indeed, both sides see cyber as the way to gain tactical advantage in their nuclear and missile standoff.   A South Korean lawmaker last week revealed that the North had successfully broken into the South's military networks to steal war plans, including for the ''decapitation'' of the North Korean leadership in the opening hours of a new Korean war.   There is evidence Pyongyang has planted so-called digital sleeper cells in the South's critical infrastructure, and its Defense Ministry, that could be activated to paralyze power supplies and military command and control networks.   But the North is not motivated solely by politics: Its most famous cyberattack came in 2014, against Sony Pictures Entertainment, in a largely successful effort to block the release of a movie that satirized Mr. Kim.   What has not been disclosed, until now, is that North Korea had also hacked into a British television network a few weeks earlier to stop it from broadcasting a drama about a nuclear scientist kidnapped in Pyongyang.   Once North Korea counterfeited crude $100 bills to try to generate hard cash. Now intelligence officials estimate that North Korea reaps hundreds of millions a dollars a year from ransomware, digital bank heists, online video game cracking, and more recently, hacks of South Korean Bitcoin exchanges.   One former British intelligence chief estimates the take from its cyberheists may bring the North as much as $1 billion a year, or a third of the value of the nation's exports.   The North Korean cyberthreat ''crept up on us,'' said Robert Hannigan, the former director of Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, which handles electronic surveillance and cybersecurity.   ''Because they are such a mix of the weird and absurd and medieval and highly sophisticated, people didn't take it seriously,'' he said. ''How can such an isolated, backward country have this capability? Well, how can such an isolated backward country have this nuclear ability?''   From Minor Leaguers to Serious Hackers   Kim Jong-il, the father of the current dictator and the initiator of North Korea's cyberoperations, was a movie lover who became an internet enthusiast, a luxury reserved for the country's elite. When Mr. Kim died in 2011, the country was estimated to have 1,024 IP addresses, fewer than on most New York City blocks.   Mr. Kim, like the Chinese, initially saw the internet as a threat to his regime's ironclad control over information. But his attitude began to change in the early 1990s, after a group of North Korean computer scientists returned from travel abroad proposing to use the web to spy on and attack enemies like the United States and South Korea, according to defectors.   North Korea began identifying promising students at an early age for special training, sending many to China's top computer science programs. In the late 1990s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's counterintelligence division noticed that North Koreans assigned to work at the United Nations were also quietly enrolling in university computer programming courses in New York.   ''The F.B.I. called me and said, 'What should we do?' '' recalled James A. Lewis, at the time in charge of cybersecurity at the Commerce Department. ''I told them, 'Don't do anything. Follow them and see what they are up to.'''   The North's cyberwarfare unit gained priority after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States. After watching the American ''shock and awe'' campaign on CNN, Kim Jong-il issued a warning to his military: ''If warfare was about bullets and oil until now,'' he told top commanders, according to a prominent defector, Kim Heung-kwang, ''warfare in the 21st century is about information.''   The unit was marked initially by mishaps and bluster.   ''There was an enormous growth in capability from 2009 or so, when they were a joke,'' said Ben Buchanan, the author of ''The Cybersecurity Dilemma'' and a fellow at the Cyber Security Project at Harvard. ''They would execute a very basic attack against a minor web page put up by the White House or an American intelligence agency, and then their sympathizers would claim they'd hacked the U.S. government. But since then, their hackers have gotten a lot better.''   A National Intelligence Estimate in 2009 wrote off the North's hacking prowess, much as it underestimated its long-range missile program. It would be years before it could mount a meaningful threat, it claimed.   But the regime was building that threat.   When Kim Jong-un succeeded his father, in 2011, he expanded the cybermission beyond serving as just a weapon of war, focusing also on theft, harassment and political-score settling.   ''Cyberwarfare, along with nuclear weapons and missiles, is an 'all-purpose sword' that guarantees our military's capability to strike relentlessly,'' Kim Jong-un reportedly declared, according to the testimony of a South Korean intelligence chief.   And the array of United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang only incentivized Mr. Kim's embrace.   ''We're already sanctioning anything and everything we can,'' said Robert P. Silvers, the former assistant secretary for cyberpolicy at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. ''They're already the most isolated nation in the world.''   By 2012, government officials and private researchers say North Korea had dispersed its hacking teams abroad, relying principally on China's internet infrastructure. This allowed the North to exploit largely nonsecure internet connections and maintain a degree of plausible deniability.   A recent analysis by the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future found heavy North Korean internet activity in India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nepal, Kenya, Mozambique, and Indonesia. In some cases, like that of New Zealand, North Korean hackers were simply routing their attacks through the country's computers from abroad. In others, researchers believe they are now physically stationed in countries like India, where nearly one-fifth of Pyongyang's cyberattacks now originate.   Intelligence agencies are now trying to track the North Korean hackers in these countries the way they have previously tracked terrorist sleeper cells or nuclear proliferators: looking for their favorite hotels, lurking in online forums they may inhabit, attempting to feed them bad computer code and counterattacking their own servers.   Learning From Iran, Growing Bolder   For decades Iran and North Korea have shared missile technology, and American intelligence agencies have long sought evidence of secret cooperation in the nuclear arena. In cyber, the Iranians taught the North Koreans something important: When confronting an enemy that has internet-connected banks, trading systems, oil and water pipelines, dams, hospitals, and entire cities, the opportunities to wreak havoc are endless.   By midsummer 2012, Iran's hackers, still recovering from an American and Israeli-led cyberattack on Iran's nuclear enrichment operations, found an easy target in Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company and the world's most valuable company.   That August, Iranian hackers flipped a kill switch at precisely 11:08 a.m., unleashing a simple wiper virus onto 30,000 Aramco computers and 10,000 servers that would destroy data, and replace it with a partial image of a burning American flag. The damage was tremendous.   Seven months later, during joint military exercises between American and South Korean forces, North Korean hackers, operating from computers inside China, deployed a very similar cyberweapon against computer networks at three major South Korean banks and South Korea's two largest broadcasters. Like Iran's Aramco attacks, the North Korean attacks on South Korean targets used wiping malware to eradicate data and paralyze their business operations.   It may have been a copycat operation, but Mr. Hannigan, the former British official, said recently: ''We have to assume they are getting help from the Iranians.''   And inside the National Security Agency, just a few years after analysts had written off Pyongyang as a low grade threat, there was suddenly a new appreciation that the country was figuring out cyber just as it had figured out nuclear weapons: test by test.   ''North Korea showed that to achieve its political objectives, it will take down any company -- period,'' Mr. Silvers said.   Protecting Kim's Image   A chief political objective of the cyberprogram is to preserve the image of the North's 33-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un. In August 2014, North Korean hackers went after a British broadcaster, Channel Four, which had announced plans for a television series about a British nuclear scientist kidnapped in Pyongyang.   First, the North Koreans protested to the British government. ''A scandalous farce,'' North Korea called the series. When that was ignored, British authorities found that the North had hacked into the television network's computer system. The attack was stopped before inflicting any damage, and David Abraham, the chief executive of Channel Four, initially vowed to continue the production.   That attack, however, was just a prelude. When Sony Pictures Entertainment released a trailer for ''The Interview,'' a comedy about two journalists dispatched to Pyongyang to assassinate North Korea's young new dictator, Pyongyang wrote a letter of complaint to the secretary general of the United Nations to stop the production. Then came threats to Sony.   Michael Lynton, then Sony's chief executive, said when Sony officials called the State Department, they were told it was just more ''bluster,'' he said.   ''At that point in time, Kim Jong-un was relatively new in the job, and I don't think it was clear yet how he was different from his father,'' Mr. Lynton said in an interview. ''Nobody ever mentioned anything about their cyber capabilities.''   In September 2014, while still attempting to crack Channel 4, North Korean hackers buried deep into Sony's networks, lurking patiently for the next three months, as both Sony and American intelligence completely missed their presence.   The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, was even in Pyongyang at the time, trying to win the release of a detained American, and had dinner with the then-chief of the Reconnaissance General Bureau.   On Nov. 24, the attack on Sony began: Employees arriving at work that day found their computer screens take over by picture of a red skeleton with a message signed ''GOP,'' for ''Guardians of Peace.''   ''We've obtained all your internal data including your secrets and top secrets,'' the message said. ''If you don't obey us, we'll release data shown below to the world.''   That was actually a diversion: The code destroyed 70 percent of Sony Pictures' laptops and computers. Sony employees were reduced to communicating via pen, paper and phone.   Mr. Lynton said the F.B.I. told him that nothing could have been done to prevent the attack, since it was waged by a sovereign state. ''We learned that you really have no way of protecting yourself in any meaningful way,'' he said of such nation-state attacks.   Sony struggled to distribute the film as theaters were intimidated. (Ultimately it was distributed for download, and may have done better than it would have.) In London, outside investors in Channel Four's North Korea project suddenly dried up, and the project effectively died.   The Obama White House responded to the Sony hack with sanctions that the North barely noticed, but with no other retaliation. ''A cyberbattle would be a lot more risky for the United States and its allies than for North Korea,'' said Mr. Silvers.   Robbing Banks, Pyongyang Style   Beyond respect, and retribution, the North wanted hard currency from its cyberprogram.   So soon the digital bank heists began -- an attack in the Philippines in October 2015; then the Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam at the end of the same year; and then the Bangladesh Central Bank. Researchers at Symantec said it was the first time a state had used a cyberattack not for espionage or war, but to finance the country's operations.   Now, the attacks are increasingly cunning. Security experts noticed in February that the website of Poland's financial regulator was unintentionally infecting visitors with malware.   It turned out that visitors to the Polish regulator's website -- employees from Polish banks, from the central banks of Brazil, Chile, Estonia, Mexico, Venezuela, and even from prominent Western banks like Bank of America -- had been targeted with a so-called watering hole attack, in which North Korean hackers waited for their victims to visit the site, then installed malware in their machines. Forensics showed that the hackers had put together a list of internet addresses from 103 organizations, most of them banks, and designed their malware to specifically infect visitors from those banks, in what researchers said appeared to be an effort to move around stolen currency.   More recently, North Koreans seemed to have changed tack once again. North Korean hackers' fingerprints showed up in a series of attempted attacks on so-called cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, and were successful in at least one case, according to researchers at FireEye.   The attacks on Bitcoin exchanges, which see hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin exchanged a day, offered Pyongyang a potentially very lucrative source of new funds. And, researchers say, there is evidence they have been exchanging Bitcoin gathered from their heists for Monero, a highly anonymous version of cryptocurrency that is far harder for global authorities to trace.   The most widespread hack was WannaCry, a global ransomware attack that used a program that cripples a computer and demands a ransom payment in exchange for unlocking the computer, or its data. In a twist the North Koreans surely enjoyed, their hackers based the attack on a secret tool, called ''Eternal Blue,'' stolen from the National Security Agency.   In the late afternoon of May 12, panicked phone calls flooded in from around Britain and the world. The computer systems of several major British hospital systems were shut down, forcing diversions of ambulances and the deferral of nonemergency surgeries. Banks and transportation systems across dozens of countries were affected.   Britain's National Cyber Security Center had picked up no warning of the attack, said Paul Chichester, its director of operations. Investigators now think the WannaCry attack may have been an early misfire of a weapon that was still under development -- or a test of tactics and vulnerabilities.   ''This was part of an evolving effort to find ways to disable key industries,'' said Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and cyber operations at the Government Communications Headquarters in Britain. ''All I have to do is create a moderately disabling attack on a key part of the social infrastructure, and then watch the media sensationalize it and panic the public.''   It ended thanks to Marcus Hutchins, a college dropout and self-taught hacker living with his parents in the southwest of England. He spotted a web address somewhere in the software and, on a lark, paid $10.69 to register it as a domain name. The activation of the domain name turned out to act as a kill switch causing the malware to stop spreading.   British officials privately acknowledge that they know North Korea perpetrated the attack, but the government has taken no retaliatory action, uncertain what they can do.   A Cyber Arms Race   While American and South Korean officials often express outrage about North Korea's cyberactivities, they rarely talk about their own -- and whether that helps fuel the cyber arms race.   Yet both Seoul and Washington target the North's Reconnaissance General Bureau, its nuclear program and its missile program. Hundreds, if not thousands, of American cyberwarriors spend each day mapping the North's few networks, looking for vulnerabilities that could be activated in time of crisis.   At a recent meeting of American strategists to evaluate North Korea's capabilities, some participants expressed concerns that the escalating cyberwar could actually tempt the North to use its weapons -- both nuclear and cyber -- very quickly in any conflict, for fear that the United States has secret ways to shut the country down.   The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo, said last week that the United States is trying to compile a better picture of the leadership around Kim Jong-un, for a report to President Trump. Figuring out who oversees cyber and special operations is a central mystery. The Japanese press recently speculated it could be an official named Jang Kil-su. Others are curious about Gen. No Kwang-chol, who was elevated to the Central Committee of the North's ruling party in May 2016, and is one of the only members whose portfolio is undisclosed.   The big question is whether Mr. Kim, fearful that his nuclear program is becoming too large and obvious a target, is focusing instead on how to shut down the United States without ever lighting off a missile. ''Everyone is focused on mushroom clouds,'' Mr. Silvers said, ''but there is far more potential for another kind of disastrous escalation.''     "
New Windows for the Fall Season,"Q. I see there's yet another Windows 10 update out now. I get notifications about patches all the time, so how do I know when this notice is for a system upgrade? Can I tell if it already installed itself?  A. Microsoft began rolling out its Windows 10 Fall Creators Update last Tuesday using the Windows Update utility on compatible computers and devices. When you are checking the available updates, look for the one labeled ''Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709'' in the list of security patches and other listed software fixes in Windows Update.    You can manually check to see if the software is ready for you. Just click or tap the Start button on the Windows 10 desktop, and select Settings; as a keyboard shortcut to the Settings box, you can also press the Windows and I keys. In the Settings window, select the Update & Security icon, and on the next screen choose Windows Update on the left side of the window. Next, click or tap the ''Check for updates'' button on the right side of the window. You should see a list of available updates for your computer or tablet.   To see if the update has been installed already -- especially if other people use the computer and may have taken care of it -- open the Windows 10 Settings box and choose System and then About. Look to see if ''Windows 10, version 1709'' is listed there.   Microsoft has a list of new features included with the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update on its site. A blog post on the company site also has a 30-minute video tour and a highlighted list of changes to the system, like the ability to annotate PDF files and e-books in Microsoft Edge, use new voice commands with Cortana and protect your PC against ransomware.

Russian Hackers Find Ready Bullhorns in the Media; The Interpreter,"As the dust settles on Russian interference in the United States election, journalists are confronting an aspect that has received less scrutiny than the hacking itself but poses its own thorny questions: Moscow's ability to steer Western media coverage by doling out hacked documents. Reporters have always relied on sources who provide critical information for self-interested reasons. The duty, tricky but familiar, is to publicize information that serves the public interest without falling prey to the source's agenda. But in this case, the source was Russia's military intelligence agency, the G.R.U. - operating through shadowy fronts who worked to mask that fact - and its agenda was to undermine the American presidential election. By releasing documents that would tarnish Hillary Clinton and other American political figures, but whose news value compelled coverage, Moscow exploited the very openness that is the basis of a free press. Its tactics have evolved with each such operation, some of which are still unfolding.  Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies at King's College London who is tracking the Russian influence campaign, said it goes well beyond hacking: ""It's political engineering, social engineering on a strategic level."" A New Dark Art Great powers have long meddled in one another's affairs. But Russia, throughout 2016, developed a previously unseen tactic: setting up fronts to seed into the press documents it had obtained by hacking. ""Doing public relations work in order to get the hacked material out as an exclusive story with the Daily Caller or Gawker or the Smoking Gun, that is new,"" Mr. Rid said. That public relations work was initially done by two web presences that appeared this summer, Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks, each posing as activist-hackers in the mold of Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks chief. Though neither acknowledged it, and the links were not immediately known, online security experts later concluded that both were Russian fronts. Guccifer 2.0 claimed to be a Romanian ""freedom fighter"" who had hacked the Democratic National Committee. Using Twitter's private message service, the account conducted weekslong exchanges with journalists, pointing them to certain documents that had been hacked from the D.N.C. and other targets. ""Whoever is doing this understands media. They understand the way that media works and how to manipulate media,"" said Sheera Frenkel, a BuzzFeed News reporter who interacted with the fronts throughout the summer. DCLeaks, established separately and with its own sets of hacked documents, claimed to be ""launched by the American hacktivists who respect and appreciate freedom of speech."" The fronts sold the act by peppering their messages with slang and emojis. When Ms. Frenkel asked Guccifer whether it would release more D.N.C. documents, the reply came, ""Yeah baby :)"" Journalists who interacted with the accounts say their tone and facility with English varied widely, suggesting each was run by multiple users. A reporter with Motherboard, a technology site, quizzed Guccifer on the technical aspects of the hacking and on rudimentary Romanian. Guccifer failed both, lending credence to theories that it was a front. Those suspicions were initially restricted to security experts, trickling out only after firms such as ThreatConnect were able to unmask the fronts in detailed reports. In July, for instance, DCLeaks published emails belonging to retired Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove. The Intercept, a left-leaning site, covered the emails in a story that portrayed Mr. Breedlove as trying to foment hostility against Russia. The story did not note Russian links to the hack. Its lead author, Lee Fang, said he had no interactions with DCLeaks and pointed out that the group's suspected Russian ties were not widely publicized at that time. 'Almost More Like a P.R. Firm' Some reporters were offered documents exclusively, a familiar tactic of government press offices and public relations firms that want to shape coverage. In September, DCLeaks contacted Peter Hasson, a reporter at the Daily Caller, a right-leaning site, with an offer: password-protected access to hacked emails belonging to Colin Powell, the former secretary of state. The Daily Caller's story also did not note the growing belief that the documents had been hacked by Russia and leaked as part of an influence operation. Mr. Hasson said he was unaware of the alleged Russian links at the time. After awareness grew, the front organizations dropped the pretense. The newest group called itself Fancy Bears Hack Team - a breathtakingly overt reference to ""fancy bear,"" the name that some Western security groups use for G.R.U. hackers. Tom Cheshire, a reporter with the British network Sky News who has dealt with Fancy Bears, said they behaved ""almost more like a P.R. firm, really"" and were ""very businesslike,"" doling out scoops and trying to shape coverage. ""It's the sort of horse trading you do with all sorts of sources, really,"" Mr. Cheshire said, hitting on a key to the operation's impact: the way that it played within the bounds of established journalistic norms. Any leak by any source - Russian agent or citizen whistle-blower - poses a similar set of quandaries for reporters. Do you emphasize the hacking itself in your coverage, knowing that this will undercut the source's agenda but could also be a disservice to readers by putting less focus on newsworthy information in the release? Do you withhold newsworthy documents, even only temporarily, to check their veracity and provenance? What if they have already been reported by other outlets that were shown the documents first? If they did turn out to be hacked as part of a hostile foreign operation, does that really make their contents less newsworthy? These are old questions for journalists, but they have taken on new urgency with the scale of Russia's hackings and aims. Masked Motives Though the calculus of reporting on agenda-driven leaks may be familiar, one aspect of the Russian operation stands out: the lengths to which the fronts go to mask their identities and motives. Because the internet gives any outlet the potential to reach millions, all it takes is one well-placed leak to send the document flying across the web. Last year, Russian-linked hackers infiltrated the United States Anti-Doping Agency, most likely in retaliation for accusations of state-sponsored doping among Russia's Olympic athletes. But Fancy Bears struggled to place the stolen documents with American or British outlets. Reporters who saw the files said their news value did not outweigh the risk of serving Russian interests. When Fancy Bears offered the files to The Associated Press, the reporters instead published a story on the Russian-linked group itself. Fancy Bears ultimately persuaded sportswriters with Spiegel, a prominent German outlet, to report on emails that appeared to show American athletes requesting medical exceptions to take restricted drugs. The article noted a possible Russian link only in the final lines, alongside a quote from an American official arguing that the leak was intended to distract from state-sponsored doping. If mainstream outlets pass on a hacking, government-linked fronts can always pass the documents to peripheral outfits who will lend them less weight but can still send them across social media. That has often included the website InfoWars, which was founded by the right-wing radio host Alex Jones and often publishes conspiracy theories. Guccifer 2.0 approached Mikael Thalen, a writer for InfoWars, with D.N.C. documents that showed Democrats' plans for attacking Paul Manafort, a campaign manager to Donald J. Trump who had worked on behalf of the now-deposed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin ally. Mr. Thalen had come to believe, after many interactions with the front groups, that they ""would reach out based on who would best carry the story the way they wanted it carried."" He feared that Moscow was hoping InfoWars, by publishing the files, would muddy the water around accusations against Mr. Manafort, indirectly aiding Mr. Trump's then-flailing campaign. Breaking with InfoWars' usual reliance on such files, he declined to publish the documents. Developing Antibodies Because everyone has secrets, even if it's only a few embarrassing personal emails, and because no network is impenetrable, skilled hackers can dig up compromising material on virtually any target. Democracies, which give privilege to competitive politics and free media, are particularly susceptible. ""An open society is by choice more vulnerable than a closed society to some form of influence operation,"" said Mr. Rid. ""That is why we're strong, but it's also why we're weak."" The more that journalists and readers understand the motivations of foreign government leakers, he argued, the better they will be able to place those leaks in context, undercutting the hackers' agenda without hiding newsworthy information. He compared this to a healthy body developing antibodies against a disease - foreign influence operations - that cannot be wholly immunized against while maintaining democratic openness. Still, some media trends - polarization, fake news, the crowd-driven nature of social media - cut against those hopes. ""This polarized election presented itself as a target of opportunity of the first order,"" Mr. Rid said. Reporters may at times be hindered by a lack of transparency between media organizations, which are often highly competitive and prize speed and scoops. This has left reporters vulnerable because they cannot easily pool lessons on spotting foreign operations or, say, warn one another that a certain front is exaggerating the newsworthiness of its latest leak. ""The more light shone on this, the more information you have when dealing with a source, the better decisions you're going to make,"" Mr. Cheshire said. Mr. Thalen, the InfoWars reporter, said he was increasingly turning down leaks that he knows his audience would read avidly and reward with acclaim, but that he considered exaggerated to advance Russian interests. Still, he was unsure it had made much difference. ""A lot of people have swayed their reporting with their biases, and I didn't want to do that,"" he said. ""People are believing what they want to be true."" PHOTO: Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, which was accused of helping Russia interfere with the United States election.

The Fallout From a Global Cyberattack: 'A Battle We're Fighting Every Day',"On Sunday, union representatives for a Renault auto plant in France received text messages from the management: Tell the workers to stay home the next day. The company was still dealing with the fallout from a global hack that hit thousands of businesses and the factory would be shut. Since the hack was first detected on Friday, the company's technicians have been racing to assess the damage. They have cleaned and rebooted systems that control robots on Renault's factory floors, trying to make sure their systems were back to normal.     As universities, hospitals and businesses around the world continue to take stock from a global hack that has locked up at least 200,000 machines since last week, they are going through much the same process. Many are also trying to determine if they have lost any data or if their systems are safe. Some are trying to figure out whether they should pay the ransom, or whether they have backups that will allow them to avoid giving in.   On Saturday morning, technicians inspecting computers at Renault's Sandouville operation in northern France found a demand in French for a $300 Bitcoin ransom with a threat to erase data. The carmaker decided not to pay.   But Renault will face other costs from shutting factories. Production is slowed, for example, and it will need to pay partial unemployment insurance for the thousands of employees at the Douai site who were not able to work on Monday.   The fallout for companies and institutions is growing by the day. The hack spread to thousands of additional computers on Monday, largely in China, India and Russia, although the pace of the rogue software's advance appeared to be subsiding, at least temporarily. The attack is even causing consternation at companies not affected so far, as they shore up their own defenses -- and leaving them feeling more relieved than reassured.   ''It's a battle we're fighting every day,'' said William Caraher, chief information officer at von Briesen & Roper, a midsize law firm in Milwaukee.   ''We live in this world where any email attachment could be carrying malicious software that could go viral,'' he said.   Gauging the extent of the disruption globally is difficult. Some companies report attacks, but many do not, fearing potential damage to their corporate reputations. For some, the modest $300 ransom is an incentive to pay and move on, said Greg Young, an analyst at Gartner.   In Germany, the hackers' ransom demands popped up over the weekend on the screens of ticket vending machines of Deutsche Bahn, the national railway. On Monday, Deutsche Bahn technicians were still working to remove the malware, and some vending machine screens were displaying plain text advising travelers to get information elsewhere -- on the railway's website or smartphone app.   But Deutsche Bahn emphasized that the hacking had no effect on its train service or signaling systems. And like many other organizations affected by the hack, the railroad was hoping the worst was over.   In the United States, FedEx, the giant package shipper, which had been hit in the attack that began on Friday, said that it had ''resumed normal operations'' and that its computer systems were healthy again.   In Asia, though, some of the challenges are just beginning. China alone reported disruptions at nearly 40,000 organizations, including about 4,000 academic institutions, figures that experts say are most likely to be low estimates, given the prevalence of pirated software there.   The list of affected organizations includes two of China's most prestigious institutions of higher education, Tsinghua and Peking Universities; a movie theater chain in South Korea; and blue-chip companies in Japan like Hitachi and Nissan, which emphasized that their business operations had not been impaired.   China's state-run oil company, PetroChina, confirmed that the attack had disrupted the electronic payment capabilities at many of its gas stations over the weekend. By Sunday, 80 percent of its stations were functioning normally again, it said.   In Britain, where the attack was first detected on Friday, the National Health Service struggled to get hospitals, clinics and doctors' offices fully operational. The attack had caused some patients to be turned away from emergency rooms, and surgical procedures and medical appointments needed to be rescheduled.   In Sandbach, in northwest England, John Cosgrove, a 42-year-old general practitioner, said things were recovering, but he still did not have access to complete patient records. And the public seems to be putting off medical care that can be postponed until the N.H.S. computer systems are up and running normally again.   ''On Friday, there was a feeling of chaos,'' Dr. Cosgrove said. ''But there are not many people booking to see us. It does feel quite different still.''   Until computer security experts closely examine infected machines, they will not know the mechanism by which the malicious software got into the computers and then spread.   The malware used by the attackers was sophisticated, security experts say, but the collection mechanism was not, by the current standards of ransomware, said Caleb Barlow, vice president in change of threat intelligence for IBM.   Some perpetrators include instructions for how to pay by Bitcoin -- and even examples of people who paid and regained access to their data, and those who did not. But this global ransomware attack did not include such payment-easing features, Mr. Barlow said, and may account for the modest level of estimated payments so far. ''That is a bit of a head-scratcher,'' he said.   The Bitcoin payments as of late Monday afternoon were just under $60,000, according the Chainalysis, a Bitcoin analytics firm. The largest transaction was $3,300, said Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis, suggesting that large corporations and government agencies have not been paying.   The cyberattack underlines the growing problem of ransomware.   IBM's security research unit collects and monitors about 45 million pieces of spam a day worldwide. In 2015, less than 1 percent of the spam was ransomware. By last year, 40 percent had a document or web link that activated ransomware, and the current attack threatens to lift that percentage higher.   On Monday, Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, told employees at a town-hall meeting in New York that hackers had contacted the company to claim access to one of its unreleased movies and had demanded a ransom. Mr. Iger, who did not identify the film, said that Disney is not paying and has been working with federal investigators to resolve the matter.   It was not clear if a Disney film had actually fallen into hackers' hands or if the attack on Disney was related to the one over the weekend. A Disney spokeswoman did not respond to queries.     "
A New Russian Ploy: Competing Extradition Requests,"MOSCOW -- The Russian spam kingpin had long been in the cross hairs of the F.B.I., and agents finally got their shot when the man scheduled a vacation in Spain. At the agency's request, Spanish security officers in April arrested the man, Pyotr Y. Levashov, who is accused of stuffing untold millions of inboxes with ads for pornography, pills and penny stocks. But then the Russian authorities sprang a trap of their own, filing an extradition request with the Spanish authorities for a crime they said Mr. Levashov had committed in Russia years ago. Currently, he is languishing in a Spanish jail, but soon the authorities will have to decide which extradition request to honor: the United States' or Russia's.    This was by no means the first time that Russia had filed a competing extradition request. Far-fetched as it may seem, the Russians' tactic has in several instances prevented Russians suspected of being computer criminals from being deported to the United States while detained in Europe.    The tactic has raised suspicions that the Russian authorities are more interested in derailing American investigations and possibly protecting criminals they find useful than they are in fighting cybercrime.   ''People always ask me about this,'' Timofey S. Musatov, a Moscow lawyer whose Russian client is the subject of competing extradition requests. ''It's the most common question.''   In Mr. Levashov's case, Russian prosecutors sought his extradition after his detention in Spain when they discovered in August that he had hacked the computers of a hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2014.   Three similar cases are pending in courts in Greece, Spain and the Czech Republic. In two of the three, either the defendants' lawyers or relatives have said that their cases have some bearing on the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election in the United States. While that may be true, they have not provided any proof.   Their theory is that with the politically charged atmosphere in the United States over the election meddling, the accused could not possibly get a fair trial there, so they should be returned to Russia.   In accordance with extradition treaties in all three countries, Russian lawyers say, the decision about where to send the accused resides with a government minister. That opens the prospect of the United States' being powerless to stop the return to Russia of a suspect who may be able to offer valuable information on Russian meddling in the election.   The Greek police detained Mr. Musatov's client, Aleksandr V. Vinnik, on an American  warrant that accuses him of running a Moscow-based Bitcoin exchange, BTC-e, that laundered as much as $4 billion in illegal funds. Russian prosecutors filed an extradition request on a fraud charge.   The Russian case, Mr. Musatov said, surfaced soon after Mr. Vinnik's detention in Athens, possibly because the Russian police had read about his client in news reports and decided to investigate him.   ''I'm a procedural lawyer who works with documents and law,'' he said. ''I don't work in the category of conspiracy theories.'' Mr. Vinnik has no known links to election hacking, he said.   Another of Mr. Musatov's clients, Dmitry O. Zubakha, who at the request of the United States was detained in Cyprus in 2012 on suspicion of hacking Amazon, was successfully extradited to Russia.   ''This norm is in effect everywhere,'' said Vladimir V. Makeyev, a lawyer for another Russian cybercrime suspect, Yevgeny A. Nikulin, who was detained in Prague while on vacation with his girlfriend.   The United States accuses Mr. Nikulin of hacking the computers of LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring. Russia filed an extradition request after a computer intrusion and online theft that occurred in 2010 but came to light only after his detention in the Czech Republic.   Mr. Makeyev argues that the United States is seeking Mr. Nikulin's cooperation in the election-hacking investigation and that an F.B.I. agent from the San Francisco field office, Jeffrey Miller, traveled to Prague to offer asylum in exchange for testimony. The F.B.I. has said the agent was there only to read Mr. Nikulin his rights, and it remains unclear how he may have been connected to election hacking.   Why Russians suspected of hacking travel to countries that may detain them on United States extradition warrants is something of a mystery. ''Once the money starts coming in, they enjoy a good lifestyle,'' said John Reid, a senior researcher with Spamhaus, a spam tracking group based in London.   Perhaps impunity at home creates a false sense of security. ''We'll see pictures of them sitting around with gold and fancy Western cars and guns. That kind of gives a profile'' of high-rolling Russian hackers, he said.   One theory for the travel, he said, is the ''girlfriend effect'': ''You are a little hacking nerd and now you have a good-looking girlfriend, and it gets cold in Russia, and she says, 'It's cold; I hate it here,' and it wears him down, so he goes somewhere sunny, and that's it.''   Mr. Levashov, too, has claimed a political motivation for his arrest in Barcelona last spring, though a federal indictment unsealed in Connecticut charges him only with eight counts of computer-related crime and fraud. Mr. Levashov's wife, Maria, said in an interview that the Spanish police had told her the arrest was ''related to the election.''   The American indictment asserts that Mr. Levashov, using the nickname Peter Severa, or Peter of the North, ran a spam operation powered by a sophisticated, evolving family of computer viruses called Waledac, and later Kelihos. Mr. Levashov's nickname may be derived from his northern hometown, St. Petersburg, or the name of a porn movie star, referring to the pornography promoted by spam email.   Mr. Levashov told a Spanish court that the case should be viewed politically because he had worked for United Russia, a political party that backs President Vladimir V. Putin, and he is an army officer with access to Russian classified information.   ''I collected different information about opposition parties and delivered it to the necessary people at the necessary time,'' Mr. Levashov told the court, referring to Russian opposition parties, according to the Russian Information Agency.   In an online chat room for hackers years earlier, using the nickname Peter Severa, Mr. Levashov had gone further, suggesting that he had enlisted in a broad recruitment effort by the Russian government, begun about four years ago, to engage students, computer professionals and criminals in government hacking teams, sometimes called science squadrons.   ''Good day,'' he wrote. ''My name is Peter Severa. Many people know me for my service distributing email.'' But ''everything is in flux, everything changes, and the time has come for me to change the direction of my work.''   He said he had a new role: The Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., had appointed him to lead a group of hackers who would work for the security service, which he called a ''special battalion for information security.''

The Risk in Using a Public Phone Charger,"Q. Can a phone really get hacked by plugging it into a public USB charging station? A. If you have ever backed up your phone's contents by plugging into the computer, you have seen how the USB port can transfer data as well as charge the device's battery. The concept of ''juice-jacking'' has been proved at hacker conventions and seen in the wild, and it is definitely possible to transfer malicious software with a phone through a USB connection -- perhaps from a computer or device concealed within a public charging station, like those found in airports or malls.     If you are traveling and are concerned about keeping your phone's battery charged, bring your own USB cable and AC adapter so you can plug right into a regular power outlet. The Wirecutter, a product-recommendation site owned by The Times, has suggestions for USB battery packs to bring along when you expect to be away from an outlet for long periods of time.   Other solutions for protecting your phone include taking (or making) a power-only USB cable that lacks the internal wiring needed to transfer data. If you do not have one of those cables, power off the device before you plug it into a public charging port (although this is not a foolproof solution for every phone model out there).   Last year, the Federal Trade Commission warned consumers against connecting a personal smartphone to the entertainment system through a USB port or Bluetooth wireless link in a rental car. This is because the dashboard software can import and store data from your phone, like your call logs, messages, contacts and locations you requested from the GPS software.   The F.T.C. suggests using the car's electrical port and a compatible cable to charge the phone instead of plugging into the USB port. If you do connect to the car's system, remember to delete your device's information from the dashboard settings.

F.C.C. Halts New Data Security Rule,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday halted new government rules related to data security from taking effect this week, in a potential prelude to a broader repeal of privacy protections for users of high-speed internet. After a 2-to-1, party-line vote by the Republican-led commission, Ajit Pai, the chairman, announced that a portion of privacy rules passed in October would be temporarily stayed.     The rules, which were to take effect on Thursday, required high-speed internet providers like AT&T and Comcast to secure their customers' data against hacking and other unauthorized uses.   Mr. Pai, in a sign that additional swipes at privacy rules may be in store, also said the commission should not be engaged in any policing of broadband providers over online privacy. He said the Federal Trade Commission should instead oversee the broadband and web industries.   ''All actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules, enforced by the same agency,'' Mr. Pai said in a joint statement with Maureen K. Ohlhausen, the trade commission's acting chairwoman.   The vote on the data security rules was Mr. Pai's latest move to roll back regulations created by his predecessor, Tom Wheeler, who was appointed by President Barack Obama.   During Mr. Wheeler's tenure, the F.C.C. created numerous regulations meant to protect users of broadband internet, including the privacy rules passed in October that required strong data-security measures and allowed internet service providers to collect data on web browsing and app usage only with the permission of customers.   The commission has moved swiftly to dismantle those regulations since Mr. Pai's appointment as chairman in January.   The agency has closed an investigation into claims that internet service providers may have been violating net neutrality provisions ensuring equal access to all websites, and has pledged to revoke the regulatory classification of broadband service under which it is treated like a telephone-style utility.   Under Mr. Pai's leadership, the commission has also halted nine broadband providers from giving subsidized service to low-income users, putting in limbo reforms to a subsidy program known as Lifeline.   Mr. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, is expected to move to repeal other portions of the privacy rules passed in October. He has the support of congressional Republicans, who are simultaneously considering their own repeal of the rules through the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to vote to revoke new regulations.   The vote to stay the new data security rules came in response to petitions filed by broadband providers and advertising trade groups that said the rules would give web companies like Google and Facebook an unfair advantage in the online advertising market. Mr. Pai said the F.C.C. might create a weaker version of the privacy rules.   Mignon Clyburn, the F.C.C.'s lone Democratic commissioner, voted against Mr. Pai's order on Wednesday. She has objected to many of his actions, including a decision to abandon the commission's legal fight to lower how much prisoners pay to make phone calls, which Ms. Clyburn has called a civil rights issue.   The F.C.C. is halting the security rules even as data breaches have become routine, Ms. Clyburn said in a statement, adding that the decision opened the door to further reductions in consumer protections.   The F.C.C. decision, Ms. Clyburn said in the statement, ''fells a tree to ostensibly prune a branch.''   Consumer advocates had hailed the privacy rules as a watershed development. There are currently no privacy laws for web firms, and the United States trails many nations in Europe in protecting consumer's online data.   ''Internet service providers have a unique, all-access view into consumers' daily online lives,'' said Laura MacCleery, a vice president at Consumers Union. ''We urge the F.C.C. to focus on acting in the public's interest -- rather than the industry's -- and to maintain these critical rules.''   Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang.     "
An Attack on Internet Privacy,"Republicans just made clear how little they care about protecting the privacy of Americans by letting companies like Verizon and Comcast sell advertisers the internet browsing histories and other personal data of their customers without getting permission. The move could bolster the profits of the telecommunications industry by billions of dollars.  Following a party-line vote in the Senate last week, the House approved a resolution on Tuesday that would overturn a broadband privacy regulation the Federal Communications Commission adopted in October. That rule requires cable and phone companies to obtain consent before using information like which websites people visited to show them customized ads and to build detailed profiles on them. The White House said on Tuesday that President Trump would sign the legislation, which would also prohibit the F.C.C. from adopting a similar policy in the future.    Most Americans spend much of their lives online. They should be able to do so without fear that their internet service providers are logging their activities and selling the data. There is a long tradition of the government protecting such information. For example, the F.C.C. has long restricted what phone companies can do with call records. And in 1988 Congress prohibited video stores from disclosing the movies people rented.   Republican lawmakers, like Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, and the chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, say that the commission's privacy rule is unfair because it applies only to broadband companies and not to internet businesses like Google and Facebook. This is highly disingenuous. Congress has only given the commission authority over telecommunications companies, so the F.C.C. couldn't have come up with rules that applied to other businesses even if it wanted to.   Telecom companies know a lot about what people do online because they are the gatekeepers through which people connect to the internet. And as people link household devices like thermostats, light bulbs and security cameras to the internet, these companies will have even more intimate knowledge about their customers. By comparison, people can more easily evade tracking by businesses like Google and Facebook by not using those services or by deleting the cookies those websites leave on their computers and phones.   In the absence of strong privacy rules, people will have to rely on encryption to prevent service providers from tracking them. But broadband companies would still know what websites people visit. And the companies would be able to see all of the communications between users and websites that do not use encryption. Sophisticated users might increasingly rely on virtual private networks, which are used by corporations to let their employees log into secure systems remotely, and other tools to mask their activities, but most Americans are unlikely to be conversant with such tricks of the trade.   Mr. Trump promised voters during the campaign that he would protect the working class. But now he and his party are moving quickly to do the bidding of a very different interest group: Big Telecom.

A Hacking Story's Open Sources,"Of all the surprises Michael Schwirtz and Joseph Goldstein encountered while reporting today's front-page story on America's most wanted hacker, perhaps none was bigger than this: For once, the F.B.I. was excited to talk to them. ''There was a willingness to speak with us about this case,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''I was somewhat pleasantly surprised, and I rarely have that feeling when trying the F.B.I. for help on stories.''     The bureau was so obliging, Mr. Goldstein said, in part because Evgeniy M. Bogachev is a fugitive. The attention generated by a widely read newspaper report can spur those who might have knowledge of his activities to come forward in hopes of reward money. (In this instance, the amount -- $3 million -- is the most ever offered in a computer-crimes case.)   After the Obama administration placed sanctions on Russia following election-related hacking, Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Schwirtz set out to fill in what they saw as a hole in news media coverage of the issue: No one had attempted to profile Mr. Bogachev, one of two private Russian citizens named in the sanctions.   In fact, throughout their reporting, Mr. Schwirtz and Mr. Goldstein were struck by the information hiding in plain sight and by the detail it contained -- unusual for cybercrime and espionage cases.   Even Mr. Bogachev's Most Wanted poster was surprisingly rich.   Mr. Goldstein compared the poster with one released by the State Department promising a $10 million reward for information leading to the capture of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Officials offered ''virtually nothing beyond that he was the spiritual leader of the Taliban,'' he said.   Not so with Mr. Bogachev: ''The wanted poster here described where he has real estate, his birthday, where he likes to sail his boat,'' Mr. Goldstein said.   They obtained the remarkable lead photo for the story -- of Mr. Bogachev posing, in leopard-print pajamas, with a Bengal cat -- from a Powerpoint presentation put on, at a conference, by an F.B.I. agent and cybersecurity researchers.   (''Mike pinned down the breed of cat,'' Mr. Goldstein said, in a testament to the power of reporting in tandem. ''I would have just written 'cat.''')   Though Mr. Schwirtz traveled to Ukraine to conduct some interviews, the two tracked down a number of sources online. They spoke to several hackers linked to Mr. Bogachev, one of whom is in prison in Kentucky and was reachable by email.   And as today's story explains, under the Russian government's patronage, Mr. Bogachev has spurned the anonymity of a dark web hacker in favor of a flamboyant lifestyle in a beachside resort town -- a lifestyle that leaves behind a digital trail.   After a source tipped them off to Mr. Bogachev's involvement in a lawsuit with a real estate company, Mr. Schwirtz took an unconventional shot: He contacted the man listed in court documents as Mr. Bogachev's lawyer, via Facebook.   Still, it was intelligence operatives -- current and former, in both the United States and Ukraine -- who proved the most indispensable sources.   They shared, for instance, screen names Mr. Bogachev has used as a hacker -- and the method they had used to isolate them. The trick, they explained, ''is to go back in time as far as possible, to a point where an individual was not as security-conscious as he or she would come to be later in their career,'' Mr. Schwirtz said.   (Mr. Bogachev was initially identified thanks to an email ''that was not nearly as secure as he eventually made all of his communications,'' he elaborated.)   In the end, agents were forthcoming with leads on nearly every aspect of the Bogachev case -- with a single exception. ''The one area that became quite fraught was the discussion of the espionage, at which point most of the agents started breathing heavily and changed the subject,'' Mr. Schwirtz said. ''I guess that's understandable.''     "
Tech Roundup: Behind One of Yahoo's Big Hacks,"Tensions between the United States and Russia have festered for months over the issue of cybersecurity. Russian hackers were identified by American intelligence officials as having tried to aid Donald J. Trump during the presidential election last year, at the expense of Hillary Clinton.  On Wednesday, the Justice Department said Russians were also behind another prominent hacking: a giant breach at the internet company Yahoo in 2014, when 500 million user accounts were compromised.    Federal officials said two Russian intelligence officers were responsible for the breach, along with a Russian hacker and a Kazakh national living in Canada, write Vindu Goel and Eric Lichtblau, reporters for The New York Times. The Russian government then used the information obtained through the Yahoo breach to target American executives and other officials, according to the indictment from the Justice Department.   The development is likely to deepen questions over how much the United States and Russia can trust and work with each other. The relationship is also in the spotlight because of comments President Trump has made about his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, which have raised some eyebrows.   At least one person was thankful that the Justice Department had brought its indictment out over the Yahoo breach. Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive, who is also grappling with another hacking of some 1 billion user accounts at the company, wrote in a message on Twitter that she was ''very grateful'' to the American authorities for getting to the bottom of things.   Very grateful to the FBI & DOJ for bringing to justice the Russian officials & hackers who led the attack on Yahoo.https://t.co/AQ4qHpPv6C -- marissamayer (@marissamayer) March 15, 2017   More tech news:   A video gamer's death during a 24-hour live stream raises questions about a lifestyle.

Rubio Says His Campaign Was a Target of Russian Attacks,"WASHINGTON -- Senator Marco Rubio said Thursday during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Russia that his own presidential campaign had been a target of apparent Russian cyberattacks, and a cybersecurity expert testified that Mr. Rubio might have been the victim of a Russian online smear campaign. The hearing, which surveyed Russia's long history of waging foreign influence campaigns -- efforts that have continued since the November election -- was intended to lay the groundwork for the committee's investigation of Moscow's meddling in the presidential race.     Mr. Rubio, Republican of Florida and one of President Trump's primary challengers, said that former members of his campaign had been targeted as recently as Wednesday morning in attacks traced to IP addresses in Russia.   He said that similar attacks had also taken place in July, roughly four months after he dropped out of the race, and that the attempts had been unsuccessful. His spokesman declined to elaborate.   But Mr. Rubio immediately sought to play down his remarks, cautioning his colleagues during the hearing not to become too focused on hacking, ''one aspect of a much broader campaign.''   ''We've focused on the trees and have lost sight of the forest,'' Mr. Rubio said.   Other Republicans on the panel expressed some skepticism over the pervasiveness of Russian interference in the campaign. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri asked whether the experts who had been brought in to testify had seen any evidence of direct Russian interference in county election systems, something he said ''should never be allowed to happen.'' No, they said.   Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, cast doubt on the conclusion of intelligence agencies that Russians had acted specifically to aid Mr. Trump in the election. ''Do you have any reason to believe that Putin knew more than the pundits and pollsters did here in America about the outcome of the election before it occurred?'' Mr. Cornyn asked, referring to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.   No, came the reply.   ''I didn't think so,'' Mr. Cornyn said.   In one remarkable exchange, Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, asked why Mr. Putin had chosen this election to meddle in.   Clint Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who is now a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said that while Russia had sought to interfere in elections around the world, its efforts in last year's American election were especially potent because Mr. Trump's campaign had ''parroted'' the same lines used in Russian propaganda. Mr. Trump cited a fake news article in at least one stump speech, Mr. Watts said, adding that his claims of a ''rigged'' election were in line with claims made by the Russian state news media.   ''I don't think the president actually realizes what he's citing,'' Mr. Watts told reporters after the hearing. ''He picks up on a conspiracy and he repeats it, and then we have the entire United States government pivoting to try and determine whether it's fact or fiction.''   Mr. Watts also said he believed that Mr. Rubio had been the target of Russian campaigns to discredit him, a disclosure that appeared to startle the senator. After the hearing, Mr. Watts said that Mr. Rubio had not been the only target, asserting that negative online campaigns had cropped up at key moments against other candidates, including former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.   Democrats, for their part, emphasized the importance of gathering more information, including financial documents like Mr. Trump's tax returns, to determine whether Mr. Trump or his associates had colluded with the Russians, as well as the need to examine the lack of a government response to the Russian interference.   ''The size of this, the enormity of this matter, is just eclipsing everything else in my mind,'' said Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. ''And yet there's no response.''   The hearing -- heavy on policy and flecked with a few conspicuously chummy interludes between Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the panel's Republican chairman, and its top Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia -- presented a stark contrast to the turmoil plaguing the House Intelligence Committee's parallel investigation. Mr. Burr called it ''a foundational hearing for our investigation.''   Across the Capitol, the House panel grappled on Thursday with a New York Times report identifying two White House officials who played a role in providing intelligence reports to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the committee's chairman. Last week, Mr. Nunes said those documents indicated that Mr. Trump or people on his transition team, of which Mr. Nunes was a member, might have been ''incidentally'' caught up in surveillance of foreign operatives by American spy agencies. He chose to immediately brief Mr. Trump on the development, but not his Democratic counterpart on the committee.   One day after Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner held a joint news conference to express their commitment to a serious investigation, Mr. Warner emphasized what was foremost in their minds. ''Do any of you have any doubt that it was Russia and Russian agents that perpetrated, during the 2016 presidential campaign, the hacks of the D.N.C. and the Podesta emails and the misinformation and disinformation campaign that took place?'' he asked the experts called before the panel, referring to the Democratic National Committee and John D. Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign.   ''It absolutely stretches credulity to think they weren't involved,'' said Kevin Mandia, the chief executive of FireEye, a cybersecurity company.     "
Hacking Group Claims N.S.A. Infiltrated Backbone of Mideast Bank System,"For the past few months, an elite hacking group calling itself the Shadow Brokers has sporadically leaked sensitive data from the National Security Agency. On Friday, just when its leaks had appeared to slow, the group released what appears to be its most damaging leak so far: a trove of highly classified hacking tools used to break into various Microsoft systems, along with what it said was evidence that the N.S.A. had infiltrated the backbone of the Middle East's banking infrastructure. The timing of the leaks coincides with the United States' recent shift in policy in Syria, which has escalated the conflict with the Syrian government's main backer, Russia. The Shadow Brokers wrote in broken English in an online post, which cited the American missile attack on a Syrian air base among other reasons for the leak, that after a hiatus, it had returned to leaking because it was upset that President Trump was abandoning ''the peoples who getting you elected.''    Among the leaks on Friday was an extensive list of PowerPoint and Excel documents that, if authentic, indicate that the N.S.A. has successfully infiltrated EastNets, a company based in Dubai that helps to manage transactions in the international bank messaging system called Swift.    Swift, short for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is used by about 11,000 banks to transfer money from one country to another. The vast majority of those banks rely on Swift service bureaus, like EastNets, the largest bureau in the Middle East, to handle their transactions. The latest leaks suggest that, by hacking EastNets, the N.S.A. may have successfully hacked, or at minimum targeted, computers inside some of the biggest banks in the Middle East, including ones in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates; Kuwait; Qatar; Syria; Yemen; and the Palestinian territories. Among the leaked documents was a now-patched N.S.A. road map to hacking Swift's back-end infrastructure, which could be used by cybercriminals in the future.   This would not be the first time that United States intelligence agencies have been accused of hacking into Middle Eastern banks. In 2012, security researchers discovered that a computer virus had infiltrated thousands of computers, many inside Lebanese banks. Unlike cybercriminals, who target banks to maximize financial profit, the attackers had monitored the financial transactions of a targeted list of clients of Lebanese banks, which experts said had been used as financial conduits for the Syrian government and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party.   The digital crumbs from that attack suggested, cybersecurity experts said, that the virus was the work of the same attackers behind Stuxnet, the computer attack that destroyed the centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility and that has been attributed to the United States and Israel.   It is also not the first time a country has been accused of infiltrating the Swift banking system. Federal prosecutors are investigating North Korea's possible role in a Swift hack that resulted in the theft of $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh in February 2016. Security researchers found that traces of code used in the Bangladesh theft had been used in a destructive cyberattack against Sony in 2014, which the Obama administration and security experts blamed North Korean hackers for carrying out.   The United States is leading inquiries into North Korea's possible involvement in the Swift theft. If legitimate, the leaks suggesting that the N.S.A. has also infiltrated the Swift system leave the United States in an awkward position.   The N.S.A. did not respond to requests for comment.   The Shadow Brokers first emerged in August, when the group leaked a list of what it said were N.S.A. hacking tools. Initially, some suspected the materials came from an N.S.A. insider gone rogue. But the Shadow Brokers leaks continued even after the F.B.I. arrested an N.S.A. contractor who they believed was stockpiling and potentially leaking the agency's hacking tools.   Another theory, advanced by security experts and even by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who leaked highly classified agency documents and is now living in Russia, is that the Shadow Brokers is a part of the same Russian groups behind the hacking that occurred during the American presidential campaign last year. Some security researchers raised the possibility that the leaks were a warning to American intelligence officials that the Russians had stolen the very tools the American intelligence community could deploy in a counterattack on Russia for its involvement in the pre-election breaches.   The group resumed its leaks after the United States carried out airstrikes targeting Syria, Russia's ally. In a post on April 8, the group said Mr. Trump had abandoned those who helped get him elected. ''The ShadowBrokers is losing faith in you,'' it said, adding, ''Is appearing you are abandoning 'your base,' 'the movement,' and the peoples who getting you elected.''   On Friday, EastNets denied that it had been hacked. In a statement, the company said its Swift service bureau runs on a separate secure network that cannot be reached over the public internet. The company said the leaked documents that claimed its computers had been compromised referred to an old server that the bureau had retired in 2013.   ''While we cannot ascertain the information that has been published, we can confirm that no EastNets customer data has been compromised in any way,'' Hazem Mulhim, EastNets' chief executive, said in the statement.   But the latest Shadow Brokers leak claims otherwise. One Excel spreadsheet lists what appears to be thousands of stolen credentials belonging to compromised employees and technology administrators at EastNets offices around the globe. Another shows a list of what the group said was computer addresses that have been hacked or targeted by N.S.A. analysts, with the corresponding bank they belong to. Among those listed as having been successfully ''implanted,'' or infected with spyware, are Noor Bank, Tadhamon International Islamic Bank, Al Quds Bank for Development and Investment, Arcapita Bank and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.   None of the documents suggest that the N.S.A. used its access to steal funds. Instead, it appears that the agency was seeking to track the financial movements of certain Middle Eastern bank clients, ostensibly to gain insight into potential terrorist groups or government officials.   The Shadow Brokers' latest data release also includes a listing of what seemed to be N.S.A. hacking tools, so-called exploits, that allowed the agency to invisibly break into computers and servers running Microsoft Windows. The exploits appear to affect every recent version of Microsoft Windows except its Windows 10 software.   But in a statement issued on Friday, Microsoft said it had already patched its software to protect users from many of the exploits listed in the leaks. Phillip Misner, Microsoft's principal security group manager, said that of the exploits listed in the Shadow Broker leaks, only three had not been patched, but that none of those three worked on any of Microsoft's supported software, which includes Windows 7 and up.   Technology companies typically credit security researchers who turn over problems in their software. But in a somewhat mysterious departure from that procedure, Microsoft did not say how it had learned of the exploits before their release by the Shadow Brokers on Friday.     "
Macron Denies Access to 2 Russian Media Outlets in French Campaign,"PARIS -- The campaign of the French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron confirmed on Friday that it had denied the pro-Kremlin media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today accreditations to cover the rest of his campaign.  On Sunday, after it became clear that Mr. Macron and Marine Le Pen would face each other in the election runoff on May 7, the news media descended on Macron headquarters. But journalists from RT, Sputnik and Ruptly, a Russian video news agency, were denied access.    Other Russian media outlets were accredited for the event, according to a spokeswoman for the campaign, who said RT and Sputnik were considered ''alternative media'' that produce ''propaganda.''   In a weekly briefing in Moscow on Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria V. Zakharova, described the decision as ''outrageous.'' She said the ''prohibitive measures'' were ''purposeful and blatant discrimination of the Russian media by a candidate to the presidency of a state that historically stood up for freedom of speech.''   Ms. Zakharova said the decision was in line with previous ''unsupported accusations against RT and Sputnik'' made by the Macron campaign, and she called on the French authorities ''to pay special attention to the violation of media rights in the course of the presidential elections.''   The French authorities and security experts have for months warned of the risk of election meddling by Russia, either through slanted or fake news, trumpeted by pro-Kremlin outlets, or through cyberattacks.   It may well be that Mr. Macron's campaign has experienced all of them.   The decision to bar the Russian outlets came on the heels of a report by the cybersecurity firm Trend Micro that Russian operatives had targeted Mr. Macron's campaign. Those operatives have also been linked to the hacking of Democratic Party officials before the presidential election in the United States last November.   In February, Richard Ferrand, the secretary general of Mr. Macron's movement En Marche!, or Onward!, warned that the campaign's databases and websites had been hit by ''hundreds, if not thousands,'' of attacks from inside Russia.   As on most subjects, Ms. Le Pen and Mr. Macron's views on French-Russian relations differ vastly.   Ms. Le Pen, whose earlier presidential bids have been partly financed by Russian loans, has supported lifting sanctions against Moscow that were imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea. She also met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia before the French election.   Mr. Macron, after some wavering, adopted the European Union's position that sanctions could not be lifted until the Minsk agreements, which aimed to resolve the Ukraine crisis, had been fully implemented.

Investigation Into Hacking At Trump's Company,"Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's New York office have been investigating an attempt by international hackers to break into computers at the Trump Organization, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  Early this month, at a meeting at the bureau's offices in Lower Manhattan, some of the agents briefed President Trump's two grown sons, Eric Trump and Donald J. Trump Jr., about the attempted intrusion, the people said. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.    Mr. Trump's sons began running the Trump Organization after their father became president.   A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. declined to comment on the investigation, which was first reported by ABC News, or to comment on the briefing.   Eric Trump confirmed in a telephone interview on Thursday evening that he had spoken with the F.B.I. about matters related to computer security, but declined to elaborate, other than to say there had been no successful intrusion into the company's computer system.   ''We've spoken to them about things totally unrelated to anything that's going on or anything related to a campaign,'' he said.   While one of the people said the hackers had conducted their attack from overseas, it was unclear in which nation it had originated, when it began, how it had been uncovered, and why it had failed.   Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump organization, declined to answer questions about the attempted intrusion or the company's approach to computer security. But she suggested in a statement that it was not the first time the company had been targeted by hackers.   ''Like virtually every other company these days, we are routinely targeted by cyberterrorists whose only focus is to inflict harm on great American businesses,'' the statement said. ''To be clear, the Trump Organization was not hacked. While we will remain vigilant in fighting off any attempts to do so, we are confident in the steps we have taken to protect our businesses and safeguard our information.''   The disclosure that the president's sons were briefed by the F.B.I. on the attempted intrusion in early May comes at an awkward time.   The bureau's agents have been conducting an investigation into whether members of Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with the Russian government's effort to influence the presidential election.   There has been no indication, however, that the investigation into the attempted intrusion at the Trump Organization -- or the briefing agents conducted for Eric Trump and Donald J. Trump Jr. -- was in any way tied to that investigation.   After his election, President Trump said that he could continue to run his family business if he wanted but that he nonetheless would turn the Trump Organization over to his two grown sons.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
China's New Cybersecurity Law Leaves Foreign Companies Guessing,"Follow Sui-Lee Wee on Twitter @suilee. BEIJING -- As China moves to start enforcing a new cybersecurity law, foreign companies face a major problem: They know very little about it. The law -- which was rubber-stamped by the country's Parliament last year -- is part of wide-ranging efforts by Beijing to manage the internet within China's borders. Those efforts have been stepped up in the years since Edward J. Snowden, the whistle-blower and former American intelligence contractor, revealed that foreign technology firms could help governments spy.    And while Chinese officials say the new rules will help guard against cyberattacks and prevent terrorism, critics, many of them from businesses, have their concerns. Companies worry that parts of the new law, which takes effect on Thursday, will make their operations in China less secure or more expensive. In some cases, they argue, it could keep them out entirely.    The law will have a big impact on how business is done in China, said Michael Chang, an executive with the Finnish technology company Nokia and the vice president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. But, he said, ''There's unfortunately a lot of confusion.''   ''Industry is not ready because the implementation rules are not clear,'' Mr. Chang said, speaking at an event organized by the lobbying group to announce the results of its annual business confidence survey.   ''We still have a lot of unclarified territory that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.''   The law would require that companies store their data within China, and would impose security checks on companies in sectors like finance and communications. Individual users, meanwhile, would have to register with their real names to use messaging services.   But Mr. Chang said that officials had conveyed ''less than half'' of the specifics of how the law would be implemented.   ''A wide range of companies are doing data transfers -- it's the lifeblood of their business,'' he said.   Executives have complained that the wording of the law is ambiguous, fearing that it gives China's ruling Communist Party substantial leeway to target them.   One instance cited by Mats Harborn, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, in a round-table discussion with journalists, was that the government said it wanted to regulate ''critical information infrastructure,'' but had not defined what that meant.   ''The way it's enforced and implemented today and the way it might be enforced and implemented in a year is a big question mark,'' added Lance Noble, the chamber's policy and communications manager. He warned that uncertainty surrounding the law could make foreign technology firms reluctant to bring their best innovations to China.   In May, a coalition of business lobby groups representing European, American and Asian companies called on China to delay implementing the law, while the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China asked for additional time to allow companies to adhere because of the ''substantial compliance obligations.''   The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's internet regulator, has so far decided to delay implementation only of the regulations governing cross-border data flow, which will now take effect at the end of 2018, according to a revised draft of the rules that was seen by The New York Times.   The regulator could not be reached despite multiple telephone calls.   Paul Triolo of the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group noted the decision to delay that component of the law, saying in a report last week that ''getting the cross-border data flow issue right is a prerequisite for Beijing's efforts to promote economic globalization.'' He wrote that China, for the time being, ''is eager to avoid being seen as stifling digital trade.''   The European Union and China plan to hold a summit meeting on Thursday in Brussels. Friction between them has mounted after the European Union imposed anti-dumping duties on Beijing, accusing it of flooding the European market with cheap steel.   Many foreign companies are becoming increasingly skeptical of China's promises of economic reform. Mr. Harborn, the lobbying group president, said he expected European officials to complain to Premier Li Keqiang of China about unequal market access in the country for European companies.   The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said that half the members who took part in its annual business confidence survey reported higher sales in China last year, thanks largely to a Chinese government stimulus package in the first half of the year. But 40 percent of respondents said they believed regulatory barriers would increase over the next five years.     "
Why Automakers Are Hiring Security Experts,"It started about seven years ago. Iran's top nuclear scientists were being assassinated in a string of similar attacks: Assailants on motorcycles were pulling up to their moving cars, attaching magnetic bombs and detonating them after the motorcyclists had fled the scene. In another seven years, security experts warn, assassins won't need motorcycles or magnetic bombs. All they'll need is a laptop and code to send driverless cars careering off a bridge, colliding with a driverless truck or coming to an unexpected stop in the middle of fast-moving traffic.    Automakers may call them self-driving cars. But hackers call them computers that travel over 100 miles an hour.   ''These are no longer cars,'' said Marc Rogers, the principal security researcher at the cybersecurity firm CloudFlare. ''These are data centers on wheels. Any part of the car that talks to the outside world is a potential inroad for attackers.''    Those fears came into focus two years ago when two ''white hat'' hackers -- researchers who look for computer vulnerabilities to spot problems and fix them, rather than to commit a crime or cause problems -- successfully gained access to a Jeep Cherokee from their computer miles away. They rendered their crash-test dummy (in this case a nervous reporter) powerless over his vehicle and disabling his transmission in the middle of a highway.   The hackers, Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller (now security researchers respectively at Uber and Didi, an Uber competitor in China), discovered an electronic route from the Jeep's entertainment system to its dashboard. From there, they had control of the vehicle's steering, brakes and transmission -- everything they needed to paralyze their crash test dummy in the middle of a highway.   ''Car hacking makes great headlines, but remember: No one has ever had their car hacked by a bad guy,'' Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter last Sunday. ''It's only ever been performed by researchers.''   Still, the research by Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek came at a steep price for Jeep's manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler, which was forced to recall 1.4 million of its vehicles as a result of the hacking experiment.   It is no wonder that Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, called cybersecurity her company's top priority last year. Now the skills of researchers and so-called white hat hackers are in high demand among automakers and tech companies pushing ahead with driverless car projects.   Uber, Tesla, Apple and Didi in China have been actively recruiting white hat hackers like Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek from one another as well as from traditional cybersecurity firms and academia.   Last year, Tesla poached Aaron Sigel, Apple's manager of security for its iOS operating system. Uber poached Chris Gates, formerly a white hat hacker at Facebook. Didi poached Mr. Miller from Uber, where he had gone to work after the Jeep hack. And security firms have seen dozens of engineers leave their ranks for autonomous-car projects.   Mr. Miller said he left Uber for Didi, in part, because his new Chinese employer has given him more freedom to discuss his work.   ''Carmakers seem to be taking the threat of cyberattack more seriously, but I'd still like to see more transparency from them,'' Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter on Saturday.   Like a number of big tech companies, Tesla and Fiat Chrysler started paying out rewards to hackers who turn over flaws the hackers discover in their systems. GM has done something similar, though critics say GM's program is limited when compared with the ones offered by tech companies, and so far no rewards have been paid out.   One year after the Jeep hack by Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek, they demonstrated all the other ways they could mess with a Jeep driver, including hijacking the vehicle's cruise control, swerving the steering wheel 180 degrees or slamming on the parking brake in high-speed traffic -- all from a computer in the back of the car. (Those exploits ended with their test Jeep in a ditch and calls to a local tow company.)   Granted, they had to be in the Jeep to make all that happen. But it was evidence of what is possible.   The Jeep penetration was preceded by a  2011 hack by security researchers at the University of Washington and the University of California, San Diego, who were the first to remotely hack a sedan and ultimately control its brakes via Bluetooth. The researchers warned car companies that the more connected cars become, the more likely they are to get hacked.   Security researchers have also had their way with Tesla's software-heavy Model S car. In 2015, Mr. Rogers, together with Kevin Mahaffey, the chief technology officer of the cybersecurity company Lookout, found a way to control various Tesla functions from their physically connected laptop.   One year later, a team of Chinese researchers at Tencent took their research a step further, hacking a moving Tesla Model S and controlling its brakes from 12 miles away. Unlike Chrysler, Tesla was able to dispatch a remote patch to fix the security holes that made the hacks possible.   In all the cases, the car hacks were the work of well meaning, white hat security researchers. But the lesson for all automakers was clear.   The motivations to hack vehicles are limitless. When it learned of Mr. Rogers's and Mr. Mahaffey's investigation into Tesla's Model S, a Chinese app-maker asked Mr. Rogers if he would be interested in sharing, or possibly selling, his discovery, he said. (The app maker was looking for a backdoor to secretly install its app on Tesla's dashboard.)   Criminals have not yet shown they have found back doors into connected vehicles, though for years, they have been actively developing, trading and deploying tools that can intercept car key communications.   But as more driverless and semiautonomous cars hit the open roads, they will become a more worthy target. Security experts warn that driverless cars present a far more complex, intriguing and vulnerable ''attack surface'' for hackers. Each new ''connected'' car feature introduces greater complexity, and with complexity inevitably comes vulnerability.   Twenty years ago, cars had, on average, one million lines of code. The General Motors 2010 Chevrolet Volt had about 10 million lines of code -- more than an F-35 fighter jet.   Today, an average car has more than 100 million lines of code. Automakers predict it won't be long before they have 200 million. When you stop to consider that, on average, there are 15 to 50 defects per 1,000 lines of software code, the potentially exploitable weaknesses add up quickly.   The only difference between computer code and driverless car code is that, ''Unlike data center enterprise security -- where the biggest threat is loss of data -- in automotive security, it's loss of life,'' said David Barzilai, a co-founder of Karamba Security, an Israeli start-up that is working on addressing automotive security.   To truly secure autonomous vehicles, security experts say, automakers will have to address the inevitable vulnerabilities that pop up in new sensors and car computers, address inherent vulnerabilities in the base car itself and, perhaps most challenging of all, bridge the cultural divide between automakers and software companies.   ''The genie is out of the bottle, and to solve this problem will require a major cultural shift,'' said Mr. Mahaffey of the cybersecurity company Lookout. ''And an automaker that truly values cybersecurity will treat security vulnerabilities the same they would an airbag recall. We have not seen that industrywide shift yet.''   There will be winners and losers, Mr. Mahaffey added: ''Automakers that transform themselves into software companies will win. Others will get left behind.''     "
Becoming Chelsea Manning,"Matthew Shaer is a contributing writer for the magazine, based in Atlanta. He has written for Harper's, Wired, The Atlantic and Smithsonian magazine, where he is a correspondent. On a gray morning this spring, Chelsea Manning climbed into the back seat of a black S.U.V. and directed her security guard to drive her to the nearest Starbucks. A storm was settling over Manhattan, and Manning was prepared for the weather, in chunky black Doc Martens with an umbrella and a form-fitting black dress. Her legs were bare, her eyes gray blue. She wore little makeup: a spot of eyeliner, a smudge of pink lip gloss. At Starbucks, she ordered a white-chocolate mocha and retreated to a nearby stool. Manning has always been small (5 foot 4), but in her last few months at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, she jogged religiously, outside in the prison yard and around the track of the prison gym, and her body had taken on a lithe sharpness, apparent in the definition of her arms and cheekbones. She looked healthy and fit, if a little uneasy, as people who have served long spells in prison often do.     She had been released only eight days earlier, after serving seven years of a 35-year sentence. Her crime, even in hindsight, was an astonishing one: handing WikiLeaks approximately 250,000 American diplomatic cables and roughly 480,000 Army reports from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Collectively the largest leak of classified records in American history, the disclosures cleared a path for Edward Snowden and elevated the profile of Julian Assange, then little known outside hacker circles. ''Without Chelsea Manning,'' P.J. Crowley, an assistant secretary of state from 2009 to 2011, told me recently, ''Julian Assange is just another fringe actor who resents what he sees as American hegemonic hubris.'' To an extraordinary extent, Manning's actions, in the words of Denver Nicks, the author of a book on her case, represented the ''beginning of the information age exploding upon itself'': a new era in which leaks were a weapon, data security was of paramount importance and privacy felt illusory.   In January 2017, after being locked up at five different facilities, in conditions a United Nations expert called ''cruel'' and ''inhumane,'' Manning had received a surprise commutation by President Barack Obama. Four months later, she was free, trying to adjust to life in a world she helped shape. Finishing her coffee, she fished her iPhone out of her purse and asked her security guard for a lift back to the apartment where she was staying while in Manhattan. The one-bedroom was furnished sparsely, with a wide glass table and a tan couch, opposite which Manning had set up an Xbox One video-game console. The art was of the anodyne motel variety -- an old-masters-esque tableau, a canvas of a zebra standing in a forest. We were many floors up, suspended in the storm clouds, and through the window, I could see the spires of the skyscrapers on the other side of the Hudson River.   Manning, who is 29, tapped an unplugged microwave next to the door and asked me to place my laptop inside: The Faraday cage in the microwave would block radio waves, she explained. But the unplugged microwave was already full of devices, including two Xbox controllers. ''You can put it in the kitchen microwave,'' Manning said; then, intuiting the strangeness of the request, she added with a shrug, ''You can't be too careful.''   She recalled that she last gave an in-person, on-the-record interview to a journalist in 2008, on the occasion of a marriage-equality march in New York. For almost a decade after that, barred by prison officials from communicating directly with the public, she remained silent as her story was told in books, an opera, an Off Broadway play and countless magazine articles, almost all of them written before Manning had come out as transgender. ''It wasn't the whole story,'' she told me, ''my whole story.''   Absent her own voice, a pair of dueling narratives had emerged. One had Manning, in the words of President Donald Trump, as an ''ungrateful traitor.'' The other positioned her as transgender icon and champion of transparency -- a ''secular martyr,'' as Chase Madar, a former attorney and the author of a book on her case, recently put it to me. But in Manning's presence, both narratives feel like impossible simplifications, not least because Manning herself is clearly still grappling with the meaning of what she did seven years ago. When I asked her to draw lessons from her journey, she grew uneasy. ''I don't have. ... '' she started. ''Like, I've been so busy trying to survive for the past seven years that I haven't focused on that at all.''   But surely, I pressed, she must have some sense of the impact she had on the world. ''From my perspective,'' she responded, ''the world's shaped me more than anything else. It's a feedback loop.''   As far back as Chelsea Manning can remember, to her earliest days in Crescent, on the far edge of the Oklahoma City metro area, she suffered from a feeling of intense dislocation, something constant and psychic that she struggled to define to herself, much less to her older sister, Casey, or her parents, Brian and Susan. During one of our interviews, I mentioned that I heard a clinical psychologist compare gender dysphoria to a ''giant, cosmic toothache.'' Manning flushed. That was it exactly, she agreed: ''Morning, evening, breakfast, lunch, dinner, wherever you are. It's everywhere you go.''   At the age of 5, Manning recalled, she approached her father, an I.T. manager for Hertz, and confessed that she wanted to be a girl, ''to do girl things.'' Brian responded with a lengthy and awkward speech on the essential differences in ''plumbing.'' But Manning told me, ''I didn't understand how that had anything to do with what you wore or how you behaved.'' Soon she was sneaking into her sister's bedroom and donning Casey's acid-washed jeans and denim jackets. Seated at the mirror, she would apply lipstick and blush, frantically scrubbing off the makeup at the slightest stirring from downstairs.   ''I wanted to be like [Casey] and live like her,'' Manning said.   When she was still in elementary school, she came out as gay to a straight male friend. The friend was understanding; the other kids at school, less so. Manning tried, unsuccessfully, to retract her confession, but the teasing continued. ''I would come home crying some days, and if my dad was there, he'd say: 'Just quit crying and man up. Like, go back there and punch that kid in the face,' '' she said. It was the late 1990s, when the trans movement was very much on the fringes of American society. ''The closest I came to knowing anything was from the portrayal of drag-queen-style cross-dressing on sensational TV shows'' like Jerry Springer's, Manning told me. She spent more time inside, on the computers that her father was always bringing home, playing video games and dabbling in basic code.   Her parents had issues of their own. When Manning was about 12, Susan swallowed an entire bottle of Valium. Casey called 911, only to be told that the nearest ambulance was a half-hour away. Casey loaded her mother into the car; Brian, who Manning says was too drunk to drive, sat shotgun, leaving a terrified Chelsea in the back to make sure her mother kept breathing. She told me the incident was formational. ''I grew up very quickly after that,'' she said. (Brian could not be reached for comment.)   In Susan's native Wales, where Manning moved with her in 2001 after her parents split, Chelsea says she took over full control of the household, paying bills and handling much of the shopping. There was freedom there, too: She could buy her own makeup at the convenience store, wear it for a few hours in public and jam it into a waste bin on her way home. She passed many evenings on her computer, in L.G.B.T. chat rooms. Her worldview shifted. While in Crescent, Manning had imbibed her father's conservative politics -- ''I questioned nothing,'' she told me. But at Tasker Milward, a school in the town of Haverfordwest, she studied the civil rights movement, the Red Scare, the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. In a term paper for a history class, she expressed skepticism about the rationale for the American invasion of Iraq.   When Manning returned to the United States in 2005 to live with Brian and his new wife in Oklahoma City, she was a changed person, if not a wholly transformed one: She wore eyeliner and grew out her hair and dyed it black. ''I thought, Maybe I want to just eradicate this gender thing and be gender neutral, like androgynous,'' she told me. She found a job at an internet start-up and, through a matchmaking site, met her first boyfriend, who lived 70 miles away in the town of Duncan. But her stepmother, Manning said, forbade her from setting foot in the kitchen: ''She felt that I was unclean.''   Manning confided to no one what she was increasingly coming to understand: that she wasn't gay, wasn't a cross-dresser. She was a woman. In the summer of 2006, she and her boyfriend parted ways, and she lit out from Oklahoma for good, all her belongings piled high in the cab of her red Nissan pickup truck. A spell of itinerancy followed -- out to Tulsa, Okla., to work at a pizza parlor; up to Chicago to work at Guitar Center; east to the suburbs of Washington to live with her aunt, with whom she enjoyed a connection she never shared with her parents. She did four sessions with a psychologist, but got no closer to unburdening herself than she had with friends or family members. ''I was scared,'' Manning said. ''I didn't know that life could be better.''   Brian Manning had often fondly recounted for Chelsea his days in the military: It had given him structure and grounding, he said. Manning hadn't been ready to listen then. Now she was. Enlisting might be the thing to ''man her up,'' to rid her of the ache. Besides, while her ideas about American foreign policy had become more nuanced, she still considered herself a patriot -- in the Army, she could use her analytical skills to help her country. ''I remember sitting in the summer of 2007 and just every single day turning on the TV'' and seeing the news from Iraq, she told me. ''The surge, the surge, the surge. Terrorist attacks. Insurgents. ... I just felt like maybe I could make a difference.''   That fall, Manning reported for basic training at Fort Leonard Wood in the Missouri Ozarks; within a few days, she had suffered injuries to her arm. ''The drill sergeants were acting like I was malingering or something,'' she said. ''But I was like: 'No, I'm not trying to get out of anything. I just really can't feel my right hand.' '' A soldier who spent time with Manning in Missouri later recalled for The Guardian that Manning was routinely called a ''faggot.'' ''The guy took it from every side. He couldn't please anyone. And he tried. He really did,'' the soldier said.   The Army, in need of more bodies to fight the insurgencies in Afghanistan and Iraq, allowed Manning another shot at boot camp. In 2008, she graduated to intelligence school at Fort Huachuca in Arizona, which to her felt like a kind of community college. There, she was trained to sort what the military terms ''SigActs,'' or significant actions -- the written reports, photos and videos of the confrontations, explosions and firefights that form the mosaic of modern war. Manning told me she fit in well with the intelligence types at Fort Huachuca, who shared her intrinsic geekiness. ''There were more like-minded people there,'' she said, adding, ''It wasn't 'Rah, rah, you need to do this.' They encouraged us to speak up. They encouraged us to have opinions, to make our own decisions.''   At her first official duty station, Fort Drum in upstate New York, Manning was charged in part with helping to build a digital tool that would automatically track and sort SigActs from Afghanistan, where Manning's unit initially expected to be deployed. For hours a day, she watched spectral night-vision video and read reports from distant battlefields. Already, she was being exposed to the bloodshed that would serve as inspiration for her leaks. But she was handling the material at a spatial and emotional reserve: She remained, she told me, ''eager'' to get to the front lines. ''I was hungry.''   Through a gay dating site, she met a bookish Brandeis student named Tyler Watkins. She started driving to visit Watkins in the Boston area, where she became a regular at Pika, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology co-op, and visited Boston University's Builds, a hub of the local hacking community. At the Pika gatherings, she found friends that approached coding the same way she did: as outlet, pastime and calling. She often stayed up late into the night talking. Yan Zhu, then an undergraduate student at M.I.T., remembers Manning as ''obviously intelligent,'' if ''nervous.'' It was clear to Zhu that Manning was ''haunted by something.'' But she never had a chance to find out what: That fall, Manning's unit was deployed to Iraq.   In October 2009, Manning hopped a Black Hawk from Baghdad to Forward Operating Base Hammer, 30 miles east of the city. In the cabin, strapped into the chopper's jump seats, she began putting names to places that had long been digital abstractions. ''I had seen imagery for nine or 10 months prior,'' Manning recalled, ''I knew the landscape so well from the air that I recognized these neighborhoods, and it woke me up to see people walking around and to see people driving and to see the buildings and the trees below.''   Ringed by desert, the low-slung buildings of F.O.B. Hammer baked in the summer and coursed with mud in the fall. Every night, Manning rose from her bunk at 9 p.m., dressed in standard-issue visual camouflage and grabbed her rifle. After quickly eating dinner for breakfast, she walked to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, to report for duty. Manning's SCIF was a glorified ''plywood box'' with lousy airflow, situated on a basketball court. She sat at the free-throw line, in a reclining office chair, where she spent her overnight shift facing three laptop computers. Manning's isolation took on a new form: Hidden away in the darkened SCIF, she would work for eight hours at a stretch, sifting through reports filed securely by American troops in the field, making sense of the raw data for senior-level intelligence officers. She remained sealed off from actual conflict, though she could hear the shudder of car bombs and sometimes ran into soldiers, dazed and dusty, on their way back from a firefight.   At that early juncture, Manning told me, she was too busy to give much thought to the larger import of what she was seeing. ''Doing my job, you couldn't even really read all the files,'' she said. ''You have to skim, get a sense of what's relevant and what's not.'' Still, to an extraordinary extent, she had a more comprehensive view of America's role in Iraq than the infantry in the field did -- often, literally, a sky-level view -- and as October ground into November, she found herself increasingly dismayed by a lack of public awareness about what seemed to be a futile, ceaselessly bloody war. ''At a certain point,'' she told me, ''I stopped seeing records and started seeing people'': bloody American soldiers, bullet-ridden Iraqi civilians.   On rare reprieves from the SCIF, Manning accompanied senior officers to meetings with the Iraqi military and the Iraqi federal police, sit-downs that further entrenched her disillusionment. ''There would be these tea sessions, where you've got the Iraqi federal police in their blue uniforms, you've got Iraqi Army in, like, the old chocolate-chip camouflage and the Americans in our smeared green digital camouflage,'' Manning said -- everyone speaking in different languages, frequently at cross-purposes. ''I'd come in thinking things would be black and white. They weren't.''   Manning told me she heard the name WikiLeaks for the first time in 2008, at a computer security training course at Fort Huachuca. By the end of 2009, she had started logging on to internet relay chat conversations devoted to the site. (I.R.C., a semisecure protocol, was then the preferred method of communication for hackers.) Initially, she was an observer: She was intrigued by the work that Julian Assange and his team were doing, if not quite ready to endorse their argument for total transparency. She told me that she believed then, and believes now, that ''there are plenty of things that should be kept secret.'' ''Let's protect sensitive sources. Let's protect troop movements. Let's protect nuclear information. Let's not hide missteps. Let's not hide misguided policies. Let's not hide history. Let's not hide who we are and what we are doing.''   She was edging closer to acting but said nothing about the I.R.C. channel to her friends at F.O.B. Hammer, nor about her own personal tumult. She was now fighting to keep what amounted to two life-altering secrets. She couldn't discuss her identity openly: The ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy was still in effect, and it would be years before transgender people were allowed to openly enlist. ''I binge watched TV shows on the internet,'' she said. ''I was smoking heavily. I was drinking an enormous amount of caffeine. I was going to the dining facility and eating as much as I could. Just any little tiny escape or way to feel like I'm not there anymore.'' Her boyfriend was little help: Manning could feel him slipping away. ''I was in denial about it, but I had a sense ... that I was being forgotten,'' she told me.   Manning had a two-week leave coming up. She planned to spend time in Boston, trying to patch things up with Watkins, and in the suburbs of Washington with her aunt. She dreamed about using the occasion to come out to her family and friends as trans. ''I kept having this moment in my head,'' she told me, ''where I just yell it at the top of my lungs.'' But she knew, in her heart, that she'd never be able to go through with it.   Before leaving F.O.B. Hammer, Manning downloaded, from the government's Combined Information Data Network Exchange, almost every SigActs report from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and burned a compressed version of the data onto CD-RW discs, one of which was labeled ''Lady Gaga.'' She did it in full view of her fellow soldiers. But what she did next violated the most important precepts she was taught at Fort Huachuca, along with the Oath of Enlistment she swore in 2007: She uploaded the contents of the discs onto the personal laptop she planned to take home to the United States. She had not decided what she would do with the data.   Days later, Manning put on a blond wig and ran in a low crouch from the side door of her aunt's house, out of view of the neighbors, and drove to the train station. She wore a dark coat and, under it, business-casual woman's wear she bought at a local department store; she claimed it was for her friend who needed it for a job interview. In Washington, she went to a Starbucks, ate lunch at a busy restaurant and wandered through the aisles of a bookstore; later, she climbed back on the Metro and rode it aimlessly around. She took great pleasure in being seen as she knew she was and comfort in how easily she passed -- rarely did anyone give her a second glance.   ''Before I deployed, I didn't have the guts,'' Manning, who was then privately referring to herself as Brianna, told me. But her time in Iraq was changing her. ''Being exposed to so much death on a daily basis makes you grapple with your own mortality,'' she went on. She no longer wanted to hide.   The expedition was the high point of a disappointing two-week leave. The Army had bumped up her departure from F.O.B. Hammer, and her family hadn't had time to readjust their schedules: Manning's aunt was on a trip abroad, and her sister had just had her first child -- it would be tricky to carve out time for Chelsea. Manning took a train up to see Watkins at his home in Waltham, in Massachusetts, but she couldn't shake the feeling that he didn't really want her there, so she cut her stay short by three days.   At that point, it would have been possible for Manning to return to Iraq with the files unshared -- her actions had been illegal, if reversible. But Manning told me that being in the United States had prompted an epiphany. At home, she says, she realized how invisible the wars had become to most civilians, whose awareness of Iraq extended as far as the occasional newspaper article or chyron on cable news. ''There were two worlds,'' she said. ''The world in America, and the world I was seeing [in Iraq],'' She went on, ''I wanted people to see what I was seeing.''   A blizzard hit Washington. Manning's aunt still wasn't back from vacation. Alone, Manning transferred parts of the files to a small memory card and prepared an anonymous text file she wanted to accompany the information. ''This is possibly one of the more significant documents of our time removing the fog of war and revealing the true nature of twenty-first century asymmetric warfare,'' she wrote. ''Have a good day.''   Manning told me her decision to provide the information to WikiLeaks was a practical one: She originally planned to deliver the data to The New York Times or The Washington Post, and for the last week of her leave, she dodged from public phone to public phone, calling the main office lines for both papers, leaving a message for the public editor at The Times and engaging in a frustrating conversation with a Post writer, who said she would have to know more about the files before her editor would sign off on an article. A hastily arranged meeting with Politico, where she hoped to introduce herself to the site's security bloggers, was scrapped because of bad weather. ''I wanted to try to establish a contact in a way that it couldn't be traced to me,'' Manning told me. But she was running out of time. She describes a clearheaded sense of purpose coming over her: ''I needed to do something,'' she told me. ''And I didn't want anything to stop that.''   On Feb. 3, 2010, Manning signed onto her laptop and, using a secure file-transfer protocol, sent the files to WikiLeaks.   Back at F.O.B. Hammer, time sped up; everything seemed to be happening at once. Manning had been away two full weeks, and there was a lot to catch up on -- ''I had to triple my work,'' Manning told me. There had been no sign that WikiLeaks received her files, nor any indication that the Army knew anything was amiss. She remembers being in a perpetual state of heightened anxiety. She slept less, smoked more.   In mid-February, on break from the SCIF, she noticed an interesting thread on the WikiLeaks I.R.C. channel, where participants were discussing the financial crisis in Iceland -- a collapse that Manning, reading through the library of secure diplomatic cables available to her as an analyst, concluded was roiling onward because of the inaction of the United States and what she described as diplomatic bullying by the Netherlands and Britain. ''From my perspective, it appeared that we were not getting involved due to the lack of long-term geopolitical benefit to do so,'' she would later testify. Following the same steps as before, she leaked several diplomatic cables pertaining to the Iceland crisis to WikiLeaks; this time, within hours, WikiLeaks published the documents. Manning was thrilled: If the cables had reached WikiLeaks, the much larger leak of SigActs had almost certainly made it, too.   Around this time, Manning had several I.R.C. conversations with a person whom Manning identified in her online address book as ''Nathaniel Frank,'' after the author of the book ''Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America.'' Frank was almost certainly Assange, although Manning declined to discuss the matter with me -- the bulk of the chats are classified and could be used in future legal actions against Assange.   Manning followed the transmissions of the SigActs and the Iceland cables with a leak that was harder to ignore. Published by WikiLeaks under the title ''Collateral Murder,'' the three-year-old video, captured by a camera mounted on an American helicopter, showed two gunships approaching a group of men in an area where there had been reports of small-arms fire. The helicopter crew repeatedly requests permission to engage -- ''Let us shoot!'' a voice is heard saying -- before receiving it and opening fire. In total, at least a dozen people were killed in the 2007 strike, including several civilians and two staff members of the Reuters news agency. Manning says she knew that Reuters, under the Freedom of Information Act, had asked the United States government for a copy of the video but never received it. This was symptomatic, she said, of the worst impulses of a government obsessed with blanket classification. ''It makes sense to keep some information secret for a few days, maybe a few years,'' she told me. ''The problem is, more and more, everything is secret by default.''   In long chat threads, Manning's relationship with Nathaniel Frank deepened. She warmed to the role of truth-teller, handing over a small library of Detainee Assessment Briefs, or D.A.B.s, from the American holding facility at Guantánamo Bay. ''Living such an opaque life, has forced me never to take transparency, openness and honesty for granted,'' she wrote the former hacker Adrian Lamo, whom Manning had reached out to as a confessor and who was, unknown to Manning, already working with government investigators.   Privately, however, she was coming apart. Army investigators looking into her case would later detail several episodes of what they termed ''bizarre behavior,'' including blank stares and an incident in which Manning was found on the floor of a supply room, having carved the words ''I WANT'' into a nearby chair. She recalled that the unit, as a whole, was ''on edge,'' breaking out into verbal arguments and brawls. Their deployment was coming to an end, ''and that's when people start getting sick of each other and the personal animosity breaks out.''   In April, Manning emailed an Army superior a photo of her as Brianna that she took in Washington while on leave. ''Now I knew who I was,'' Manning told me. ''But the people I'm around the most didn't.'' She titled the email ''My Problem.'' The issue of her gender identity was ''not going away,'' she wrote. ''Now, the consequences of it are dire.'' (Manning said her captain confirmed receipt of the email but ''swept it under the rug.'')   Manning told me that she had resolved, in May, to go public with her role as whistle-blower, even as she was wrestling with how to express her gender identity. She was never able to settle on an approach. At the end of May, she was summoned to a conference room, where two agents from the Army Criminal Investigation Division were waiting. Manning was terrified, but she tried not to show it: ''I was focused inward at that time: who I am, what my values are,'' she recalled. She retreated ''inside [her] head.'' Days later, she was shackled, flown to Camp Arfijan in Kuwait and locked in a large steel cage. Kneeling down, she read the engraved words on the bars: Made in Fort Wayne.   Seven years later, it remains difficult to overstate the impact of the Afghan and Iraq war logs, or the later publication of the diplomatic cables. ''The material touched on virtually every relationship the United States had around the world,'' Crowley, the former State Department official, says of the cables. Repercussions came swiftly: Carlos Pascual, the United States ambassador to Mexico, resigned over cables in which he cast doubt on the effectiveness of the Mexican war on drugs, a revelation that poisoned Pascual's relationship with the Mexican president. Ambassador Gene Cretz was recalled from Libya after his cables detailed the peculiar workings of the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, including a squad of female Ukrainian bodyguards. The release of cables regarding the Tunisian strongman Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali are often credited with helping to inspire the uprising in that country.   The Afghan and Iraq documents brought home, in exactly the way that Manning had hoped, the messiness of the two conflicts. The Guardian wrote in an introduction that the release of the material from Afghanistan revealed a war in stark contrast with the ''tidied up and sanitized 'public' war, as glimpsed through official communiqués as well as the necessarily limited snapshots of embedded reporting.''   American officials, caught off guard by the leaks, were furious. Elizabeth Dibble, a State Department official, later testified that the release of the cables prompted ''horror and disbelief that our diplomatic communications had been released and were available on public websites for the world to see.''   The issue of whether American interests had been adversely affected by the release of the cables remains a charged one. In the full text of the Afghan war logs that appeared on the WikiLeaks site, Julian Assange made only partial redactions, leaving intact the names of some of the Afghans who had collaborated with coalition forces. (He showed what CNN later described as a ''much heavier hand in redacting'' names from the Iraq war logs.) In 2010, Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said that ''we know for a fact that people will likely be killed because of this information being disclosed.'' Subsequent reviews by The Associated Press and McClatchy found this risk to be ''overstated,'' and at Manning's sentencing, government witnesses testified that no American deaths could be attributed to the leaks. Still, Crowley said, a lack of evidence of fatalities was not the same thing as a lack of damage: ''She burned a number of intelligence sources,'' he said. ''She placed Afghans in danger who were telling us what the Taliban was doing in their villages.''   In her cage in Kuwait, Manning registered none of the fallout. ''I was completely isolated,'' she said. At a certain point, she concluded, ''I've been forgotten about, and I've just disappeared.'' She figured that Lamo had turned her in, but she wasn't sure if word of her involvement in the leaks had been made public. It was the start of the hot season in Kuwait, and dust swirled in from outside, lodging in her teeth. Her only human contact was with the guards who brought her meals. ''I had told the detention center when I got there that I was trans,'' Manning told me. '' 'I'm a woman,' I said matter-of-factly. They laughed.'' In utter isolation, Manning found herself consumed with rage and sadness. Officials observed what Manning's attorney called an episode of ''yelling uncontrollably, screaming, shaking, babbling, banging your head against your cell and mumbling.''   Manning told me: ''I was afraid I was going to be in that little cell or something like that little cell for the rest of my life. And that bad things were going to happen to me.'' After a week, she fashioned a noose from bedclothes and made what she told me was a ''halfhearted attempt'' at suicide. ''I kind of knew it wasn't going to work.'' It got the staff's attention, and according to a medical evaluation later obtained by Manning's legal team, a military doctor would diagnose anxiety, depression and ''probable gender identity disorder.'' She was given an antidepressant, which made her nose bleed and caused serious nausea. She couldn't eat. Her skin eventually turned sallow. In late July, four days after the Afghan logs appeared in The Guardian and other papers, Manning was shackled and loaded onto a chartered military flight. She said that previously, guards had told her she would be ''whisked away to a Navy cruiser'' for months; now her escorts said she was going to Guantánamo. Halfway through the flight, the story changed a final time: She was going to the brig at the Marine base at Quantico, in Virginia.   It was there, on arrival, that she learned the world knew who she was. ''So you're Manning!'' a heavyset Marine said with unnerving enthusiasm. Manning was all over Fox News, he added. In transferring Manning to Quantico, the government said it was providing Manning with facilities better suited to her fractured mental state. But a 2011 military investigation, undertaken in part as a response to Manning's treatment, would reveal the opposite: At Quantico, Manning spent 23 hours a day in a 6-by-8-foot cell, for nearly nine months, much of it on Prevention of Injury, or P.O.I., status, in conditions that a United Nations special rapporteur later said could qualify as torture. While on P.O.I. watch, Manning wore what's known as a ''suicide smock,'' a white nylon garment that is all but impossible to twist or rip into a noose. She had no pillow, no sheets. She was required to give regular verbal confirmation during the day that she was O.K. (After the investigation, the military ordered that Quantico's whole pretrial confinement area be shut down.)   When I asked Manning this spring to describe those conditions, she answered in the present tense. ''Emotions can be more intense,'' she said. ''There isn't any release for them. A mean comment by a guard'' -- commonly a gibe about her gender -- ''can set you off. Completely off. I know I have stood in a cell at times, locked down with nowhere to go, pacing with anger and frustration. It just stews inside of you, and you're helpless,'' she went on. ''I just start yelling, at no one in particular, or singing at the top of my lungs.''   But Manning could occasionally receive outside visitors, and her aunt came to the brig. ''Even though it was behind a Plexiglas window and we couldn't talk without recording equipment around,'' Manning told me, ''it was one of the most powerful meetings I'd ever had.'' They whispered to each other. ''We love you,'' her aunt told her. ''We miss you.'' They made plans to hire an independent attorney, eventually selecting David Coombs, a forceful lawyer in his early 40s who had served more than a decade in the Army's Judge Advocate General's Corps.   Word of Manning's treatment in Kuwait and Quantico had begun to filter out, reaching legal eminences like Laurence Tribe and Kwame Anthony Appiah, who signed an open letter criticizing what they described as ''conditions that are illegal and immoral.'' In the spring of 2011, the government transferred Manning again, this time to the Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth. In Kansas, she was released into general population; it was, Manning recalled, ''an utter shock to the system, because I had been in shackles everywhere I went or in a small room or a cage.''   At the facility, inmates weren't required to work, so she spent her time in the library, helping Coombs and his assistants prepare her case. She faced a staggering number of violations, 22 in all, from circumventing security mechanisms to aiding the enemy, an offense that carried with it the possibility of life in prison. For two months that spring, with Manning moved to a civilian prison outside Fort Meade, in Maryland, Coombs sparred with government lawyers, highlighting what he termed the general ''lawlessness'' of Manning's unit and the poor security protocols in place in her SCIF. He eventually argued that Manning's gender dysphoria -- and the inability of the Army to provide treatment -- might have affected Manning's mental capacity and judgment. A few days later, the judge found Manning guilty on all but two counts. Manning was spared a conviction for aiding the enemy and avoided a life sentence. Manning told me that she was relieved, and not only for the obvious reasons: She worried that an aiding-the-enemy charge would set a frightening precedent for the prosecution of whistle-blowers. ''I still worry about how that charge can be misused,'' Manning said.   She herself had resolved not to make her own gender identity public during the court-martial, worried that it would complicate an already unwieldy trial. But listening to the testimony of Lauren McNamara, a transgender friend who testified at the sentencing hearing, she found she had reached a breaking point. ''I was tired of pretending,'' she told me. She wrote a statement identifying herself as Chelsea, a name she used as a child for her handle on the Sims video game. On Aug. 22, David Coombs appeared on NBC's ''Today'' show. The co-host Savannah Guthrie read from the statement: ''As I transition into the next phase of my life, I want everyone to know the real me. I am Chelsea Manning. I am female.'' Manning didn't see the segment or the reaction to it. She was on a plane, on her way to the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth.   The U.S.D.B. lies at the far northern end of Fort Leavenworth, not far from the headquarters of the 40th Military Police Internment and Resettlement Battalion. The maximum-security complex, with its 515 beds, is reserved for the military prisoners serving the longest sentences, housing offenders like Robert Bales, the Army staff sergeant convicted in 2013 of slaughtering 16 Afghan civilians. For almost the entirety of her time there, Manning lived on the second floor. Her cell was narrow and small; there was a cot, a toilet, a mirror and a sink. The one window faced north, affording her a view of the surrounding landscape. In the vacuum of prison, the weather became theater: The snow that piled up against the cyclone fencing. The forked lightning that spidered the sky, sending deer and rabbits skittering for cover.   At Manning's court-martial, Coombs had introduced as evidence the photo his client emailed to a superior in 2010. The image was later distributed to the news media, and by the fall of 2013, it had appeared alongside hundreds of articles on Manning's transition. To Manning, the idea that it should come to define her was painful. ''It was just so far from her experience at Leavenworth,'' Evan Greer, a trans activist and friend, told me. ''And I think some people saw that image, that luscious wig, and figured she was given that kind of freedom behind bars.''   In reality, every aspect of Manning's appearance was being governed by Army rules, from her briefs to her hair, which she was required to wear, per Section 670-1 of Army regulations, in a ''neat and conservative style.'' Manning was in a position that can be difficult for non-trans people to understand: She had come out as female but was still being addressed and treated as if she were male -- often pointedly, by the Leavenworth staff. Vincent Ward, one of Manning's attorneys, recalls observing the way the prison guards treated his client. Ward, a former military lawyer, said he knew ''who these people were. I knew the personality types. From the minute that you walked in, you could sense the bullying, the smirks, the comments.'' It is a kind of isolation that can induce drastic action: Clinical psychologists who work with trans prisoners have documented high levels of suicide and depression in inmates not given appropriate medical treatment. In worst-case scenarios, prisoners have tried to alter their own genitalia by hand.   To friends and the members of her legal team, Manning spoke regularly, and with despair, of feeling ''poisoned'' by the testosterone in her body and of a ghostlike invisibility: If people couldn't see her as she actually was, what use was living? On entering the U.S.D.B. in 2013, Manning requested access to the regimen of estrogen and anti-androgen drugs prescribed to people undergoing a male-to-female transition. She was refused: The Army did not yet sanction hormone therapy for soldiers, let alone for prisoners. Manning's treatment would be limited to antidepressants and counseling sessions with a psychotherapist. ''Permitting Mr. Manning to live as female, much less begin to feminize his body, will create operational challenges as the inmate population respond to these changes,'' prison administrators wrote in an internal memo later obtained by the A.C.L.U.   The prison was unbending in its stance for nearly a year. Meanwhile, one of Manning's lawyers -- Chase Strangio, who himself is trans -- grew increasingly worried that his client might try to hurt herself again; eventually, he filed a lawsuit against the Department of Defense. The suit cited a clinical evaluation from the psychologist Randi Ettner and said Manning was ''experiencing significant distress and is at high risk for serious medical consequences, including self-castration and suicide.'' In the summer of 2014, the Army agreed to send women's underwear to Manning's cell -- a first for any branch of the military. (A civilian judge in Leavenworth County had granted Manning's request to change the name on her birth certificate to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning.) Hormone therapy followed in early 2015, with the drugs distributed in pill form from a medical dispensary near the cafeteria.   To Manning, the early stages of hormone therapy were deeply fulfilling: her skin softened, her body hair thinned. But with the welcome physical changes came unnerving intellectual ones. ''I'd built all these defenses and walls around my emotions over the years, since being a teenager,'' Manning told me. ''When my testosterone levels plummeted, I suddenly became more vulnerable emotionally. I could no longer just hide my emotions: I had to deal with them, usually right there and then.'' And the emotions often came faster than Manning could process: ''Good ones, like confidence, and a sense of connection with my friends, mixed in with a lot of bad ones, like doubt, loneliness, uncertainty and loss.'' For support, Manning spoke regularly to others in the trans community: Strangio and Annie Danger, a trans artist and activist. Danger listened as Manning experimented with her voice, ''putting it in different pitches in an effort to find out what felt right,'' Danger told me. ''I tried to talk her through that searching process, that evolutionary process, which can be so important. You're literally finding your voice.''   At the U.S.D.B., Manning's days took on a mundane, lulling rhythm. Most mornings, she woke up at 4:30 a.m. and, shrugging off the green sheets, dressed in the light of the bare bulb that hung above her bed: the white sports bra; the oversize prison uniform that hung, scarecrow-like, off her thin frame; the Army-issue boots. ''O.K.,'' she would say, examining herself in the mirror. ''You can do this.'' After a quick breakfast in the cafeteria, it was down to the prison wood shop, where she and a crew of inmates built, from scratch, the furniture sold at the base commissary. On the invitation of another prisoner, she joined a weekly Dungeons & Dragons game, playing as Esvele Dundragon, a female noble.   Manning told me that even as she transitioned, she never felt physically threatened by the other prisoners, as she did the staff. ''Of all the people in my entire experience'' in government custody, she said, the ones ''who have been consistently good to me were the other inmates -- like, I'm not saying they were excited or happy or approved of me or anything.'' Manning says she counted a handful of inmates among her close friends, among them Clint Lorance, an Army platoon leader convicted of second-degree murder for ordering his men to open fire on three unarmed Afghan civilians. ''Remember that all these folks were active military before they were incarcerated,'' David Hammond, a lawyer assigned to Manning by the Army's Defense Appellate Division, said in describing the dynamic to me. ''The discipline carries over.''   In April 2014, the Army denied Manning's clemency application, choosing to uphold, in full, her 35-year sentence. There remained the distant possibility of a presidential pardon or commutation, but Manning had no reason to expect one: The White House had condemned the leaks, as had the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. The best option, Manning knew, lay in the formal appeal. But Manning's fight with the prison authorities was grinding into its third year, and she was tired. Her hair was still being cut to male standards. The guards were relentless. ''If you were trying to get them to be more gender neutral, they would make a point of being very gender specific,'' Manning said. And a request for gender reassignment surgery had been met with silence. (According to Manning's lawyers, the Army approved the surgery last September, but set no timeline for its completion.) The U.S.D.B., in her mind, was ''creating, often deliberately and knowingly, situations that cause high levels of stress on any given number of people. This breaks people down. Good people break down.''   In July 2016, one of Manning's closest friends at the U.S.D.B., Anthony Raby, was seated at a bench in the embroidery shop, sewing name tapes for Army recruits, when a fellow prisoner dropped a note onto his table. ''It's from your girlfriend,'' the man said. Raby didn't have to ask who the man was referring to.   A former Army specialist serving three decades for the rape of a young child, Raby had first met Manning in 2013, shortly after her arrival at the U.S.D.B. It was his first encounter with a transgender person; he recalls thinking Manning resembled a ''sad, strange little man.'' In a letter from the U.S.D.B., Raby wrote: ''The idea that someone could believe they were a gender other than what they were born was akin to believing a chicken was a hat. I just didn't understand. However, as a Christian, I fully believe in showing everyone love and compassion, so we talked.''   Raby admired Manning's intelligence, her wit, her unapologetic weirdness. ''I'm all right with the weird,'' Raby wrote. Manning visited his cell frequently to talk or vent or cry -- taking care not to stay too long and violate the prison policy of one person to a unit. Raby, more than anyone else at the U.S.D.B., seemed to understand the toll that incarceration was taking on Manning. ''Prison isn't the best place for anyone who actually has actual emotions besides hate, anger, bitterness, apathy or indifference,'' he wrote.   Now his worst fears were confirmed. Unfolding the note, which was folded and sealed shut with spare adhesive from a stamp book, Raby read the header: ''Chelsea E. Manning, re: My Final Letter.'' He scanned the first page. Manning wrote that she would kill herself after the base's Fourth of July fireworks display came to a close. The fireworks had ended at 10 p.m. It was already 12:25 a.m.   Raby notified a guard in the embroidery shop and handed over Manning's letter. ''About 1 a.m., I heard an announcement over the guard's radio about an alert in Manning's housing unit,'' Raby told me. ''I was pacing like a madman, sure they had not gotten to her in time.'' Not wanting to aggravate the staff, Raby struggled to keep his composure. Around 3:30 a.m., he was approached by an Army investigator: Manning was alive.   Officials have declined to provide details about the incident, and Manning told me she only remembers waking up in an ambulance. But people with knowledge of the situation said Manning tried to hang herself and was recovered by guards, breathing but unresponsive. Manning told me that in the days leading up to the suicide attempt, she felt unusually low and alone. She had been determined to push through to the end of the long weekend, when her psychologist would be back on base. ''I didn't make it,'' she said.   In early September, she embarked on a hunger strike to protest what she called the ''constant and overzealous administrative scrutiny by prison and military officials.'' She ended the hunger strike when the prison vowed to provide her with gender-reassignment surgery, an unprecedented accommodation.   By the end of September, Manning was sentenced to an additional two weeks in solitary, with one week suspended. Her crime was conduct that threatens the orderly running of the barracks -- her suicide attempt.   If prison, as Manning has said, made her feel like a ghost -- alive in her supporters' thoughts but unable to be with them physically -- then her time in solitary was akin to erasure. Isolation ''changes you; it makes you angry,'' she said. ''You start to forget about the world outside -- it's not relevant or relatable anymore. The darkest part of solitary confinement is that you start to forget about cars, and jobs, and families, and weather, and politicians, and all the things that make up a society.''   Manning again tried to kill herself, but a guard spotted her before she lost consciousness. A week later, she was returned to general population. She was beside herself with anger and fear. She was also, she told me, most likely suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder -- from Iraq, from Quantico.   It was during her second stretch in solitary that Manning experienced an episode that the Army has no record of, and that, on the heels of the suicide attempts, seems to be indicative of severe mental anguish. In a legal brief, Manning details a vivid kind of fever dream that she still puzzles over -- hearing ''several reports of suppressed or silenced shots from a pistol'' and listening as a group of strangers described their plans to remove her from the U.S.D.B. She refused to leave her cell, she says, and the next morning, the staff carried on as if nothing had happened.   To Manning's attorneys, it was obvious that their client was running out of time. ''Chelsea needs help, and she's not getting it,'' Strangio told me this winter. He viewed a commutation application, filed in November, as Manning's best hope. In the petition, Manning's lawyers appended a letter from Manning. ''I am not Bradley Manning,'' she wrote. ''I really never was. I am Chelsea Manning, a proud woman who is transgender and who, through this application, is respectfully requesting a first chance at life.''   On the afternoon of Jan. 17, Manning was in the prison workshop, covered head to toe in wood shavings. She remembers looking up to see a team of security personnel enter the room. ''I'm like, Oh, God, I'm in a lot of trouble,'' Manning told me. ''I don't even know what the hell I've done now.''' The prison's head of security told her to come with them.   ''Am I coming back?'' she asked. No, she was told.   She grabbed her belongings and followed the guards to the Special Housing Unit. Assuming she was going back to solitary, she started to take the shoelaces out of her boots. The lead officer shook his head: She was headed for Protective Custody. In the common area, a television was playing CNN. She saw the banner on the screen: Manning's sentence commuted, it read.   Manning told me she went numb. She never let herself think about a commutation, lest she be thrown back into a deeper darkness. ''It was so hard for me to process and deal with it,'' Manning recalled. Obama later addressed the decision with an implicit rebuke to Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. ''Let's be clear: Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence, so the notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital classified information would think that it goes unpunished, I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served,'' he said.   Four months later, on the morning of May 17, Manning was marched out the front door of the U.S.D.B. and loaded into a Ford Explorer. The driver steered the S.U.V. up a short slope and onto the curved road that winds south, past the gates of the overgrown U.S.D.B. cemetery, where 14 executed German prisoners of war were buried in 1945. A constellation of brick buildings appeared in the distance. Close to 1 a.m., the Explorer drew to a halt in a parking lot, where Strangio and Hollander were waiting. Manning was so eager to hug the two attorneys that she clocked Strangio in the face with her elbow.   The week I spent with Manning in New York felt like a moment of suspended animation: the days between all the chaos of her life before and whatever was going to come next. In her final months at the U.S.D.B., Manning put together 300 pages of memoir, and she's acquired an agent to shop the draft around. This fall, she will appear in a documentary called ''XY Chelsea,'' produced by Laura Poitras. Her attorneys, meanwhile, continue to work on her appeal. Even if she is exonerated, it is hard to know how comfortable her life will be in the years to come, given that some of the nation will never likely reconcile itself to what she did.   But she is determined not to dwell on her reputation, and for that week in Manhattan, she seemed happy being free. We trudged, unnoticed, through busy city streets, ordered chicken nuggets at McDonald's, ate in restaurants and cafes and went to a weekend screening of ''Alien: Covenant.'' On the way into the theater, the man collecting the tickets asked to check Manning's bag. I held my breath, thinking she would be recognized. But kneeling, Manning unzipped the main compartment, revealing her laptop. She was waved through: The famous whistle-blower and former military prisoner had become just another Sunday evening theatergoer.   It occurred to me that if Manning sometimes seemed to have difficulty interpreting the effect her actions had on the world, it was in part a result of the extraordinary isolation she had experienced even before her arrest, in her childhood in Crescent, when she longed for a solution for her pain. Later, in solitary in Kuwait or Quantico, or in the special housing unit at the U.S.D.B., that isolation had been made physical: The ''feedback loop'' she had spoken of to me had been torn. Now she had the ability to live publicly and openly as she always knew she was, and she was adjusting to the idea, sinking into it as if it were a cold pond. More than once, as we walked the streets of New York, I felt I was in the presence of someone coming fully alive for the very first time. Manning told me she understood that her identity and the actions that led to her arrest have long been tangled up in the public imagination, sometimes in uncomfortable ways: An appellate brief filed last year by Manning's legal team implied that the Army's inability to treat Manning's gender dysphoria was a contributing factor in the leaks. Manning didn't want to discuss ''hypotheticals,'' what would have happened if circumstances were different, but she was adamant on one thing: ''What I can tell you,'' she said, ''is that my values would have been the same. The things I care about would have been the same.''   One morning, at the end of an interview, Manning handed me a white envelope. Inside was a note from a 14-year-old trans boy. ''I just wanted to say that I'm glad you're gonna be free in a few months,'' the boy had scrawled in pen, ''and that I'm proud of you (is that weird thing to say?). You're an inspiration.'' Manning placed the note back in the envelope. If she was being honest, she said, she never particularly wanted to be a role model. I asked if Manning's life would have been different if she'd had such a person. She stared down at her hands. ''I don't know how,'' she said finally, ''but it would have been better.''   A couple of days later, we spent an hour sitting on a park bench. The skies were bruised, but the air was warm and fragrant. A flock of pigeons nearby. Manning cooed at them. She told me that at Leavenworth, not long before she learned of her commutation, a robin had alighted at her window, a small messenger from the world outside. Hadn't it been a sign? She had taken it as one.   Additional credits: Hair color: André Viveiros. Hair: Christiaan. Makeup: Fulvia Farolfi. Nails: Rieko Okusa. Clothes: Gabriela Hearst and Brandon Maxwell.

Daily Report: The Ugly Aftermath of a Cyberattack,"The aftermath of a cyberattack is not pretty. So writes Nicole Perlroth, a cybersecurity reporter for The New York Times, who chronicles in detail the fallout from last week's cyberattack that hit Ukraine, Europe and multinational companies.     For many of those companies, the toll has been severe and continuing. Mondelez International, a food and beverage company, saw some its factories grind to a halt after the attack stopped thousands of its servers and computers, Nicole found. At the global law firm DLA Piper, which was affected, computer systems are still coming back online. And one company, Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Lysol spray, had to lower its sales forecast because of the attack's impact on its supply chain.   At the same time, reports of other cyberattacks against companies are emerging. Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation was targeted by hackers who have been trying to penetrate companies that supervise and run nuclear power stations and other energy facilities, Nicole writes. The nature of these hacking attempts has spurred an urgent joint report from the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   One can only imagine the aftermath of an attack like that, were the hackers to get all the goods they were after.     "
"Russia Must Restore Ukraine Territory, Tillerson Says","KIEV, Ukraine -- Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson assured Ukraine's leader on Sunday that the United States would not lift economic sanctions against Russia until it ''reverses the actions'' that prompted them and restores the country's ''territorial integrity,'' appearing to set the same high bar for sanctions relief that the Obama administration did. Mr. Tillerson's strongly worded statement, issued at a news conference in Kiev alongside President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, seemed to insist that Moscow withdraw Russian troops and heavy weapons from eastern Ukraine and return Crimea, the Black Sea territory that Russia annexed in 2014 -- though Mr. Tillerson never specifically mentioned that disputed peninsula by name.     His comments came on the same day that President Trump said sanctions were not discussed at his meeting on Friday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. And Mr. Trump walked into a new controversy with his declaration on Twitter that he and Mr. Putin had agreed to create ''an impenetrable Cyber Security unit,'' suggesting for the first time that the two biggest adversaries in cyberspace would somehow police it together.   Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded.. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017   Mr. Trump's tweet came as intelligence officials appeared increasingly convinced that Russian cyberactivity continued well after the election, and that the Russian government was likely behind recent intrusions into business systems at American nuclear power plants.   Mr. Trump said Sunday he had ''strongly pressed'' Mr. Putin twice during their meeting last week on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, over interference in the election. Mr. Putin's primary diplomatic objective during their meeting was thought to be the lifting of Western sanctions. Mr. Trump had questioned the value of those sanctions during his 2016 campaign for president, and Mr. Putin may have seen his best opportunity to achieve that goal.   But in a statement posted on Twitter minutes after Mr. Tillerson finished speaking, Mr. Trump wrote that ''sanctions were not discussed in my meeting with President Putin,'' and added, ''Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved!''   Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin. Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017   Mr. Tillerson's statement Sunday in Kiev was more definitive on the issue of sanctions than his boss's tweet, perhaps a reflection of the political reality in Washington, where the Senate voted, 97 to 2, last month to toughen sanctions because of Russia's continued intervention in eastern Ukraine, Moscow's attempts to intimidate former Soviet states and the conclusion of American intelligence agencies that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election.   The administration has sought to water down the sanctions bill to give itself more leeway in dealing with Russia, an effort that was viewed by many Republicans and Democrats as a way to relax sanctions without congressional approval.   It was unclear how the Russians might react to Mr. Tillerson's comments insisting that Moscow restore Ukraine's territorial integrity. A few days ago, Mr. Tillerson announced he was appointing a new special envoy, Kurt Volker, to help settle the dispute in Ukraine in part at the request of Mr. Putin. And Russian officials believed they had made progress in Mr. Putin's meeting with Mr. Trump.   As Mr. Tillerson spoke Sunday, Mr. Volker sat in the front row, and he was to remain in Kiev after Mr. Tillerson departed to discuss how to enforce the largely ignored Minsk accord agreed in 2015 that envisioned a way out of the Ukraine impasse.   During his short news conference in Kiev with Mr. Poroshenko, who took office after one of Mr. Putin's acolytes was pushed from power, Mr. Tillerson also declined to say whether Mr. Trump, during his meeting with the Russian president, accepted Mr. Putin's denials that Russia was involved in efforts to influence the 2016 election.   Mr. Tillerson was the only other senior American official in the room during the presidents' meeting. His Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told reporters after the meeting in Hamburg that Mr. Trump had been persuaded by Mr. Putin's arguments.   When pressed on the question, Mr. Tillerson used language he had used Friday night, calling the election hacks the ''first topic for discussion.''   ''In all candidness, we did not expect an answer other than the one we received,'' he said Sunday. ''And so I think that was about the way we expected the conversation to go.''   Mr. Trump has frequently expressed doubts about Russia's involvement in hacking the servers of the Democratic National Committee and compromising the email accounts of prominent Democratic operatives, dismissing the conclusions of American intelligence agencies as politicized in the Obama era.   Mr. Tillerson suggested that the two leaders would never reach a common understanding of what happened last year. ''I don't know if we will ever come to an agreement, obviously with our Russian counterparts on that. I think the important thing is how do we assure that this doesn't happen again.''   The two sides announced a new effort last week in Hamburg, focused on avoiding interference in elections and curbing cybersabotage.   By Mr. Tillerson's telling, that effort will start modestly, with discussions about '' a framework under which we might begin to have agreement on how to deal with these very complex issues of cyberthreats, cybersecurity, cyberintrusions.''   Mr. Trump's tweet seemed to indicate the cooperation would go beyond merely discussions.   To many at the National Security Agency and United States Cybercommand, a ''Cyber Security unit'' between Russia and the United States as described by Mr. Trump would be akin to creating a joint missile-defense unit with the North Koreans. The United States is deeply inside Russian computer networks -- for surveillance, and if need be to conduct offensive action -- and the same is true about Russian penetration of American networks. It is hard to imagine intelligence services on either side giving that up.     "
Single-Minded at Homeland Security,"WASHINGTON -- When President Trump addressed employees of the Department of Homeland Security, just five days after being sworn in, he essentially had one issue on his mind: cracking down on illegal immigration. Absent from the speech was any mention of the department's other responsibilities, like protecting the nation's critical infrastructure, including computer systems, ensuring airline passenger safety or even protecting the president himself.    The address in January, critics said, reflected the president's nearly single-minded priority for the Department of Homeland Security, which employs nearly 250,000 people in seven agencies.   ''It's all immigration, it's the wall and it's enforcement,'' said Juliette Kayyem, a Homeland Security official in the Obama administration. ''Nothing about FEMA or cyber or counterintelligence,'' she added, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''Just immigration all the time.''    Homeland Security officials reject the idea that the agency is too focused on immigration. Officials noted that Mr. Trump signed an executive order on cybersecurity and has proposed adding money and staff to the agency's cybersecurity efforts.   The officials add that the president appointed Brock Long, an experienced emergency management official, to head FEMA. Mr. Long was confirmed, 95 to 4, by the Senate.   They also point out that John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary, has taken a number of steps to protect air travel, including a temporary ban on portable electronics from some countries and implementing new screening measures to thwart attacks.   ''No one is going to tell you that immigration and border security aren't priorities; they are the priorities that the president ran on,'' said Jonathan Hoffman, assistant secretary for public affairs at the department. ''But the focus on these issues isn't so much that we have neglected any part of the Department of Homeland Security.''   But so far the Trump administration has focused on illegal immigration: building a wall along the border with Mexico, hiring thousands of new Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and deporting tens of thousands of people in the country illegally.   Illegal immigration was the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, drawing large crowds as he promised to build a border wall and deport millions in the country illegally. But security experts said the country faces a number of continuing threats ranging from domestic terrorists to attacks from political extremists and cyberattacks against the nation's election systems that demand the full attention of the Department of Homeland Security.   ''John Kelly and his staff have a wide portfolio,'' said Tom Ridge, who served as the first Homeland Security secretary, under President George W. Bush. ''I hope the White House realizes that they have an enormous job in protecting the border and the nation's infrastructure from cyberattacks. They can't be used just to keep campaign promises.''   The budget proposal Mr. Trump submitted to Congress prioritizes agencies and programs that target illegal immigration.   Under the plan, funding would increase just over 21 percent for Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol. Much of the increase would be used to build a border wall. But the agency would also be charged with hiring 5,000 new Border Patrol agents, even as the number of people crossing the border illegally has declined. Last month, 21,659 border crossers were caught, compared with 45,722 in June 2016, a 53 percent decrease.   Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's budget would increase even more, nearly 30 percent. The new funding would pay for more deportation officers, detention centers and money to fly or bus unauthorized immigrants back to their home countries.   But other services and programs within Homeland Security would have their funding cut. The proposed budget includes cuts to the Coast Guard, elimination of the Transportation Security Administration's teams of uniformed armed officers that sweep public facilities and shutdowns of several of the department's national labs, including one in New York City that helps detect nuclear radiation. Several grant programs that pay for local police officers in airports or those that fight extremism would be cut or reprogrammed.   For example, Life After Hate, a group that works to deradicalize neo-Nazis and members of white supremacist groups, was slated to get $400,000 in the final days of the Obama administration. But Homeland Security canceled funding to the group in favor of groups and law enforcement agencies that target Muslim extremists.   Cutting grant programs that combat domestic extremism is a mistake when attacks by white supremacist and other hate groups are on the rise, said Erroll Southers, a former F.B.I. agent who is the director of a program at the University of Southern California that studies homegrown extremism.   ''You can't just focus on threats by ISIS or other groups, although it's important,'' he said, referring to the Islamic State. ''But there are real threats here at home that have to be addressed.''   Mr. Hoffman, the Homeland Security spokesman, said that the agency's critics were misguided and that their criticism did not reflect the day-to-day operation of the department.   ''We're not out there talking about cybersecurity, T.S.A., FEMA and other issues every day, but the focus is on it every day,'' he said. ''All the components and agencies are sufficiently funded to do their jobs.''   Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, a frequent critic of the department, said the White House bore a large share of the blame for what she considered the agency's overemphasis on targeting immigrants who were in the country illegally but posed little threat.   But she said Mr. Kelly should also be held accountable for the agency's immigration priorities. Ms. Harris was one of nearly a dozen Democratic senators who did not vote to confirm him.   ''During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Kelly came across as this person who would be a moderating voice in the Trump administration, someone who would speak truth to power,'' said Ms. Harris, a member of the Homeland Security Committee. ''But that's not what we're seeing from him as secretary of Homeland Security. Under him, this agency has seemed eager to carry out the destructive immigration policies of this administration.''   Leon E. Panetta, a former director of the C.I.A. and secretary of defense, said Mr. Kelly was simply following orders.   ''John Kelly is being a good Marine,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''He was loyal to me, and he's loyal to his commander in chief. I don't think some of the things the department is doing reflect the views of John Kelly.''

Russia's Fake Americans,"It is commonly believed that Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential campaign consisted mainly of the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails and unfavorable stories circulated abroad about Hillary Clinton. But as a startling investigation by Scott Shane of The New York Times, and new research by the cybersecurity firm FireEye, now reveal, the Kremlin's stealth intrusion into the election was far broader and more complex, involving a cyberarmy of bloggers posing as Americans and spreading propaganda and disinformation to an American electorate on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms. Whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians is, of course, the question at the heart of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Donald Trump Jr. told Senate investigators this week that he met with Russians claiming to have dirt on Mrs. Clinton because it could concern her ''fitness, character or qualifications.'' But Russia's guile in using hackers and counterfeit Facebook and Twitter accounts to undermine her campaign represents a new dimension in disinformation that must not go unchallenged by Mr. Trump, however much he may have benefited from it and however close his relationship to Russian President Vladimir Putin.     The attack, according to the Times report, involved hundreds or even thousands of fake accounts on Facebook and Twitter that regularly posted anti-Clinton messages.   To viewers, the messages resembled the normal partisan give-and-take one expects in a political campaign; in fact they came from foreign sources. Many of the rapid-fire salvos came from automated accounts.   In the normal bounds of American politics, such partisan messaging is required by law to account for its source -- as in ''I'm candidate McAdoo and I approve this message.'' But in the riotous world of social media, disclosure is not a high priority.   Now that the scheming is clear, Facebook and Twitter say they are reviewing the 2016 race and studying how to defend against such meddling in the future. Facebook announced Wednesday the removal of 470 fake accounts and pages ''likely'' engineered in Russia. It requires account identities and can challenge the bona fides of fakers. Twitter does not, nor does it prohibit automated accounts, which can create fake ''trends'' to attract readers. Between them, the sites have more than two billion accounts.   Russia has not exactly hidden its intentions. In February of last year, a top cyberintelligence adviser to Mr. Putin, Andrey Krutskikh, hinted at a Moscow conference of a possible attack. ''I'm warning you: We are on the verge of having something in the information arena which will allow us to talk to the Americans as equals,'' he said. Mr. Putin has insisted there is ''no proof'' Russia is directing the work of ''free spirited'' hackers -- despite decisive American intelligence to the contrary.   Facing the Russian challenge will involve complicated issues dealing with secret foreign efforts to undermine American free speech. National security agencies in Washington have identified Russian involvement in the spread of the email leaks that bedeviled Mrs. Clinton, and the Russian military intelligence agency's use of hackers to penetrate state voting systems.   But it is unclear whether any federal agency is focused specifically on the problems Mr. Shane and FireEye have illuminated -- foreign intervention through social media to feed partisan anger and suspicion in a polarized nation.   The social media scheming is further evidence of what amounted to unprecedented foreign invasion of American democracy. If President Trump and Congress are not outraged by this, American voters should ask why.

Safeguarding elections in the digital age,"Technology threatens to fundamentally change the nature of elections and democratic governance. New media forms, including social media, are fueling political polarization as people communicate with general audiences and narrowly focused groups, without the deliberation typical of traditional forms of communication. Hacking, misinformation, ''fake news'' and cybersecurity threats are expanding the power of a few while undermining public confidence in the accuracy of mass media and information. Politicians are using detailed voter information to play to their bases, allowing them to ignore the rest of their constituents.    Democratization, which had advanced steadily for decades, is now threatened by the rise of authoritarian governments and the closing of the political space to civil society, journalists and others.    Advances in election technology are also bringing new opportunities and new fears -- founded and unfounded -- about the security of the election process. Technology is being introduced into electoral processes to promote efficiency, but it also moves voting and counting into the unobservable digital realm. In the Netherlands, electronic voting has been abandoned amid concerns about foreign interference in elections. During the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States, Russian hackers broke into the Democratic National Committee's email system, most likely trying to influence the election's outcome.   We must accommodate these changing times while holding true to our unchanging principles -- equality, justice and freedom for all. This means building political processes that are inclusive and transparent and that hold those in power accountable.   In the United States, our path has been nonlinear and riddled with failures, including slavery, racial and sexual discrimination, and abuse of indigenous peoples. The gap between rich and poor has grown wider in recent decades, while longstanding barriers to voter participation, equal justice and economic opportunities for all remain. Nevertheless, we persevere, striving to correct and improve our democracy.   Internationally, globalization has contributed to increasing wealth, but billions of people still struggle under crushing poverty. We now face the threat of that wealth influencing the outcome of elections and subsequent government decisions.   Our society has worked to develop global norms and an international system to protect human rights for decades, from the development of the United Nations and the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 to current worldwide efforts to secure political, economic and social rights. At the Carter Center, we helped strengthen the United Nations' system. During the course of observing more than 100 elections, we also worked to build consensus on international election standards that are rooted in human rights commitments.   Genuine elections are essential for people to express their political will, but elections cannot guarantee democratic governance. This will be even more true as digital technology advances. It's essential that we manage these changes within the broader framework of strengthening our commitment to human rights and democracy -- not to threaten self-governance, but rather to safeguard it.   This means improving systems for inclusive and effective political participation, including full and easy (or even automatic) access to voter registration processes and appropriate identification for all. This is especially critical for groups that have faced obstacles to full participation, including women, racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous people, the elderly, the disabled and those living in extreme poverty.   Transparency in elections and political processes is needed to build trust and popular confidence. Voters must be able to freely examine key information about governance and about electoral processes and results. For example, in the United States, voting technologies should include paper trails that can be audited; there should be fewer barriers to independent nonpartisan observers; and the results of audits and reviews should be readily available to the public.   Effective voter participation in governance and policy-making in the digital era will require additional protections for rights and freedoms such as freedom of expression and association and access to information -- including the internet. Citizens will need better tools to assess the quality and accuracy of information, such as fact-checking apps that crosscheck information against recognized sources and databases.   We must also develop legal frameworks and technological systems that protect privacy and the security of our personal information, with processes for independent oversight. People must be able to learn what data is being gathered about them and who has access to it.   We must understand how all of this information is being used by media, corporations, governments and others to shape political views and behavior, and develop and implement standards and codes of practice to ensure that this does not undermine our common principles.   In these and other challenges, the enduring principles of democracy and human rights must be our guiding lights, or the digital future could be dark indeed.

"2 Executives Retire Immediately, Company Announces","Equifax, the credit reporting agency, said Friday that its chief information officer and chief security officer were retiring, one week after the company revealed that a cyberattack potentially compromised confidential information of 143 million Americans. The retirements would be ''effective immediately,'' the company said.  Since it disclosed the breach, Equifax has come under intense scrutiny for how it has handled data as well as its response to the intrusion. The company is facing inquiries from the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as several state attorneys general. The company's chief executive, Richard Smith, is scheduled to testify before Congress next month.    The company on Friday also provided further details about when it detected the breach and which part of its website hackers targeted. Hackers infiltrated an application on its site where consumers could dispute the accuracy of credit information, the company said. It noticed suspicious traffic to the application on July 29 and took it offline the next day. Equifax then patched the vulnerability in the application and put the application back online.   The company said it had immediately worked to stop the intrusion, and the following week engaged Mandiant, an independent cybersecurity firm, to oversee an investigation into the scope and causes of the breach. Its internal investigation is still ongoing, Equifax said.     "
From Russia With Poison,"There is an abiding dream in the tech world that when all the planet's people and data are connected it will be a better place. That may prove true. But getting there is turning into a nightmare -- a world where billions of people are connected but without sufficient legal structures, security protections or moral muscles among companies and users to handle all these connections without abuse. Lately, it feels as if we're all connected but no one's in charge.    Equifax, the credit reporting bureau, became brilliant at vacuuming up all your personal credit data -- without your permission -- and selling it to companies that wanted to lend you money. But it was so lax in securing that data that it failed to install simple software security fixes, leaving a hole for hackers to get the Social Security numbers and other personal information of some 146 million Americans, or nearly half the country.    But don't worry, Equifax ousted its C.E.O., Richard Smith, with ''a payday worth as much as $90 million -- or roughly 63 cents for every customer whose data was potentially exposed in its recent security breach,'' Fortune  reported. That will teach him!   Smith and his board should be in jail. I'm with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who told CNBC, ''So long as there is no personal responsibility when these big companies breach consumers' trust, let their data get stolen, cheat their consumers ... then nothing is going to change.''   Facebook, Google and Twitter are different animals in my mind. Twitter has enabled more people than ever to participate in the global conversation; Facebook has enabled more people than ever to connect and build communities; Google has enabled everyone to find things like never before.   Those are all good things. But the three companies are also businesses, and the last election suggests they've all connected more people than they can manage and they've been naïve about how many bad guys were abusing their platforms.   As Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, put it to me, ''Up to now these companies have not taken the threat that Russia and other foreign agents pose to our system seriously enough or invested enough or to really reveal what happened in 2016 -- or what is still happening now.''   Last November, Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg dismissed as ''a pretty crazy idea'' evidence that people were using Facebook to generate fake news to tip the U.S. election. Last week, after disclosing hundreds of Russia-linked accounts -- where fictional people posing as U.S. activists spread inflammatory messages about immigration and guns and trashed Hillary Clinton and boosted Donald Trump -- Zuckerberg admitted, ''Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it.''   One reason Facebook was slow to respond is that its business model was to absorb all of the readers of the mainstream media newspapers and magazines and to absorb all their advertisers -- but as few of their editors as possible. An editor is a human being you have to pay to bring editorial judgment to content on your website, to make sure things are accurate and to correct them if they're not. Social networks preferred to use algorithms instead, but these are easily gamed.   On Sept. 28, Twitter executives sat for a briefing for the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. Afterward, The Times reported, ''Twitter said that it had found about 200 accounts that appeared to be linked to the Russian campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election -- a small fraction of the number found by outside researchers.''   Twitter's presentation, said Senator Warner, ''showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions.'' It was ''frankly inadequate on every level.''   And on Monday The Times reported that Google had found evidence that Russian agents spent tens of thousands of dollars buying ads on ''its wide-ranging networks in an effort to interfere with the 2016 presidential campaign.''   Every week we are coming to realize that we do not know the depth of this Russian hacking -- and that the people who did it were incredibly sophisticated, not only about the technology platforms but also about which districts and demographics to target with just the right inflammatory messages.   America's democracy is built on two principles: truth and trust. We trust that our elections are fair and that enables our peaceful rotations of power. And we trust that the news we get from our mainstream outlets is true and that it is corrected if it is not. And we expect our president to defend both. But today many people are getting news from platforms that are easily polluted by Russian or other hackers with fake news. And our president is a liar who refuses to hold Russia to account for anything. It's a terrible combination.   We can't fix Trump right now. But have Equifax and these big social networks become so much part of the wiring of our lives -- and the impacts of their failures so consequential -- that they should be regulated in new ways? I don't know, but I know it's time for this discussion. It's already started.   Said Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, ''We must update our laws to ensure that when political ads are sold online Americans know who paid for them.''   These companies make billions selling our data, but they're ambivalent about taking responsibility ''for the uses, and abuses, of their platforms,'' argued the Harvard political philosopher Michael Sandel. ''They can't have it both ways. If they claim they are neutral pipes and wires, like the phone company or the electric company, they should be regulated as public utilities. But if, on the other hand, they want to claim the freedoms associated with news media, they can't deny responsibility for promulgating fake news.''   In the early 20th century, added Sandel, ''the rise of monopolies and concentrated economic power brought forth an era of progressive reform that regulated railroads, banks and utilities in the public interest. Today, we need a similar spirit of reform. These platforms are so dominant that, like electric wires or telephone lines, we can scarcely avoid using them. But when they allow our personal data -- or elections -- to be hacked, there's not much we can do about it.''   ''A century ago, we found ways to rein in the unaccountable power associated with the Industrial Revolution,'' concluded Sandel. ''Today, we need to figure out how to rein in the unaccountable power associated with the digital revolution.''

"Fearing Hackers, States Upgrade Voting Systems","WASHINGTON -- State election officials, worried about the integrity of their voting systems, are pressing to make them more secure ahead of next year's midterm elections. Reacting in large part to Russian efforts to hack the presidential election last year, a growing number of states are upgrading electoral databases and voting machines, and even adding cybersecurity experts to their election teams. The efforts -- from both Democrats and Republicans -- amount to the largest overhaul of the nation's voting infrastructure since the contested presidential election in 2000 spelled an end to punch-card ballots and voting machines with mechanical levers.    One aim is to prepare for the 2018 and 2020 elections by upgrading and securing electoral databases and voting machines that were cutting-edge before Facebook and Twitter even existed. Another is to spot and defuse attempts to depress turnout and sway election results by targeting voters with false news reports and social media posts.   West Virginia's elections team has added a cybersecurity expert from the state National Guard with a top-secret federal security clearance. Colorado and Rhode Island will now verify election results via an advanced statistical procedure called a risk-limiting audit.    Delaware is moving its voter-registration list off the state's aging mainframe computer and preparing to replace a 21-year-old electronic voting system that does not leave a paper record of votes to be audited.   Last month, a panel of state, federal and private election experts completed a sweeping revision of guidelines for manufacturers of new voting equipment, the first major overhaul in a dozen years. While the guidelines are voluntary, they are endorsed by all but three states, so manufacturers effectively must meet the new standards to sell their equipment in most of the nation.   Of course, threats to democracy and fair voting -- such as gerrymandered election districts and disinformation campaigns on Facebook and other social media platforms -- go well beyond election technology. And so far state and federal funds have often failed to match the scale and urgency of the problem. But in a time of widespread skepticism about the security of American elections, ensuring people that their votes have been counted accurately has become a pressing demand.   ''What's happening is a psy-ops operation,'' said Mac Warner, the West Virginia secretary of state. ''That's what the Russians are running against us now, trying to erode confidence in our democratic process. We need to assure our citizens that we're aware of these attacks, that we have assistance to counter them, and that when they do occur, don't panic -- there are resources to turn to.''   In an era of bitter political divisions and elections-rules disputes, the effort to make the vote more secure is notably bipartisan and relatively rancor-free. Republicans like Mr. Warner are largely aligned with Democrats on the need to act before the next presidential election in 2020, and there is some support in both parties in Congress for helping to finance changes.   Experts have warned for years that state and local election equipment and security practices were dangerously out of date, but state and local election agencies short of cash have often lagged in updating their systems. The 2016 election, however, laid bare the seriousness of the threat.   Federal officials have said they are confident that November's election results were not tampered with. But federal intelligence and security officials were so shaken by Russian attempts to compromise the vote that the Department of Homeland Security designated election systems a critical national infrastructure, like banking and the electrical grid, that merit special protection.   The scope of the threat was underscored on Tuesday when a new report concluded not only that widely used voting systems can be breached by hackers -- sometimes with almost trivial ease -- but that they contain components manufactured in nations like China with a clear interest in undermining American democracy.   ''It's really important not to overstate the risk. There are lots of things that can be done to make sure machines are as secure as possible,'' Lawrence Norden, the deputy director of the Democracy Project at the Brennan Center for Justice of the New York University School of Law. ''But when you're dealing with a nation-state, you have to assume that at some point they're going to be successful in their efforts to breach things. The question then becomes resiliency and the ability to show people that you can fix things even if there is a breach.''   State officials, who zealously guard their control of elections, have greeted federal efforts to address voting security with wariness. But that, too, has changed. State election directors who were blindsided and angered by the Homeland Security department's critical infrastructure designation will meet with department officials in Atlanta this month to discuss how they can share information about threats. The department also is working to give state election officials security clearances so they can view classified assessments of dangers to the election system.   The new guidelines for manufacturers of voting equipment -- reduced to five pages from more than 200 -- include for the first time principles as basic as a requirement that voting devices produce written records that can be verified, and that software or hardware errors cannot lead to undetectable changes in tallies. They are expected to spur the development of a new generation of cheaper and more secure equipment, said Matthew Masterson, the chairman of the federal Election Assistance Commission.   He said the shared guidelines would allow for the deployment of election software on products like tablets and iPads, which could be ready as soon as the 2020 election, rather than force 50 states to put together their own systems. ''It's going to drive innovation, hopefully save money for election officials, and allow us to test and certify equipment more efficiently,'' Mr. Masterson said.   Foreign governments that regularly crack the computers of military contractors and federal agencies will not be daunted by the cyberdefenses of voter databases and electronic pollbooks. A determined adversary could compromise voting equipment at many points along the supply chain, from the factory assembler to the election software programmer to the technician who makes a repair or installs a software upgrade. And in an industry dominated by a handful of companies, malicious tinkering could have a broad impact.   ''In computer security, you're talking much more about the capabilities of local jurisdictions,'' said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technology officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. ''And they vary dramatically, from L.A., which has a small army of folks, to many jurisdictions that don't even have a full-time person for their election work. To the extent they have an ability to defend against these attacks, it's quite limited.''   Mr. Hall said election officials need to be even more vigilant, and impose a ''zero-trust networking'' policy on their agencies. ''Don't assume that because something is locked in a case that it's safe,'' he said. ''Assume they're already in your system, and set up things that will catch them -- honey pots, fake data stores. If anyone hits them, then you know someone's poking around.''   For all the expressions of resolve, money remains the biggest obstacle to a complete overhaul of the system. Many jurisdictions rely on equipment bought after the 2002 Help America Vote Act, Congress's response to the problems exposed by the 2000 presidential election, allotted nearly $4 billion for new machines and other reforms. Many of those machines are at or past the end of their service lives; Georgia conducted November's elections on voting machines running Windows 2000, and parts of Pennsylvania relied on Windows XP.   Most states still use paper ballots that are counted by hand or by machines. But four other states besides Delaware -- Louisiana, Georgia, New Jersey and South Carolina -- use paperless systems that leave no audit trail, as do large swaths of Pennsylvania and some other states. Virginia scrapped thousands of paperless voting machines in 2015 after discovering that even an amateur hacker could easily and secretly change vote tallies.   A number of states and jurisdictions are replacing old equipment, and Los Angeles County -- with 5.3 million registered voters, the nation's largest election district -- has designed an election system from scratch, and is asking manufacturers to bid on supplying it.   Bipartisan legislation in both the House and Senate would provide a modest amount of federal money for new machines. But prospects for passage are uncertain, and many states are unable or unwilling to fill the breach.   The South Carolina Election Commission estimates that it could cost $40 million to replace the state's antiquated voting equipment with machines that used auditable paper ballots. So far the State Legislature has come up with $1 million, said Chris Whitmire, a spokesman for the commission.   ''We're using the same equipment we've used since 2004,'' he said. ''If $40 million dropped into our hands today, we'd have a paper ballot trail, too.''   But even states that cannot afford more secure machines are taking steps to harden their election systems and bolster public confidence in the vote. South Carolina has accepted an offer of free ''cyberhygiene'' scans of its system by Homeland Security experts. Colorado is upgrading its voting equipment, but it has also begun to receive Homeland Security screenings, added national guard security experts to its election team and tacked a basic security measure onto its voter-registration database: two-step authentication for anyone seeking to log into the system.   State election officials are now in regular contact with federal security and intelligence agencies about threats to the vote, said Trevor Timmons, the chief information officer for Wayne W. Williams, the Colorado secretary of state.   ''I've spent more time talking to three-letter agencies in the last year than I have in my entire career,'' he said.     "
Cyberattack Casts a Long Shadow on Equifax's Earnings,"Equifax has suffered a new intrusion -- into its profitability. Costs relating to the consumer credit reporting agency's major cyberattack helped knock earnings down 27 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. Revenue also took a big hit. And the likely biggest expenses -- including a long list of unquantified legal exposures -- are yet to rain down.  The Atlanta-based company, led by an interim chief executive, Paulino Barros, reported $87.5 million of pretax expenses in the period related to the hack, which allowed attackers to extract information on as many as 145.5 million consumers. Some of the expenses are one-offs, and others won't be. The company expects up to $75 million in additional expenses this quarter.    That may be only the tip of the iceberg. Equifax is one of a handful of credit-scoring companies that collect people's data on a huge scale and sell it to lenders, making it almost systemically important. That arguably means the bar for protecting its data is higher than for other corporations. It now faces 240 class-action lawsuits in North America, and investigations by a who's who of watchdogs, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority and the attorneys general of all 50 states. Equifax says it cannot yet estimate damages and fines, but there are likely to be some of both.   Although overall revenue was up in the third quarter, sales in its biggest division, which handles American consumer credit reports, fell 3 percent. That was a sharp turnaround from 7 percent growth in the first half, considering that the breach was made public only on Sept. 7. To give that result, the unit's revenue in the last three weeks of the quarter would have had to slump by about a third from what was expected, according to Breakingviews calculations. Executives expect overall revenue to decline by 3 to 4 percent in the fourth quarter as customers defer more orders.   Investors have lopped off about a quarter of Equifax's market capitalization since the breach. That's consistent with a sustained drop in profit on the scale of the third quarter, but it doesn't allow for an extended slide in revenue or big legal outlays. The investors may be too sanguine.     "
Signs That Russia Used Social Media to Sway Brexit Vote,"LONDON -- More than 150,000 Russian-language Twitter accounts posted tens of thousands of messages in English urging Britain to leave the European Union in the days before last year's referendum on the issue, a team of researchers disclosed on Wednesday. More than 400 of the accounts that Twitter has already identified to congressional investigators as tools of the Kremlin, other researchers said, also posted divisive messages about Britain's decision on withdrawing from the bloc, or Brexit, both before and after the vote.     Most of the messages sought to inflame fears about Muslims and immigrants to help drive the vote, suggesting parallels to the strategy that Russian propagandists employed in the United States in the 2016 election to try to intensify the polarization of the electorate.   The separate findings amount to the strongest evidence yet of a Russian attempt to use social media to manipulate British politics in the same way the Kremlin has done in the United States, France and elsewhere.   The disclosures came just two days after Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain delivered a speech accusing Russia of using cyberattacks and online propaganda to ''undermine free societies'' and ''sow discord in the West.''   On Tuesday, the chief of the National Cyber Security Center released a summary of a prepared speech asserting that in the past 12 months, Russian hackers had unleashed cyberattacks on the British energy grid and the telecommunications and media industries.   Taken together, the flurry of reports and accusations adds to growing pressure on Twitter, Facebook and other social media companies to disclose more of their internal records about advertising payments and account registrations, information essential to illuminating the extent of Russian meddling in the referendum on Brexit.   Any evidence that Moscow did, however, may also complicate the already vexed politics surrounding the issue.   Social media companies disclosed Russia's role in the American election only after prodding by Congress. Facebook, for example, disclosed this year that, over 32 months, the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency had paid more than $100,000 for online advertising, posted 80,000 pieces of divisive content and reached more than 126 million Americans.   The Kremlin has long sought to weaken or divide the European Union, perceiving it as a rival for influence in countries from the former Soviet bloc. And Russia's main propaganda outlets like Sputnik and Russia Today pushed hard for Brexit.   But the British government, consumed by the negotiations for an exit from the European Union, has not yet obtained similar disclosures. Although a parliamentary committee recently asked the social media companies for information, many critics have argued that the government has little appetite for an inquiry that could muddy its mandate.   The social media companies, including Facebook, Twitter and Google, have had little incentive to volunteer information about the exploitation of their own platforms. And the predominantly right-wing, pro-Brexit British press, particularly the powerful tabloids, have little enthusiasm for undermining the validity of the referendum.   That dynamic may now be changing. The Times of London  reported on Wednesday that a team of researchers working on an unrelated and still-unpublished study had identified 156,252 Twitter accounts that listed Russian as their language but posted messages in English to argue against the European Union.   The researchers, Oleksandr Talavera and Tho Pham, of Swansea University in Wales, said in interviews on Wednesday that the Russian accounts, which had posted very little about Brexit in the month before the referendum, became quite active at the last minute: from about 1,000 a day two weeks before the vote to 45,000 in the last 48 hours and 39,000 on the day the results were announced, June 24, 2016.   ''It is very strange that someone whose language is Russian tweets in English,'' Ms. Pham said -- describing it as an anomaly that had prompted the researchers to look more closely at 10 of the most active accounts under suspicion.   Nine had been deleted, and the last, Sveta1972, appeared to emanate from a Russian resort town. On the eve of the referendum, Sveta1972 urged Britain to ''make June the 23rd our Independence Day.''   Related findings by a separate team of researchers were reported this week by The Guardian, a strong opponent of Brexit. Those researchers had collected a sample of more than 60 million Twitter posts using hashtags related to Brexit.   They found that 419 of the 2,752 accounts already identified by Twitter to congressional committees as being linked to the Kremlin had posted 3,500 times using Brexit hashtags.   More than 70 percent of those posts were after the vote, but 38 of the accounts tweeted a total of 400 times on the day of the vote, said Laura Cram, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, who conducted the study with her colleague, Clare Llewellyn.   Researchers study Twitter for indications of broader patterns in social media, because information about its users and contents is more accessible than in the larger but less-open platforms like Facebook. But without the disclosure of more information from the companies, social scientists said, neither of the findings disclosed this week will provide conclusive evidence of a deliberate Kremlin campaign to influence the Brexit vote or other British elections.   Ms. Cram, for example, noted that Russian propagandists might have used hashtags related to Brexit only because they fit with protectionist, nativist or anti-Muslim themes that resonated in the context of the American election, as well.   ''These accounts were definitely using Brexit hashtags,'' she said, ''but we cannot say whether they were primarily trying to influence Brexit or whether it was a side effect of them trying to wreak discord generally.''   President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has denied trying to influence the Brexit vote. But concerns about Russia's use of social media to meddle in elections have become so commonplace that the Spanish government recently accused Russians of playing a significant role in the push for Catalan independence.   A third, smaller survey, reported last week by Wired magazine, found that 29 of the Russian-linked Twitter accounts identified to Congress had also tweeted 139 times about Britain or Europe. Blaming terrorist attacks on Islam or railing against immigrants were favorite themes, said Jonathon Morgan, chief executive of New Knowledge, a digital security firm based in Austin, Tex., that conducted the survey.   ''Many of these accounts strongly pushed the narrative that all Muslims should be equated with terrorists and made the case that Muslims should be banned from Europe,'' he said. ''That is very consistent with the Russian strategy on U.S. issues, and the fact that they were using the same tactics to target Europeans is extremely telling.''     "
"Experiencing Injustice, and Now Prosecuting It, as Attorney General","PARAMUS, N.J. -- On a back wall in Gurbir Grewal's office, three portraits of Japanese-Americans detained at the Manzanar internment camp in California hang above his desk, a reminder for Mr. Grewal of when the power of domestic law went horribly awry. Though the portraits are from decades ago, Mr. Grewal sees alarming parallels to the current political environment, where patriotism is sometimes measured by race, faith or political affiliation. The notion to combat this type of injustice has helped inspire Mr. Grewal, a Sikh, throughout his career, an arc that has seen him rise through the ranks of the federal justice system and now has him poised to become New Jersey's top law enforcement official.    If, as expected, the Democratic-controlled State Legislature approves his appointment by the governor-elect, Philip D. Murphy, Mr. Grewal, 44, would become the first Sikh in the United States to hold the position of statewide attorney general.   ''It's important for someone like me to do this job that's front-line law enforcement, to show people that you don't have to look a particular way to love this country,'' he said in an interview.    Mr. Grewal made his mark in criminal justice with significant federal convictions in financial and cybersecurity crimes, including a case involving two Russian hackers named Drinkman and Smilianets, who oversaw a network that stole more than 160 million credit card numbers.   But in today's political climate, attorneys general in Democratic states are increasingly being viewed as checks on Trump administration policies.   Just across the Hudson River, Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, has been an aggressive challenger to many of the policies coming out of Washington. Mr. Grewal said that he received a congratulatory call from Mr. Schneiderman this month, and that he looked forward to a ''collaborative relationship,'' though he refrained from saying whether he would join in any pending cases, only allowing that he would make such decisions when he takes office.   While Mr. Murphy promised to not pressure or interfere with Mr. Grewal, partisan entrenchments have largely transformed the position of statewide attorney general, ostensibly an apolitical position, into an inherently political one.   Mr. Grewal, the current Bergen County prosecutor, said he wasn't concerned about politics.   ''Yeah, I mean, but so what?'' Mr. Grewal said when asked about whether taking action contrary to Washington could be construed as political. ''Because you're seeing people today, it's just unconscionable, that their loyalty and their patriotism is being questioned because of what they look like, where they come from, what they believe. And, you know, that's the same thing we did in 1942. That's why I have those pictures on the wall.''   For Mr. Grewal, the appointment, which would place him in charge of the state police force and the state's prosecutors, also fulfills a local-boy-makes-good tale: He is a New Jersey native, born and raised in Essex County.   He understands the state's problems, aside from the policies coming out of Washington; Mr. Grewal has laid out key areas that he wants to focus the might of New Jersey's authority on: addiction, violent crime, police-community relations and social justice issues.   He plans to put in place methods he honed in Bergen County, such as partnering with high schools to address hate crimes and addiction. Concerned about a surge in bias and hate crimes among teenagers, especially racist bullying on social media apps like Snapchat, his office has tried to work with children and teenagers.   He noted that the training and partnering with schools and programs for youth was a bit unconventional for a prosecutor's office, but he pointed to its preventive intention.   ''We've gone outside of our lane as a law enforcement agency to address that because we know where that leads,'' he said of hate and bias. ''We don't want that to lead to some sort of criminal conduct, as we've seen that in this county -- we've seen attacks on synagogues, arsons and things of that nature and so we're trying to get in there early.''   Mr. Grewal was hired by Paul J. Fishman, then the United States attorney in New Jersey, as an assistant United States attorney in 2010. He had previously spent about four years in a similar position in Brooklyn. While he began in New Jersey in the smaller general crimes unit, he quickly progressed to take on some high-profile cases.   He prosecuted a first-of-its-kind case against Aleksandr Milrud, who was accused of manipulating stocks through high-speed trading, and he helped secure the conviction of Eliyahu Weinstein, who led a $200 million real estate fraud.   In 2016, Mr. Grewal, a Democrat, was appointed by Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, to officially take over the prosecutor's office in Bergen County, the most populous in New Jersey.   His rise to the state attorney general's office also reflects the growing Asian Indian population in New Jersey. The state has the highest percentage of people with Asian Indian backgrounds in the country, according to the Census Bureau's 2015 American Community Survey.   In 2017, Hoboken elected Ravi Bhalla as the first Sikh mayor of a major city in New Jersey, and Vin Gopal became the first Indian-American to be elected to the State Senate.   Nonetheless, despite the expanding population, national Sikh groups were surprised by the sudden representation in public offices in New Jersey.   ''There hasn't been that many Sikhs in politics, particularly ones with turbans and beard,'' said Gurwin Singh Ahuja, executive director of the National Sikh Campaign, but he added that this was beginning to change. ''New Jersey is certainly leading the pack, but there have been Sikhs being elected across the country,'' such as a city councilwoman in Kent, Wash., where in March a turbaned Sikh man was wounded by a masked gunman.   Mr. Grewal said he had also been on the receiving end of prejudice and injustice. ''Growing up, I was called so many variations of the N-word that it just confused me,'' he said.   His ethnicity does not define him, he said, but he is acutely aware that his presence in the courtroom -- suit and tie, turban and beard -- is freighted with meaning in a world where emerging acceptance still vies with underlying racism.   It was just after the Sept. 11 attacks when Mr. Grewal, then a lawyer in private practice, was constantly harassed by a man who would wait outside the office to shout, ''I've found him, I've found bin Laden!''   Enraged but also embarrassed, he said he began to develop creative ways to leave the office, slinking out back doors and leaving at odd hours. But this eventually grew both tiresome and unacceptable. He decided it was time to do something.   ''As a lawyer, you know, the options in front of me at that point were to become a prosecutor,'' he said. ''So I made it my sort of goal to get into U.S. attorney's office just so I can get up in front of a jury looking the way I do and say, 'I represent the United States.'''     "
The Health Data Conundrum,"Kathryn Haun is a federal prosecutor who teaches a course on cybercrime at Stanford Law School. Her views are her own. Eric J. Topol, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute, is the author of ''The Patient Will See You Now.'' THERE'S quite a paradox when it comes to our health data. Most of us still cannot readily look at it, but there's been an epidemic of cybercriminals and thieves hacking and stealing this most personal information. Last year hundreds of breaches involving millions of health records were reported to the Department of Health and Human Services -- with the hackings  of the health insurers Anthem and Premera Blue Cross alone affecting some 90 million Americans. At least 10 hospitals and health care systems have had their patient data and information systems literally held  for ransom. This month, the national medical lab Quest Diagnostics reported that information on 34,000 patients had been stolen. And these breaches are just the ones that have been disclosed.     Why is our private health information being stolen and trafficked by cybercriminals? For one, these records include information that makes them more valuable to hackers than almost any other type of data. Thieves can use this information to order medical equipment and drugs to resell and to fraudulently bill insurance companies, the costs of which are passed along to consumers.   Second, while our personal medical data is so precious and valuable to us, it's an exceptionally easy target for criminals. The health care industry's focus has been on patient care rather than cybersecurity, and federal regulations intended to protect financial data do not apply to health care records. It is common for millions of patients' health records to be stored together in huge central databases that, once breached, yield a trove of information.   It has become increasingly difficult to combat this problem using traditional methods of enforcement and deterrence. Even assuming the wrongdoers are identified, there are often jurisdictional hurdles because the thieves aren't in the United States or in countries that will easily extradite them. Moreover, companies that are hacked are restrained in their desire for the criminals to be prosecuted because that means their own embarrassing breach will be in the news that much longer. In April 2014, the F.B.I. issued an alert that these sorts of attacks would only increase as providers moved from paper to electronic records.   A recent theft involving Anthem is a perfect illustration. Tens of millions of patient records were compromised, all were stored in a centralized database, none were encrypted, and no one has been caught. Anthem's response was to send out letters to victims offering free credit monitoring. But credit monitoring isn't an antidote for a breach of medical records. What good does a form letter do for someone whose most private data has just been stolen?   What's the solution? For starters, disaggregation, meaning that medical data should be stored in individual or family units rather than in centralized databases. Such a regime would return the data to the person who should own it in the first place: the patient. Each individual or family would have medical data in a personal cloud or a digital wallet. Patients could then share their data how they choose: with family members, with researchers, with other doctors for a second opinion.   We cannot leave it to the health record software companies -- the Cerners, Epics and Allscripts of the world -- to bring about the needed changes. Their business is to sell proprietary information software to health systems to create large centralized databases for such things as insurance reimbursements and patient care. Their success has relied on an old, paternalistic model in medicine in which the data is generated and owned by doctors and hospitals.   Yes, giving consumers control of their own medical data would revolutionize who owns medical data and how it is used. Concerns about researchers losing access to this amassed data are overstated. Patients have shown an overwhelming willingness to share their information for altruistic reasons (which far exceeds the track record of doctors and health systems when it comes to sharing data).   The private and academic sectors are hard at work on a technology solution: one that is tamper-proof, ensures confidentiality and makes sharing medical data easy. One approach, known as a blockchain, is an encrypted data platform that would give patients digital wallets containing all their medical data, continually updated, that they can share at will.   We need to move on from the days of health systems storing and owning all our health data. Patients should be the owners of their own medical data. It's an entitlement and civil right that should be recognized.     "
Comey Says Republican Committee Was Hacked,"WASHINGTON -- The director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, told lawmakers at a Senate hearing on Tuesday that Russian hackers had penetrated the Republican National Committee's computer records, but he called it a ''limited penetration of old R.N.C.'' computer systems that were ''no longer in use.'' Mr. Comey's statement was significant because the committee said weeks ago that it did not lose data to the Russians because of its strong cybersecurity. President-elect Donald J. Trump has repeated that assertion and has also said weaknesses in Democratic National Committee systems had opened the way for their systems to be hacked.     While Mr. Comey did not go into detail, he appeared to be referring to a Russian-led attack on a contractor in Tennessee, Smartech Corporation, used by the Republican committee to host some of its websites and handle some lists of donors.   Federal investigators have said that a single email server used by that contractor had been penetrated. But it was going out of service and contained outdated material that the Russians probably found to be of little value. People with direct knowledge of the server's contents said it had been used by Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain.   An aide in Mr. Graham's office said the hacking of the email server in question occurred in June. The Graham campaign was using the server to send news clips and campaign releases, the aide said.   In an unclassified report released on Friday, the intelligence community reported that the Russians had attacked ''Republican-affiliated'' organizations but that they had chosen not to make any of that data public. The report made no specific reference to the Republican National Committee.   Pressed on the issue by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Mr. Comey said on Tuesday that there was ''evidence of hacking directed at the state level'' and at the Republican committee, ''but that it was old stuff.''   He said there was no evidence ''that the current R.N.C.'' -- he appeared to be referring to servers at the committee's headquarters or contractors with current data -- had been hacked. There is no evidence that computers used by the Trump campaign or the Clinton campaign were also compromised, though the personal email account of John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, was copied and released as part of the Russian-ordered hack.   The testimony on Tuesday was the first since the release of the declassified report on Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, and it came four days after the findings were described to Mr. Trump.   The panel, convened by the Senate Intelligence Committee, included James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and of the military's Cyber Command. John O. Brennan, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Mr. Comey also testified.   Mr. Clapper largely repeated the conclusions of last week's report, including that the goal of the Russian effort was to disparage Mrs. Clinton -- whom the Russians hoped to weaken if she won -- and over time to favor Mr. Trump.   Under questioning, Mr. Clapper said he believed that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his aides had actively ordered the operation that resulted in the hacking, though he left unclear how involved they may have been in the details.   After receiving a briefing on the report on Friday, Mr. Trump acknowledged for the first time that Russia had sought to hack into the Democratic National Committee's computer systems. But he insisted that the effort had played no role in his election, and he said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin preferred him to Mrs. Clinton.   Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the committee's vice chairman, called the election hacking ''one of the most serious events of my public life.''   At times, Democrats on the committee steered the conversation toward whether intelligence officials were investigating any link between the Russians and Mr. Trump's campaign. But Mr. Comey declined to discuss it.   ''Especially in a public forum, we never confirm or deny any investigation,'' Mr. Comey said. Many Democrats still blame him for Mrs. Clinton's defeat, citing his ambiguous letter less than two weeks before the election disclosing new questions about emails on her private server.   Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, who supported Mrs. Clinton, could not resist an aside. ''The irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid,'' he said.   Mr. Comey, seeking to establish a nonpartisan air, later joked, ''I hope I've demonstrated by now I'm tone deaf when it comes to politics -- and that's the way it should be.''   Republicans, for their part, raised few doubts about the intelligence community's conclusions, but they dwelled little on the report's finding that Mr. Putin had a clear preference for Mr. Trump.   Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, suggested that Russia had achieved its broader goal of sowing ''chaos and disorder'' in the electoral system.

Intelligence Chief's Olive Branch to Trump Gets Twisted in Translation,"â-  James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, offered a public olive branch to President-elect Donald J. Trump on Wednesday night, which Mr. Trump appears to have twisted. â-  Mr. Trump appoints Rudolph W. Giuliani to head his cybersecurity review.    â-  L.L. Bean finds itself in the middle of a Trump storm.   â-  Team Trump went to war with the news media after Mr. Trump's contentious news conference.   Clapper tries to smooth the waters, but Trump's response contradicts him    In an extraordinary statement on Wednesday night, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said he had reached out to Mr. Trump, a man who compared the intelligence agencies to Nazis, to try to ease the president-elect's concerns.   Mr. Clapper said he had expressed his ''profound dismay'' at leaks that have emerged since the intelligence chiefs briefed Mr. Trump last Friday on Russia's efforts to help elect him president. And he disavowed any authorship of the dossier of unsubstantiated compromising material that Russia is reported to have on the incoming president:   ''I emphasized that this document is not a U.S. intelligence community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the I.C. The I.C. has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions. However, part of our obligation is to ensure that policy makers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.''   Mr. Trump returned the favor with his own Twitter post Thursday morning:   Someone is lying here. Mr. Clapper's statement was explicit: The intelligence community ''has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable'' -- a far cry from a ''false and fictitious'' denunciation.   Of course, Mr. Clapper will soon be heading to the exits, replaced by former Senator Dan Coats, assuming Senate confirmation. So whether peacemaking at the top will ease the ill will in the rank and file of the Trump White House and the intelligence agencies has yet to be determined.   Giuliani named to head cybersecurity review   Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and one of Mr. Trump's most stalwart loyalists, finally has a job in the administration: heading Mr. Trump's promised effort to combat cyberattacks.   ''As the use of modern communications and technology has moved forward at unparalleled speed the necessary defenses have lagged behind. The President-elect recognizes that this needs immediate attention and input from private sector leaders to help the government plan to make us more secure.   Mr. Giuliani was asked to initiate this process because of his long and very successful government career in law enforcement and his now sixteen years of work providing security solutions in the private sector.''   Mr. Giuliani, as chairman of the global cybersecurity practice at the law firm Greenberg Traurig, brings expertise, but his experience in complex communications policy is checkered. His tenure as mayor is still haunted by the decision to place an emergency command center at the World Trade Center over the opposition of the New York Police Department. The command center, of course, was destroyed by the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.    L.L. Bean finds itself in Trumpian storm   L.L. Bean, known for its preppy sportswear, rubbery boots and New England reserve, finds itself in an unexpected position: the crossfire of the Trump wars.   When it came to light that Linda Bean, the granddaughter and heir of the company founder Leon Leonwood Bean, bankrolled a pro-Trump political action committee, opponents vowed to boycott. A group called Grab Your Wallet led the charge, nevermind that Ms. Bean's real empire is in lobsters, not Bean boots.   It's all of a piece now -- especially once the president-elect inserted himself into the fray on Twitter.   The company very much does not want to be part of this fight. In a Facebook post, Shawn Gorman, L.L. Bean's executive chairman, said:   ''We are deeply troubled by the portrayal of L.L. Bean as a supporter of any political agenda.   L.L. Bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions. Simply put, we stay out of politics. To be included in this boycott campaign is simply misguided, and we respectfully request that Grab Your Wallet reverse its position.''   There is another problem with Mr. Trump's intervention. It could contravene ethics rules that prohibit government endorsements of privately made products.   Subpart G - Misuse of Position   Subpart G contains four provisions designed to ensure that employee do not misuse their official positions. These include:   A prohibition against employees using public office for their own private gain for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom they are affiliated in a non-Government capacity, or for the endorsement or any product, service, or enterprise.   Trump team in open warfare with news media   It's hard to know which of Mr. Trump's relationships is worse: with the intelligence agencies or with the news media.   After the president-elect's contentious news conference on Wednesday, his first as president-elect, indeed his first since July, Mr. Trump graciously posted on Twitter on Thursday morning:   The soon-to-be White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, seemed to revel in the cage match that is Mr. Trump's interaction with the news media.   Mr. Spicer's toughest words were aimed at CNN's Jim Acosta, who stood at the news conference to demand a question after Mr. Trump attacked his network as ''fake news.''   Of course, in the Trump era, both sides can get mileage out of the spectacle.   Schumer comes out against Sessions's confirmation   Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, plans to announce on Thursday that he will oppose a fellow senator, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, when his nomination as attorney general comes to a vote, saying he is not confident that Mr. Sessions would ''serve as an independent check on the incoming administration.''   Questioning Mr. Sessions's commitment to the nation's most vulnerable citizens, Mr. Schumer's statement reads:   ''The attorney general of the United States has a sacred obligation to enforce our laws and uphold the constitution. The law gives a voice to the voiceless, it protects the oppressed from the powerful and it defends the rights of all people, regardless of gender, sexuality or religion. The attorney general must wake up every single day ensuring the rights of all Americans: immigrants, minorities, young and old, gay and straight, disabled and not are protected. Every right -- freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the freedom to vote or any other enshrined in our Constitution or the law -- must be protected for every American.''   The decision does not leave Mr. Sessions's ultimate confirmation in doubt. No Republican has come out against him, and more conservative Democrats, such as Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, may well support him.   But it does mean that the final Sessions vote is likely to be split largely along party lines.

Tech Roundup: Amazon Error Is a Reminder That No Company Is Infallible,"For all of its famed redundancy, the internet at times can appear awfully fragile. Two weeks ago, an Amazon employee entered an incorrect set of commands on a computer, accidentally knocking out a good chunk of the servers at an Amazon data center in Virginia.     The mistake brought down a number of websites and internet services. It was a reminder that no company is infallible -- and that technology managers should think twice before becoming too dependent on one technology provider.   Amazon Web Services is the dominant supplier of cloud-computing services to other companies. But the shutdown, which lasted a few hours for some customers, may be a talking point for competitors like Google, Microsoft and IBM. A.W.S. still has enviable uptime -- better than 99 percent. But anything short of 100 percent offers an opening to competitors.   As we have seen in the last year, the internet services we take for granted are not built upon an unbreakable foundation. In October, a so-called distributed denial of service attack targeted an obscure New Hampshire company called Dyn, whose servers monitor and reroute internet traffic.   The attack, which swamped Dyn's servers with more traffic than they could handle, lasted for about a day, causing widespread disruption to websites throughout the United States.   But at least it wasn't caused by a typo.   More tech news.   Intel buys Mobileye. The $15.3 billion deal speaks volumes about Intel's determination to make sure it can provide the computing power needed for autonomous vehicles.   Waymo asks court to block Uber's self-driving car project. Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Google's parent company, sued Uber last month, accusing it of colluding with a former Google employee to steal crucial parts of Waymo's technology to accelerate its development of autonomous vehicles.   America's most wanted cybercriminal might have helped Russia spy. While Evgeniy M. Bogachev was draining bank accounts, it appears that the Russian authorities were looking over his shoulder, grafting an intelligence operation onto a far-reaching cybercriminal scheme.     "
Hackers Post Pro-Erdogan Messages in Twitter Breach,"Twitter accounts belonging to high-profile news outlets, international brands and politicians were hacked on Wednesday, briefly showing posts in support of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president who is in a bitter standoff with several European Union countries. The dispute involves several countries, including the Netherlands and Germany, where Turkish politicians wish to hold rallies and campaign for a referendum on Turkey's proposed Constitution. The Twitter breaches on Wednesday, however, came as Dutch voters were casting ballots in their general election. Separately, websites in the Netherlands that help people decide how to vote were hit by online attacks on Tuesday.     Mr. Erdogan criticized the governments of Germany and the Netherlands, accusing them of Nazi practices, after Turkish politicians were prevented from attending events in those countries. Over the weekend, the Dutch authorities stopped the Turkish foreign minister from landing in the Netherlands, where he was to attend a rally, and they ordered the Turkish minister for families to be escorted out of the country, citing risks to public order and security.   The Twitter hacking on Wednesday appeared to be related to that growing dispute. The defamatory messages, in Turkish, accused Germany and the Netherlands of having Nazi ties, and they linked to a video of a speech by Mr. Erdogan.   While the online messages were quickly removed and control of the accounts returned to their owners, many of the targeted organizations and policy makers moved to distance themselves from what had been posted.   ''We temporarily lost control of this account, but normal service has resumed,'' the British Broadcasting Corporation wrote on Twitter after one of its accounts was breached.   Hi everyone - we temporarily lost control of this account, but normal service has resumed. Thanks. -- BBC North America (@BBCNorthAmerica) March 15, 2017   It was unclear who had carried out the digital attacks.   The problem may have originated with a hack to Twitter Counter, a third-party application employed by some account holders to keep track of their online followers. The start-up, which is based in the Netherlands, said on Wednesday that it was aware of the hacking, and that it had blocked its service's ability to post from users' Twitter handles.   In response, Twitter said that it was aware that the intrusion may have resulted from a third-party app.   ''We quickly located the source,'' Twitter said in a statement. ''No additional accounts are impacted.''   On Tuesday, a separate attack affected two websites set up to help voters choose among Dutch political parties in the general election. Known as a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, which typically involves flooding computer servers with online messages until they collapse, the attack took the Kieskompas and Stemwijzer sites offline on Tuesday afternoon.   The voter-aid websites are not part of the official electoral process.   Concerned about the role hackers and so-called fake news might have played in the American presidential election, the Dutch government announced on Feb. 1 that all ballots in the general election would be counted by hand. Previously, some votes were electronic.   ''We don't know where it is coming from, but it is an organized attack coming from abroad,'' said Anita de Jong, a spokeswoman for ProDemos, an independent government-financed organization that runs Stemwijzer. She said the geographic origin of the attack was unclear.   Engineers from the National Cyber Security Center in The Hague and from Google offered to help the organizations that run the two websites. Wednesday morning, as voting was underway, the sites were still struggling to function and were not consistently available.     "
North Korea's Ambition Seen in a Bid to Breach Global Banks,"When hackers associated with North Korea tried to break into Polish banks late last year they left a trail of information about their apparent intentions to steal money from more than 100 organizations around the world, according to security researchers. A list of internet protocol addresses, which was supplied by the security researchers and analyzed by The New York Times, showed that the hacking targets included institutions like the World Bank, the European Central Bank and big American companies including Bank of America.    While some of the Polish banks took the hackers' bait, the scheme was detected fairly quickly, and there is no evidence that any money was stolen from the intended targets. Yet security researchers said the hit list, found embedded in the code of the attack on more than 20 Polish banks, underlines how sophisticated the capabilities of North Korean hackers have become. Their goals have now turned financial, along with efforts to spread propaganda and heist data and to disrupt government and news websites in countries considered enemies.   The list of targets, which has not been previously reported, is part of a growing body of evidence showing how North Korea, a country that is cut off from much of the global economy, is increasingly trying to use its cyberattack abilities to bring in cash -- and making progressively bolder attempts to do so.    North Korea's hacking network is immense, encompassing a group of 1,700 hackers aided by more than 5,000 trainers, supervisors and others in supporting roles, South Korean officials estimate. Because of the country's poor infrastructure, the hackers typically work abroad, in places like China, Southeast Asia and Europe. Like other North Koreans allowed to work abroad, the hackers are constantly monitored by minders for possible breaches in allegiance to the government.   The security firm Symantec said it believed that the hackers behind the Poland attack were also behind two other major breaches: the theft of $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh and a 2014 attack on Sony Pictures, which rocked the film industry.   ''We found multiple links, which gave us reasonable confidence that it's the same group behind Bangladesh as the Polish attacks,'' said Eric Chien, a researcher at Symantec, which studied both attacks.   The firm has not traced the attacks to a specific country's government, but American officials have blamed North Korea for the Sony attack, partly based on intelligence that came from American breaches of  North Korea's computer systems.   The list of targets uncovered in the Polish attack -- including big American financial institutions like State Street Bank and Trust and the Bank of New York Mellon -- is illuminating for its ambition, Mr. Chien added. ''It's one thing to go after Bangladesh,'' he said, ''but it's a whole other thing to take on the U.S.''   United States prosecutors are investigating North Korea's possible role in the Bangladesh heist, according to a person briefed on the inquiry, who asked to remain anonymous because the details are confidential. And on Tuesday, Richard Ledgett, a deputy director of the National Security Agency, said that research linked the  Sony Pictures attack to the Bangladesh heist. He also affirmed that he believed nation states were now robbing banks.   All of this represents a troubling new front in cyberwarfare, Mr. Ledgett said at an event sponsored by the Aspen Institute. ''That is a big deal,'' he said.   North Korea has denied involvement in the attacks on Sony and others, instead accusing South Korea of disrupting its websites. North Korea's population is cut off from the internet except for a handful of state-run sites filled with propaganda.   The Polish episode provides a case study of how North Korean cyberattack goals have escalated.   The attack began around October when the hackers planted a virus on the website of the Polish financial regulator -- then waited for banks to inadvertently download it when they visited the site.   The perpetrators used what is called a watering-hole attack -- named after the way predators ambush prey by lazing around a high-traffic spot -- to go after the banks; in this case, the ''watering hole'' was the financial regulator's website. When the visitors on the list landed on the page, they would be redirected to software that would attempt to download malware. The list of targets extended beyond Poland, investigators said, because the group intended to carry out similar attacks elsewhere.   ''This was a global list, but they hadn't gotten around to making a watering hole for all these country banks,'' Mr. Chien said, adding that the hackers appeared to have created watering-hole sites in Mexico and Uruguay, too. Symantec said it had blocked 14 attacks against computers in Mexico and 11 in Uruguay.   The fact that the hackers were able to attack a specific site showed that their capabilities had improved, Mr. Chien said. The group also used its own modifications of code and exploits more broadly shared by cybercriminals, whereas before it had mostly built its own tools -- another indication of evolution.   While Polish banks were the most numerous targets, the second-largest number was in the United States, including the American arm of Deutsche Bank. CoBank, which lends to agriculture and rural projects, was targeted, too. The central banks of Russia, Venezuela, Mexico, Chile and the Czech Republic were on the list. The only target associated with China: branches of the Bank of China in Hong Kong and America.   North Korea has been carefully cultivating its cyberattack capabilities since the early 1990s, according to South Korean officials. Generally, the country selects young computer prodigies and trains them as hackers, according to people who have attended the South Korean government's discussions of the North's hacking operations. South Korean cybersecurity officials began detecting attacks attributed to North Korean hackers around 2009.   Working overseas is a huge incentive for young hackers, since many North Koreans have little chance to leave their impoverished, isolated country. As long as the hackers meet their government-set targets, they are allowed to live abroad and often get the added perk of running illegal gambling sites online, generating profits they can share with supervisors.   While North Korea lags developed countries in hacking capabilities, it has occasionally startled observers in South Korea. In 2011, investigators found that a South Korean bank had been hit by malware when an infected computer used by a maintenance-company employee was briefly hooked into the bank's server network.   South Korean hackers who forensically analyzed the attack were impressed not so much by the malware, but by the fact that North Korean hackers had been so constantly on alert, apparently for hours or days on end, waiting for the short window during which the infected computer was connected to the bank's servers so that they could activate the virus.   While the Pentagon has recently warned that North Korea's hacking abilities could be a cost-effective way of conducting military operations, the attacks on banks shows the country's more prosaic goal of getting money.   ''In the past, North Korean hackers usually attacked government websites with the goal of destroying systems and triggering social confusion,'' said Kim Seung-joo, a professor at the Graduate School of Information Security at Korea University in Seoul, who is an adviser for the South Korean government's cybersecurity division.   ''Now they have shifted to making money, attacking banks and private companies, apparently because the North's other means of raising foreign currency are increasingly blocked under United Nations sanctions,'' Mr. Kim said.   North Korean hackers have also begun using ransomware -- viruses that encrypt all data in an infected computer or smartphone -- to make money. The hackers demand a ransom, usually in Bitcoin, in return for providing victims with a decryption code.   In July, the South Korean police said North Korea's main intelligence agency had stolen the personal data of more than 10 million customers of Interpark, an online shopping mall in South Korea. Interpark did not learn about the breach until it received an anonymous message threatening to publicize the leak of personal data unless it paid the equivalent of $2.7 million in Bitcoin.   South Korea attributed the attack to hackers belonging to North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, its main spy agency.   In the end, no Bitcoin changed hands. Instead of paying the ransom, Interpark reported the attack to the police.   Follow Paul Mozur on Twitter @paulmozur.     "
Global Federation Says Russians Hacked Medical Records of Athletes,"Track and field's global governing body -- the sports organization that has most forcefully disciplined Russia for state-sponsored doping -- said on Monday that its computer network had been compromised by the same Russian cyberespionage group that American intelligence officials have tied to a broad effort to influence the United States presidential election. The hackers were able to gain access to athletes' private medical records, the track and field body said. The International Association of Athletics Federations, the sport's ruling body, said it had discovered the attacks on Feb. 21. It attributed them to Fancy Bear, a group that stole records from global antidoping regulators last year, after the regulator recommended that Russia be barred from the 2016 Summer Olympics. Intelligence officials and forensics experts have linked Fancy Bear to Russia's military intelligence agency.     The I.A.A.F said on Monday that it had consulted with the authorities in Britain and Monaco, where the organization has its headquarters, and secured its network in recent days.   ''Our first priority is to the athletes who have provided the I.A.A.F. with information that they believed would be secure and confidential,'' Sebastian Coe, the I.A.A.F. president, said in a statement, noting that all athletes who had filed medical records since 2012 had been informed. ''They have our sincerest apologies and our total commitment to continue to do everything in our power to remedy the situation.''   Last year, Fancy Bear hacked the athlete database of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the global regulator of drugs in sports, as well as the email account of an employee of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. Both organizations had recommended that Russia be barred from the 2016 Olympics over elaborate cheating at the previous Games.   Through the end of 2016, Fancy Bear published the confidential medical information of more than 100 athletes -- predominately from Britain and the United States -- as well as the emails of antidoping officials from the United States and Canada. As of Monday afternoon, no new information had been published to the site, titled #OpOlympics.   Both the hackers and Russian sports officials have argued that the stolen records show that Western athletes have received unfair advantages through so-called therapeutic-use exemptions, or special waivers to take drugs that are typically banned.   Any athlete can apply for such a waiver, requesting permission, for example, to use an inhaler or take a medication to treat attention-deficit disorders. Global antidoping and sports officials have denounced the disclosures, emphasizing that none of the implicated athletes had done anything wrong and that all had sought proper permissions.   In January, in a declassified intelligence report focused on the United States election, American intelligence officials said that Fancy Bear's intrusions into the World Anti-Doping Agency had originated with G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence agency also involved in the theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee. The officials suggested that the Russian state had been motivated by revenge.   ''Putin publicly pointed to the Panama Papers disclosure and the Olympic doping scandal as U.S.-directed efforts to defame Russia, suggesting he sought to use disclosures to discredit the image of the United States and cast it as hypocritical,'' the report said, referring to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.   The I.A.A.F. was among the first and most forceful in disciplining Russia for systematic doping, suspending the nation in 2015 and voting last summer to bar Russia from the Rio Olympics. Only one Russian track and field athlete, who had been living and training in the United States, was permitted to compete.   Russia remains barred from global track and field competitions and appears set to miss this summer's world championships in London. Sports officials have suggested that November may be the soonest the nation is restored to good standing.   As Russian officials have broadly apologized for doping problems, they have also regularly referred to Fancy Bear's stolen information.   ''Russia never had the opportunities that were given to other countries,'' Vitaly Smirnov, a former top Russian sports official appointed by Mr. Putin to reform the nation's antidoping system, told The New York Times in Moscow in December, referring to the World Anti-Doping Agency's hacked records as evidence. ''The general feeling in Russia is that we didn't have a chance.''     "
"Hacking Attack Woke Up Dallas With Emergency Sirens, Officials Say","Officials in Dallas said the city's warning system was hacked late on Friday night, disrupting the city when all 156 of its emergency sirens sounded into the early hours of Saturday morning. The alarms, which started going off around 11:40 p.m. Friday and lasted until 1:20 a.m. Saturday, created a sense of fear and confusion, jarring residents awake and flooding 911 with thousands of calls, officials said.    Sana Syed, a spokeswoman for the city, said in a telephone interview that the sound of the sirens, which are meant to alert the public to severe weather or other emergencies, was interpreted by some as a warning sign of a ''bomb or something, a missile.''    ''I can understand the concern,'' she said, noting the recent airstrikes in Syria.   Social media was flooded with complaints. ''Talk about creepy,'' wrote one user.   so all of Dallas tornado sirens have been going off for hours for no reason -- Dominick Marasa (@Dominick_Marasa) April 8, 2017   Officials declined to give full details about the nature of the breach, citing security reasons, but they said they believed it had originated locally.   ''We do believe it came from the Dallas area because of the proximity to our signal you need to have in order to pull it off,'' Ms. Syed said.   Mayor Mike Rawlings called the breach ''an attack on our emergency notification system'' and said it was evidence of a need to upgrade and safeguard the city's technology infrastructure.   ''We will work to identify and prosecute those responsible,'' he wrote on his Facebook page.   The alarms blasted for 90-second durations about 15 times, Rocky Vaz, the director of the city's Office of Emergency Management, told reporters at a news conference.   Mr. Vaz said emergency workers and technicians had to first figure out whether the sirens had been activated because of an actual emergency. And turning off the sirens also proved difficult, eventually prompting officials to shut down the entire system.   ''Every time we thought we had turned it off, the sirens would sound again, because whoever was hacking us was continuously hacking us,'' Ms. Syed said.   The system was still down on Saturday afternoon, and officials said they hoped to have it functional again by the end of the weekend. They said they had pinpointed the origin of the security breach after ruling out that the alarms had come from their control system or from remote access.   ''Talking to all the experts in the siren industry, in the field,'' Mr. Vaz said. ''This is a very rare event.''   Mr. Vaz said that Dallas had reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for help and was taking steps to prevent hackers from setting off the entire system again, but that city officials had not communicated with federal law enforcement authorities.   The city has had other recent struggles with its emergency systems. Its 911 system has had a problem with one phone carrier that has caused wait times as long as 26 minutes, The Dallas Morning News reported.   At least 4,400 calls came into the area's 911 system locally in the hours around the attack on Friday night, Ms. Syed said -- about double the amount normal overnight. The longest wait time was about six minutes, she said.   Security officials have warned for years about the risks that hacking attacks can pose to infrastructure. The number of attacks on critical infrastructure appears to have risen: to nearly 300 in 2015 from just under 200 in 2012, according to federal data. In 2013, hackers tied to the Iranian military tried to gain control of a small dam in upstate New York.     "
Can Putin influence the French election?,"Cécile Vaissié is a professor of Russian studies at Rennes II University and the author of ''Les Réseaux du Kremlin en France.'' This essay was translated by John Cullen from the French. PARIS -- Never, it is being said, has a presidential election in France seemed so uncertain. And never has there been so much concern about possible attempts by the Russian leadership to shape -- perhaps even interfere with -- the outcome. Last month, President François Hollande of France denounced the Kremlin's efforts to ''influence public opinion'' through ''ideological operations'' and its ''strategy of influence, of networks'' in France. His comments followed another accusation, by Richard Ferrand, the national secretary of the En Marche! (Onward!) movement, who claimed that the Kremlin was responsible for a series of cyberattacks against the party's website and that it was seeking to undermine Emmanuel Macron, En Marche!'s presidential candidate, for being, among other things, too pro-European Union. The Kremlin has denied this.    The French government is worried that hackings or cyberattacks may occur during the upcoming elections -- for president, in April and May, and for the national legislature, in June. Partly as a result, French nationals living abroad will not be allowed to vote electronically in the legislative election. (The option is never available for presidential elections.)    Computer breaches, propaganda, disinformation -- even campaign financing -- there are indeed many reasons to worry. And all the more so because the Kremlin's sapping offensive in France is a vast and long-running project.   The Russian authorities have set up at least three influential organizations here. Le Dialogue franco-russe (the Franco-Russian Dialogue) is an association created in 2004 under the auspices of Jacques Chirac, then president of France, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. It includes companies involved in trade between the two countries, and claims that its purpose is to develop ''economic cooperation and business relationships.'' More than anything, though, it seems to be making the case for lifting sanctions against Russia and promoting the Kremlin's geopolitical views. Le Dialogue franco-russe helped organize a conference about Syria on April 11, which was attended by the deputy foreign minister of Syria. According to the French secret services, the organization is ''infected'' with the Russian foreign intelligence service.   L'Institut de la démocratie et de la coopération (the Institute of Democracy and Cooperation) was set up in Paris in 2008. Its stated purpose is to create ''a bridge of solid friendship between two great European nations, France and Russia.'' Yet in numerous interviews its director, Natalia Narochnitskaya, has put forward very hostile views. The West wants to subjugate Russia, impose its rules on it, even ''dismember'' it, she has said, and to these ends it makes opportunistic use of human rights issues. For Ms. Narochnitskaya, Russia offers ''an alternative to the West.''   The Kremlin's third main proxy organization in France is the much less formal Forum des compatriotes (the Compatriots' Forum). It first convened in 2011 and brings together Russian-speaking émigrés and descendants of émigrés in meetings held at the Russian embassy in Paris. This forum, and others like it in other countries, are at the heart of Mr. Putin's ''Russian World'' initiative: an effort to mobilize the Russian diaspora for various linguistic, cultural or economic projects but also to build support for the Kremlin on such geopolitical questions as the war between Russia and Ukraine.   The leaders of these three organizations appear regularly in French news outlets and various media, in French and other languages, that the Kremlin has created and is wholly funding. The two most important of these, both active on social-media networks, are Sputnik and RT (Russia Today), which is to begin broadcasting in French this year.   Sputnik and RT have published numerous articles about, say, the problems ostensibly caused by immigrants, thereby reinforcing the fear and the backlash triggered by recent terrorist attacks. They do not hesitate to distort facts and even invent some. That technique, which used to be taught in some journalism schools in the former Soviet Union, seeks to create an emotional shock and suppress all capacity for analysis. By suggesting that facts don't matter, it also fuels conspiracy theories.   When it comes to the presidential election, Sputnik and RT attack Mr. Macron while supporting the candidacies of Marine Le Pen, of the far right, and François Fillon, of an increasingly hardening mainstream right. It was on Sputnik News (in English) that Nicolas Dhuicq -- a member of the Dialogue franco-russe's bureau and a representative from Mr. Fillon's party, Les Républicains, in the French National Assembly -- recently accused Mr. Macron of being ''an agent of the big American banking system'' and receiving the support of ''a very wealthy gay lobby.''   Backing from Russia can also be more concrete, particularly financial. So far only one such case is known in France, but it may not be unique. In 2014 Ms. Le Pen, the leader of the Front National party, received a loan of 9 million euros from the First Czech Russian Bank. (The bank, now in bankruptcy, counted Vyacheslav Babusenko, a former senior official in the K.G.B., among its principal directors.) A Cypriot company gave 2 million euros to Cotelec, the micro-party of Jean-Marie Le Pen, Ms. Le Pen's father and the Front National's former leader. The company appears to belong to a Russian national who owes his career to connections with the secret service, according to the Russian edition of Forbes magazine.   Were those transactions loans, or were they quid pro quos? The Front National has actively supported the Kremlin lately and stated that it is ''opposed to sanctions against Russia.'' Mr. Putin welcomed Ms. Le Pen to Moscow recently, saying he was ''very happy'' to see her. She has called him ''a man committed to values,'' in particular ''the Christian heritage of European civilization.''   French people, for their part, seem to be skeptical. In a 2015 poll (the most current on this issue), 85 percent of respondents did not trust Mr. Putin or his judgment in foreign policy. Between 2003 and 2015, respondents' level of trust in him plummeted from 48 percent to 15 percent.   But none of that makes much difference to Moscow. As a recent article in the newspaper Die Zeit convincingly demonstrated in the case of Germany, the central aim of the Kremlin's media outlets and networks is to foment fear and mistrust outside Russia and to undermine Westerners' faith in the security of their countries, the integrity of their institutions and the stability of their daily lives.   In a resolution last November, the European Parliament warned against ''Russian disinformation and propaganda warfare,'' calling it ''an integral part of modern hybrid warfare,'' itself ''a combination of military and nonmilitary measures of a covert and overt nature.'' That war really is underway.   Its goal is to build the ''post-West world order'' that Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, called for in a speech he gave in Munich in February. And anyone who is aware of Russia's internal situation -- generalized corruption, a nonperforming economy, widespread poverty, the obvious deterioration of political and civil liberties -- cannot but tremble at the prospect that Mr. Putin may have any influence on the presidential election in France.

Far-Right Activists in U.S. Promote Hacking Attack Against Macron,"After months of trying to move the political needle in favor of Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election, American far-right activists on Saturday threw their weight behind a  hacking attack against her rival, Emmanuel Macron, hoping to cast doubt on an election that is pivotal to France and the wider world. The efforts were the culmination of an extended campaign against Mr. Macron after his candidacy began to gain steam this year, with digital activists in the United States and elsewhere sharing tactics, tips and tricks across the English- and French-speaking parts of the internet.    It is unclear whether the leaked documents, which some experts say may be connected to hackers linked to Russia, will affect the outcome of the election on Sunday between Ms. Le Pen, the far-right candidate from the National Front, and Mr. Macron, an independent centrist. But the role of American far-right groups in promoting the breach online highlights their growing resolve to spread extremist messages beyond the United States.    ''It's the anti-globalists trying to go global,'' said Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow of the digital forensics research lab at the Atlantic Council, a think tank, who has studied the far right's recent efforts against Mr. Macron and others in France. ''There's a feeling of trying to export the revolution.''   The leak, which involved posting campaign documents like emails and accounting records to message boards, occurred late on Friday, hours before a legal prohibition on campaign communications went into effect across France. In response, Mr. Macron's team said the hackers had included fake information alongside authentic material ''to sow doubt.''   ''Intervening in the final hour of the official campaign, this operation is clearly a matter of democratic destabilization, as was seen in the United States during the last presidential campaign,'' Mr. Macron's campaign said in a statement late Friday, minutes before the communications prohibition went into effect.   By Saturday, a trail of digital crumbs appeared to tie the attack on Mr. Macron's campaign to Russian hackers. Forensics specialists found that one of the leaked Excel documents from Mr. Macron's campaign had been modified on a Russian version of Excel, and edited on Russian-language computers.   One document had last been modified by a Russian user named Roshka Georgiy Petrovich. Mr. Petrovich, 32, an employee of the Moscow-based Eureka CJSC, a Russian technology company, did not immediately return emails requesting comment. Eureka CJSC's clients include several Russian government agencies.   United States intelligence officials say that Russian government agencies regularly outsource political cyberattacks to Russian cybercriminals and top computer engineers. Security experts note that the digital crumbs could be the sloppy work of a Russian engineer, or studiously left as a so-called false flag used by hackers looking to mask their true identities and whereabouts.   Within hours after the hacked documents were made public, the hashtag #MacronLeaks began trending worldwide, aided by far-right activists in the United States who have been trying to sway the vote in favor of Ms. Le Pen.   Jack Posobiec, a journalist with the far-right news outlet The Rebel, was the first to use the hashtag with a link to the hacked documents online, which was then shared more widely by WikiLeaks. Mr. Posobiec remains the second-most mentioned individual on Twitter in connection with the hashtag behind WikiLeaks, according to a review of the past 100,000 Twitter posts published since late Friday.   While there is no evidence that the breach against Mr. Macron's campaign was organized by this loosely connected group of far-right campaigners, the American activists have been gathering on sites like 4chan and Discord, which were previously used to coordinate support for Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign.   One popular tactic, experts say, has been so-called Twitter raids, or efforts to hijack trending hashtags and topics on the social media site and inject far-right and anti-Macron propaganda.   A week before the second round of the French election, for instance, online activists, many from the United States and other English-speaking countries, flooded Twitter with coordinated anti-Macron memes -- online satirical photos with often biting captions -- carrying hashtags like #elysee2017 that were linked to the campaign. That included portraying him as a 21st-century equivalent of Marie Antoinette, the out-of-touch last queen of France before the French Revolution, while other memes made allegations of an extramarital affair.   ''They tried to bombard French Twitter with memes favorable to Le Pen,'' said Padraic Ryan, a project coordinator at Storyful, an online marketing company that tracks social media activity around news events. ''The campaigns are showing an increasing level of sophistication and coordination.''   Just days before the last French presidential debate, an anonymous user on 4chan, whose message boards include anti-Semitic, white supremacist and other far-right discussions,  posted what were said to be copies of documents showing that Mr. Macron had supposedly set up a bank account in the Bahamas to avoid paying taxes. He denied the allegations.   Ms. Le Pen referred to such an overseas bank account during the vicious debate, leading to a bitter rebuttal by Mr. Macron's team and an official investigation into the spread of the rumors.   The reports were followed with another accusation, also posted on 4chan, hours before Mr. Macron's campaign was subjected to the online leak, that he had bank accounts in the Cayman Islands. There is no evidence that he has such accounts.   Despite these increasingly coordinated digital efforts by far-right activists, analysts say, their efforts had not reached the vast majority of the French electorate -- until the Friday release of the hacked documents.   It will most likely take until after the election to review all the leaked documents. Under France's strict electoral rules, any publication of the material before polling day could lead to charges.   On Saturday, Le Monde, a French newspaper that has been fact-checking online information during the campaign,  posted a message below all of its articles about the election, saying that it would not disclose the contents of the breach until after the voting on Sunday. Le Monde said it did not want the leak to be used to disrupt the electoral process.   Yet as the French readied themselves for the election on Sunday, discussion on social media -- both in favor and in opposition of leaking the documents -- began to swirl, according to a review of Twitter data.   Since late Friday, Twitter hashtags related to the leak have topped the trending charts for France, a sign that people are talking about the leak, although most of the discussion has been limited to members of the far-right community who already support Ms. Le Pen.   Yet in a sign of how the far right outside the country is trying to foment the discussion, many of the Twitter posts about the hacking have originated in the United States, according to Trendsmap, a data analytics tool. About half of the social media messages around political hashtags linked to the breach have been written in English, based on a review of Trendsmap data, as activists outside France have helped to spread news of the leak.   The top 25 Twitter posts shared with the hashtag #MacronLeaks were written in English, according to Mr. Nimmo of the Atlantic Council, with many of the online accounts reposting links set up as so-called bots, or automated accounts controlled by third-party individuals.   Researchers from the University of Mary Washington also found that just 5 percent of Twitter accounts promoting the #MacronGate hashtag accounted for almost half of all the Twitter posts. The frequency of that activity, the security experts warned, was a telltale sign of bot activity, helping expand the reach of these posts on social networks.   Such activity ''has helped to push this leak entirely into the camp of the alt-right,'' Mr. Nimmo said on Saturday, referring to the online far-right community in the United States.   The French news media has been ordered by the electoral commission not to publish contents of the leaks. But the growth of digital misinformation and other falsities is likely to only grow in a season of elections in Europe in which British and German voters will soon head to the polls, said Janis Sarts, director of the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, a think tank in Riga, Latvia.   ''Misinformation is increasingly used to achieve political ends,'' Mr. Sarts said. ''Technology helps to amplify that message through fake news sites and social media.''     "
Why a Hacking Attack Failed to Sway the French Vote for President,"Follow Rachel Donadio on Twitter @RachelDonadio. PARIS -- Maybe it was the suspect timing of the leaked documents. Or the staggering amount and possibility that some were fake. Or a feeling among the French that, having witnessed how hacking may have altered the American election, they would not fall for the same ploy. Whatever the reasons, newspapers and broadcasters in France have so far conspicuously avoided reporting any details of what was described on Friday night as a ''massive'' pre-election hacking attack on Emmanuel Macron's campaign.    The bereft coverage extended into Monday night, well after a 44-hour legal ban on election reporting surrounding the Sunday vote had lifted.   By then it was clear that the hacked material -- regardless of what it might contain -- had caused no ill effects on the campaign of Mr. Macron, who won decisively over the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.    The contrast with the United States presidential campaign was sharp: Hacking of Hillary Clinton that was traced to Russia may have played a role in her defeat by Donald J. Trump, but news of the hacking in France was met with silence, disdain and scorn.   The contrast may have been amplified further by the absence of a French equivalent to the thriving tabloid culture in Britain or the robust right-wing broadcast media in the United States, where the Clinton hacking attack generated enormous negative coverage.   ''We don't have a Fox News in France,'' said Johan Hufnagel, managing editor of the leftist daily Libération. ''There's no broadcaster with a wide audience and personalities who build this up and try to use it for their own agendas.''   He also said that French voters, with the benefit of hindsight, were suspicious of destabilizing developments like the ones that may have affected the vote in the American presidential election and Britain's so-called Brexit referendum last June to leave the European Union.   ''French voters didn't want to get into that game,'' Mr. Hufnagel said. ''They were mentally prepared after Trump and Brexit and the Russians, even if it's not clear they're behind it.''   Some Macron supporters initially feared that the reports of the hacking and his inability to respond could be devastating on the eve of voting.   The hacking lit up social media, especially in the United States, where  far-right activists have joined together to spread extremist messages in Europe.   On Election Day, the French-language version of Sputnik, the Russian news outlet, played up social media coverage of the leaks.   But the leaks did not get much traction in France, where news outlets respected the blackout. The documents landed at the 11th hour, without time for journalists to scrutinize them before the ban went into effect.   The news media also heeded an admonition by the government's campaign regulatory body not to publish false news. Mr. Macron's campaign said that fake documents had been mixed in with authentic ones.   There were also reports that Mr. Macron's campaign, well aware that it was a hacking target, had deliberately fed hackers false information in responding to phishing emails, which may explain why the leaked data was disseminated late in the campaign.   ''You can flood these addresses with multiple passwords and logins, true ones, false ones, so the people behind them use up a lot of time trying to figure them out,'' The Daily Beast quoted Mounir Mahjoubi, the head of Mr. Macron's digital team, as saying.    Mr. Hufnagel said that Libération would take time to evaluate and verify the leaked documents before writing any articles.   Le Monde, the country's leading daily, said in an article published Saturday that it would also scrutinize the leaked material before writing.   ''If those documents contain revelations, Le Monde, of course, will publish them, after having investigated in accordance with our journalistic and ethical rules, without letting ourselves be manipulated by the publishing agenda of anonymous actors,'' the newspaper said.   After that blackout ended Sunday night, most news outlets said only that the French authorities had opened an investigation.   That reticence stretched across the landscape of newspapers in France, regardless of political leaning. Several weekly newsmagazines -- the conservative Le Point, the centrist L'Express and the left-leaning L'Obs -- also held back.   The Macron campaign has said little about the hacking and leaks beyond a statement late Friday night -- just minutes before the blackout began -- describing the operation as ''massive and coordinated'' and an effort to destabilize French democracy.   For now, it appears the attack turned up mostly mundane documents. Although the coverage has hardly been comprehensive, no real smoking guns have been uncovered.   ''The good news is that there was an attempt at destabilization that didn't work,'' said Céline Pigalle, the top editor at BFM-TV, a private broadcaster. ''The elements weren't strong enough. But what would have happened if they had been?''   Ms. Pigalle said the late-breaking document dump provided a reason to revise the news blackout law. It was created to give citizens time to reflect before voting, but in the era of social media, it gives anyone with a Twitter account an edge over France's respected news outlets.   ''It denies the world as it exists today, when social media don't stop,'' she said.   The National Front, Ms. Le Pen's party, has a vexed relationship with the mainstream news media, which it has at once scorned and used.   Ms. Le Pen and her aides have at times floated conspiracy theories, asserting -- without evidence -- that Mr. Macron had an offshore bank account, for instance. But her campaign did not have enough time after news of the hacking attack became public to seize on any damaging findings.   Just before the campaign blackout deadline, a senior National Front official, Florian Philippot, said on Twitter: ''Will Macron leaks teach us things that investigative journalism deliberately killed? It's shocking, this shipwreck of democracy.''   But his message came across as a last-minute act of desperation. On a popular morning radio show on France Inter on Monday, the journalist Léa Salamé asked a National Front official, Nicolas Bay, about Mr. Philippot's post on Twitter. Mr. Bay said that the methods used to disseminate the Macron campaign documents might be questionable, but that it was important to discover their contents. The conversation ended there.   The National Front does not have the equivalent of a Bill O'Reilly or a Sean Hannity, the right-wing commentators who helped shore up Mr. Trump's presidential bid. While French commentators such as Éric Zemmour, a regular on radio and television who has a column in Le Figaro, have fed into a sense of decline and insecurity that the National Front tried to capitalize on politically, neither he nor other so-called neo-reactionary commentators endorsed the far-right party.   In the United States, reaction to the Macron leaks was more animated, and Hillary Clinton took to Twitter to comment. ''Victory for Macron, for France, the EU, & the world. Defeat to those interfering w/democracy. (But the media says I can't talk about that).''     "
International Espionage on a Budget: Qatar Cyberattacks Point to a New Reality,"DOHA, Qatar -- The report appeared just after midnight on the official Qatari news agency's website, and its contents were stunning: The emir of Qatar was quoted as describing ''tensions'' with President Trump and speculating he may not last in office, recommending friendship with Iran, praising the Palestinian militants of Hamas, and then attesting to his own ''good'' relations with Israel. The contradictory statements could hardly have been better contrived to alienate the United States and Arab countries around the Gulf, and Qatar immediately began to deny the report, early on May 24. But within 20 minutes, satellite networks controlled by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had seized on the damning news flash and began interviewing long lines of well-prepared commentators to expound on the perfidy of Qatar.    The Qatari government said the news agency had been hacked, a claim now supported by the F.B.I. and British law enforcement officials. Though they would not say so publicly, Qatari officials blamed the Saudis and Emiratis.    Probably not coincidentally, a few days later, emails hacked from the Emirates' ambassador to Washington began turning up in the Western news media and then the Qatari news network Al Jazeera.   The cyber-intrigue was the opening skirmish in a pitched battle among ostensible Gulf allies this week. Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. rallied dependent Arab states to cut off diplomatic relations, travel and trade with Qatar, and the unity of the American-backed alliance against the Islamic State and Iran has been fractured.   But the dirty tricks also heralded a broader transformation in international espionage. The dust-up in the Gulf is the clearest sign yet that cyberattacks coupled with disinformation campaigns are no longer the exclusive domain of sophisticated powers like Russia. Any country can get in the game for the relatively low price of a few freelance hackers.   The F.B.I. and other experts concluded the hack of Qatar's news agency was the result of a computer break-in, and was most likely carried out by Russian hackers for hire, according to American and Qatari officials briefed on the investigation. F.B.I. officials told The New York Times that Russian mercenary hackers have frequently come up in investigations of attacks sponsored by nation-states.   In fact, the hacking war in the Gulf region has likely been going on for years, though it has never played out on such a public stage. In 2015, for example, an Arab intermediary with ties to Qatar provided The Times with internal emails from the Emirati Foreign Ministry which stated that the U.A.E. was knowingly violating a United Nations resolution by shipping weapons to Libyan militias.   ''The fact of the matter is that the U.A.E. violated the U.N. Security Council Resolution on Libya and continues to do so,'' Ahmed al-Qasimi, a senior Emirati diplomat, wrote in an internal email that was dated Aug. 4, 2015, and provided to The Times. Other internal Emirati emails about Libyan dealings and North Korean arms deals surfaced through Qatari-linked websites and the Guardian newspaper.   Qatar has, at times, backed its own Libyan client militias on the other side of a three-year proxy war against the U.A.E -- with both sides confounding Western attempts to broker a unity government in Libya.   In a report scheduled to be released on Friday, two independent cybersecurity researchers claim that at least one group of hackers can be found working as freelancers for a number of Gulf states, and that their methods bear a striking resemblance to the methods used to hack the Emirati ambassador.   ''They seem to be hackers-for-hire, freelancing for all sorts of different clients, and adapting their skills as needed,'' said Collin Anderson, who is one of the researchers. Mr. Anderson and his partner, Claudio Guarnieri, have nicknamed the group Bahamut, after a monstrous fish floating in the Arabian Sea in the Jorge Luis Borges novel ''Book of Imaginary Beings.''   The group regularly uses spear phishing attacks -- emails designed to look innocent but contain malicious software applications. While it is not yet clear if Bahamut was behind the hack of the ambassador's email, the group targeted a number of Emirati diplomats as well as other public figures in the Gulf region.   Other news organizations have reported receiving leaked Emirati emails from a group calling itself GlobalLeaks and using email addressing ending in .ru, suggesting the mercenary hackers may be Russians or wish to pose as Russian.   The Emirati ambassador, Yousef al-Otaiba, is well known for his assiduous efforts to convince American think tanks and government officials that Qatar had threatened the stability of the region by cheering the Arab uprisings of 2011 and, in particular, by backing the Muslim Brotherhood.   Mr. Otaiba, a charismatic figure who speaks nearly native-sounding English, has also served as a personal tutor in regional politics to Jared Kushner, the son-in-law and a senior adviser to President Trump.   Several of the newly leaked emails appear to include examples of Mr. Otaiba pressing anti-Qatari arguments with American officials, who banter with him like old friends.   In a Feb. 10, 2015, exchange between Mr. Otaiba and Elliott Abrams, a former Republican White House official, Mr. Abrams appears to joke about the Emirates' support for the military coup that removed Egypt's Qatari-allied Islamist president in 2013, almost suggesting that something similar should happen in Qatar. ''Too bad the Qatari armed forces can't... well, I shouldn't say such things. That would be undemocratic,'' the email said.   In another leaked exchange, John Hannah, another former Republican White House official, who is now with the pro-Israel Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, emailed Mr. Otaiba to complain that an Emirati-owned hotel in Doha was providing space for a Hamas news conference.   ''How's this,'' Ambassador Otaiba replied. ''You move the base then we'll move the hotel :-).'' (He was obliquely referring to the major American air base in Qatar, Al Udeid, that has been the headquarters for operations against the Islamic State. )   In fact, on Thursday, the government of Qatar listed the hacking attack as part of a broader public influence campaign that has been appearing in American newspapers and think tank conferences. A timeline the government distributed to reporters, identified a series of 14 op-ed articles that appeared across the American media in a sudden flurry beginning around the same time -- late April -- all singling out Qatar for supporting Islamist militants or extremists.   President Trump arrived in the region on May 20, weeks after the barrage of criticism began, for an Arab summit in Saudi Arabia. ''He told us exactly: 'We have to work together in stopping the funding of extremist groups in the region and whenever I read reports about this region I read about Qatar and Saudi,' '' the Qatari foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, recalled on Thursday.   ''Mr. President,'' the foreign minister said he replied, ''are the reports based on media reports or intelligence reports? If it is based on media reports, then this is something we cannot answer.''   ''We assured them that we have strong cooperation with our security agencies,'' the foreign minister added.   Then, three days after the Trump meeting in Riyadh, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies held a conference in Washington dedicated to criticism of Qatar, titled ''Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood's Global Affiliates.''   Robert M. Gates, the former defense secretary and a friend of Mr. Otaiba, gave the keynote. Attendees included many of the authors of the critical op-ed articles and senior Obama administration officials. Organizers encouraged Mr. Otaiba to attend, and his staff sent Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital, a detailed report.   The hack of the Qatari news agency took place after midnight that night.   Mr. Anderson, the cyber security researcher, said the low cost and relative ease of hiring hackers meant that more such attacks would surely follow.   ''This is the future for what countries all around the world can do,'' he said, ''if they have the money and the resources.''   By Thursday night, Qatar's Al Jazeera network reported that hackers were attempting to overload and crash its internet servers.     "
"As 'Game of Thrones' Returns, Is Sharing Your HBO Password O.K.?","The seventh season of ''Game of Thrones'' returns on Sunday, and if you're like a significant chunk of HBO's viewership, you can watch it thanks to the login credentials tracing back to your friend's ex-boyfriend's parents. But if you listened to the headlines after a court decision last July, you might fear a SWAT team could bust down your door in the middle of your illicit ''Veep'' episode. Countless news sites reported that sharing your password would be a ''federal crime,'' while others suggested you might ''go to jail'' for it.     The less hysteric truth is more complicated but experts largely agree: You are in very little danger of legal trouble by sharing your password or using a shared one. The laws remain murky, but the government is unlikely to prosecute you, and the streaming video services have shown no desire to go after customers.   (We're not saying you should use someone else's password. As an ethical issue, it's probably a good idea to pay for it. The same goes for news.)   But so far, Netflix, HBO, Amazon, Hulu and other streaming companies have indicated that they're either quietly accepting of the practice or possibly even cheering it on as a marketing strategy.   Why the government most likely won't come after you   In 2016, two court decisions led some to conclude that password sharing is illegal, but whether the decisions apply to your Netflix account remains in dispute.   In one case, United States v. Nosal, a three-judge panel ruled in July that a former employee of an executive search firm illegally gained access to the company's computers by using login credentials that had been willingly supplied by a current employee. Two of the judges found that the former employee had defied a ban on ''access without authorization'' in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a 1986 anti-hacking law.   In the dissent, Judge Stephen Reinhardt said the decision could be applied to everyday password sharing.   ''If we interpret 'without authorization' in a way that includes common practices like password sharing, millions of our citizens would become potential federal criminals overnight,'' he wrote.   But the majority opinion disputed the sentiment, dismissing fears as hypotheticals while writing that ''this appeal is not about password sharing.'' Much of the media coverage focused on the dissenting opinion.   In a separate case, Facebook v. Power Ventures, the social media company filed a lawsuit against an aggregator for logging into Facebook via user accounts after the company received a cease-and-desist order. The court decided that Power Ventures could not have access even though users had given the company their login credentials.   Legal experts have said both cases leave a lot of uncertainty.   ''A lot of times you get legal clarity when there are cases,'' said Orin Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University who represented Power Ventures. ''We just don't have cases because the government doesn't prosecute password-sharing cases, or hasn't, and the companies have not brought lawsuits either. So we just don't know.''   Jamie Williams, a staff lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the organization is among those seeking clarity from the Supreme Court.   ''As a technical matter, it is illegal,'' Ms. Williams said. ''Will the federal government prosecute you for it? Probably not.''   Why the companies most likely won't come after you   Netflix, HBO, Hulu and Amazon declined to comment for this story. But in past statements, the companies have indicated they're not too worried about the trend.   In an October 2016 earnings call, Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, said there were no plans to change the company's practices on sharing.   ''Password sharing is something you have to learn to live with, because there's so much legitimate password sharing, like you sharing with your spouse, with your kids,'' he said. ''So there's no bright line, and we're doing fine as is.''   Richard Plepler, the chief executive of HBO, told CNN in April 2015 that ''right now password sharing is just simply not a big number.''   ''Should it become a big number, we will deal with it,'' he said. ''We will change the number of concurrent streams that are available. But right now, the number really isn't significant.''   A Reuters/Ipsos poll this month found 12 percent of streaming viewers had used someone else's password to gain access to one of the services. That number rose to 21 percent among people ages 18 to 24.   The effect on the companies' bottom lines remains unclear, but a study by Parks Associates, a research group, found that sharing cost the streaming video industry $500 million in 2015.   One reason the companies appear hesitant to police the passwords harder: Freeloaders could become the next customers.   ''We could crack down on it, but you wouldn't suddenly turn all those folks to paid users,'' Netflix's chief financial officer David Wells said in September, according to Reuters.   But again, those pesky ethics   Sharing passwords can inspire a similar sense of inner turmoil that people felt in the 2000s, when services like Napster and Kazaa allowed music and movie lovers to download full albums and movies at will, never paying a dime.   That time, the entertainment industry fought back. The Recording Industry Association of America targeted thousands of file-sharers who had illegally downloaded music and movies. (Those lawsuits were focused on copyright infringement, not password sharing, and there's been no indication the streaming services would follow a similar legal path.)   In both cases, there might be a lingering sense that if you like the content enough to be watching it, you ought to pay a bit of money so the creators can keep creating things like it.     "
The Hacking Wars Will Get Worse,"Adam Segal, a cybersecurity scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, is the author of ''The Hacked World Order: How Nations Fight, Trade, Maneuver and Manipulate in the Digital Age.'' Reports this month that the United Arab Emirates orchestrated the hacking of a Qatari news agency, helping to incite a crisis in the Middle East, are as unsurprising as they are unwelcome. For years, countries -- in particular Russia -- have used cyberattacks and the dissemination of disinformation through social media and news outlets to provoke protests, sway elections and undermine trust in institutions. It was only a matter of time before smaller states tried their hand at these tactics. With few accepted rules of behavior in cyberspace, countries as big as China or as small as Bahrain can be expected to use these kinds of attacks. And they may eventually spill over into real-world military conflicts.     The hacking attacks in the Gulf seem to follow a typical pattern of going after the media and the email accounts of prominent individuals. According to  American intelligence officials, in late May, hackers supported by the United Arab Emirates infiltrated Qatari government news and social media sites. The attackers planted quotations falsely attributed to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, Qatar's leader, praising Iran, Hamas and Israel.   It's unclear if the Emirates undertook the hacking or  hired freelancers to do the dirty work. (Emirati officials have denied playing any role.) But either way, the objective was achieved. The Emirati government, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, used the planted quotations as a pretext to ban Qatari news outlets and to break off diplomatic and trade relations with Qatar. The countries presented Qatar with a list of 13 demands for resolving the crisis, including cutting ties with Iran, closing a Turkish military base in Qatar and closing the Qatari-financed network Al Jazeera. Qatari officials called the demands an infringement on their country's sovereignty. Tensions continue as American and Turkish officials try to mediate a resolution.   The hacking and disinformation attack on Qatar is not unprecedented. In August 2012, for example, the Indian government accused Pakistani hackers of trying to provoke communal violence. One part of the cyberassault involved posting pictures on websites of corpses described as people killed by Muslims in India's northeast. (In fact, they were manipulated photos of casualties from an earthquake in Tibet.) The hackers also sent text messages warning that an attack on students and workers from northeastern India living in Mumbai and Bangalore was imminent. Thousands of migrants began a panicked flight back to their homes.   More recently, in June, hackers believed to be tied to the Vietnamese government stole and released transcripts of the talks between President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and President Trump, and between Mr. Duterte and President Xi Jinping of China. The timing of the leak suggests that Vietnam, which along with several other Southeast Asian countries is involved in disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea, hoped to pressure Mr. Duterte and sabotage the Philippines' relations with China.   There is little to stop other countries from trying similar influence operations. These tactics are cheap, and they are easily deniable. None of the victims -- including the United States and its European allies -- have come up with a way to impose significant consequences on the attackers. For example, the Obama administration expelled Russian diplomats, seized diplomatic compounds and imposed sanctions in retaliation for the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Still, American officials say they expect to see Russian hackers return for the 2018 elections.   In addition, efforts to define international rules of cyberconflict lag far behind the use of attacks. In two previous meetings, a group of government experts convened by the United Nations decided that the United Nations Charter applies in cyberspace and that cyberattacks on critical infrastructure and computer emergency response teams should be off limits during peacetime. But the most recent round of negotiations on the topic ended with participants unable to agree whether international law applied to cyberspace.   It's only a matter of time before a state's response to a cyberattack escalates into full-blown military conflict. Cyberattacks that embarrass or threaten the legitimacy of weak leaders, for example, could cause them to overreact -- or worse to unleash a war to create a diversion.   Big and small countries alike should want to make sure that hacking attacks do not lead to war. But there is little hope that competing states will ever be able to agree on how to define, much less limit, information operations.   For now, the onus is on individual states to identify vulnerable targets, better defend them, and, if and when an attack succeeds, counter the spread of lies and disinformation. Countries should also work with like-minded partners to detail what types of interference will provoke what types of reactions, from sanctions to retaliatory cyberattacks. As the latest crisis in the Gulf shows, small states are learning from the big ones how to exploit cyberattacks to create political disruption. As a result, we all are much less secure in cyberspace -- and in the real world, too.

Hackers Briefly Seize HBO's Twitter Account in the Latest in a Series of Breaches,"Several of HBO's Twitter accounts were hacked late Wednesday night, raising further security concerns at a moment when the premium cable channel has been dealing with the sustained leaking of proprietary information.  A group that identified itself as OurMine infiltrated HBO's main Twitter account and accounts for TV shows like ''Game of Thrones'' and ''Girls.''    In two tweets posted to several of HBO's accounts, the hackers wrote ''we are just testing your security'' and ''let's make #HBOHacked trending!''   #HBOHacked pic.twitter.com/w7sXYizLsB -- Hemaang (@JrSehgal) August 17, 2017   It did not last long. HBO appeared to have reclaimed control of the accounts and had deleted the hacker's tweets within an hour of the breach.   There is nothing unique about major companies' social media accounts getting hacked, but the incident on Wednesday night comes after a single hacker has tormented HBO since the beginning of the month. In emails to the news media in recent weeks, the hacker, who identifies himself as ''Mr. Smith,'' has released propriety information, including emails of one HBO executive and unaired episodes of shows like ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' ''Ballers'' and ''Insecure.'' It is unclear how widely those episodes have circulated online.   But that's not the end of it. Two unaired episodes of ''Game of Thrones'' were also leaked online this month, including one set to broadcast on Sunday, though neither leak was related to the wider breach.   It also did not appear that Wednesday night's Twitter hacking was related to the Mr. Smith attack. OurMine has been responsible for hacking several major companies, including YouTube, Marvel and Netflix.   ''We are investigating,'' a spokesman for the network said.   In addition to the hacking, HBO has also recently dealt with a prolonged social media backlash for ''Confederate,'' an alternate history drama about slavery from the creators of ''Game of Thrones'' that is currently in development.

States Resist Hackers on Their Own,"As Washington ignores the danger, state election officials have finally begun facing up to the threat of Russian hackers and other troublemakers infiltrating the American voting process in the midterm and presidential elections.  There have been months of apparent indifference in many state election offices, despite stern warnings from federal security experts that hackers will be back for more after their 2016 meddling. But now state election officials have begun trying to tighten the security of outdated, vulnerable balloting systems. These systems were last updated after the hanging-chad debacle of the 2000 election, before internet hackers were a powerful threat.    These officials have been prodded awake in part by the federal Department of Homeland Security's cautionary designation this year of election systems as critical infrastructure, on par with the electrical grid and banking in needing special protection.   Among the states, Colorado and Rhode Island are introducing an advanced statistical system called a risk-limiting audit to protect vote tallies from falsification. West Virginia has hired a computer security expert; Delaware plans a total revamping, including junking an electronic voting system that does not leave a paper trail for verification.   Beyond fitful attempts to fix flaws, wary state officials have begun conferring more closely  with federal and private election specialists. One encouraging result has been a thorough revamping of guidelines for manufacturers of voting equipment, which have already been endorsed by 47 states. The modernized guidelines require that new machines have the verifiable paper records still lacking in too many jurisdictions, and that the systems be well protected from the ultimate threat of doctored vote tallies.   Whether such vital changes arrive in time for the 2018 elections is an open question in the nation's crazy-quilt of 8,000 state and county systems and 100,000 polling places. The answer is dependent on a far greater financial and political investment than has been made thus far by state and federal governments. It's already clear that, even with the Kremlin's blatant intrusion, there will be no repetition of the nearly $4 billion package of state aid for election reform that Washington approved after the 2000 election. This time, estimates run into modest hundred millions for needed reforms. There are bipartisan congressional proposals, like the Paper Act, circulating to help states develop stronger election protections, with grants for new technology.   The situation cries out for national leadership as the elections approach. But voters can't expect help from President Trump. Nor are congressional Republicans any help, bent as they are on nonexistent voter fraud as a more credible challenge than Kremlin hackers. Now that the states are accepting that the threat is real, they must work all the harder to protect the voting machinery that underpins the public's confidence in democracy itself.

Trump Team Got Early Word Of Russian 'Dirt' on Clinton,"WASHINGTON -- The guilty plea of a 30-year-old campaign aide -- so green that he listed Model United Nations in his qualifications -- shifted the narrative on Monday of the Trump campaign's interactions with Russia: Court documents revealed that Russian officials alerted the campaign, through an intermediary in April 2016, that they possessed thousands of Democratic emails and other ''dirt'' on Hillary Clinton. That was two months before the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee was publicly revealed and the stolen emails began to appear online. The new court filings provided the first clear evidence that Trump campaign aides had early knowledge that Russia had stolen confidential documents on Mrs. Clinton and the committee, a tempting trove in a close presidential contest.    By the time of a crucial meeting in June of last year, when Donald Trump Jr. and other senior Trump campaign officials met with a Russian lawyer offering damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, some may have known for weeks that Russia had material likely obtained by illegal hacking, the new documents suggested. The disclosures added to the evidence pointing to attempts at collaboration between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, but they appeared to fall short of proof that they conspired in the hacking or other illegal acts.    The improbable figure at the center of the new information was a ''foreign policy adviser'' to Mr. Trump, George Papadopoulos. It was Mr. Papadopoulos, one of three men whose charges were announced on Monday, who appears to have been the first campaign aide to learn about the Russian hacking of Democratic targets.   A crucial detail is still missing: Whether and when Mr. Papadopoulos told senior Trump campaign officials about Russia's possession of hacked emails. And it appears that the young aide's quest for a deeper connection with Russian officials, while he aggressively pursued it, led nowhere.   Mr. Papadopoulos repeatedly promoted the idea of a ''history making'' meeting between Mr. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. Senior campaign officials, however, said that Mr. Trump should not make the trip and leave it to someone ''low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal,'' according to an email cited in court documents.   Mr. Papadopoulos then proposed that he himself, perhaps with another campaign official, travel to Moscow to meet with the Russians.   ''The trip proposed by defendant PAPADOPOULOS did not take place,'' prosecutors wrote.   To grasp the significance of Monday's developments, it helps to recall exactly how the Russian attack unfolded.   In September 2015, the F.B.I. made its first call to the Democratic National Committee to report evidence of Russian hackers inside the committee's network. But for seven months, the word never got beyond an I.T. contractor, and the hackers apparently had the run of confidential emails and other files.   During that time, Mr. Trump was pressed to assemble a team of foreign policy advisers, a difficult task because he was shunned by many Republicans who had served in earlier administrations. In early March, Mr. Papadopoulos, who had been helping the beleaguered campaign of Dr. Ben Carson, offered his services to the Trump campaign.   Around March 6, documents say, a campaign supervisor -- identified by a former Trump adviser as Sam Clovis -- told Mr. Papadopoulos, then living in London, that ''a principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved relationship with Russia.''   A week later, traveling in Italy, Mr. Papadopoulos encountered a London-based professor of international relations, Joseph Mifsud, who claimed to have ''substantial connections with Russian government officials.'' (The court documents do not name Mr. Mifsud, but a Senate aide briefed on the case identified him as the professor in question.)   Unimpressed by Mr. Papadopoulos at first, Mr. Mifsud became far more interested when he learned that the young traveler was working for the Trump campaign. The two men met again in London on March 24, when the professor introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to a Russian woman he said was a relative of Mr. Putin with close ties to senior Russian officials.   The same week, Mr. Trump, visiting The Washington Post, was pressed to name his foreign policy team. He read out five names, most of them with modest or nonexistent public profiles -- including Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos began emailing campaign officials about his new contacts with his ''good friend'' Mr. Mifsud and the Russian woman, whom he incorrectly believed was Mr. Putin's niece, and the possibility of a Trump-Putin meeting.   On March 31, back in Washington, Mr. Papadopoulos met Mr. Trump for the first time at a gathering of his new foreign policy team at the candidate's Washington hotel. According to the former Trump adviser who was there, and who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid offending former colleagues, Mr. Papadopoulos spoke for a few minutes about his Russian contacts and the prospects for a meeting with the Russian president.   But several people in the room began to raise questions about the wisdom of a meeting with Mr. Putin, noting that Russia was under sanctions from the United States. Jeff Sessions, now attorney general and then a senator from Alabama who was counseling Mr. Trump on national security, ''shut George down,'' the adviser said. ''He said, 'We're not going to do it' and he added, 'I'd prefer that nobody speak about this again.'''   But Mr. Papadopoulos was not deterred, the documents say, and he continued to communicate with Mr. Mifsud and the Russian woman about more contacts. The Russian woman wrote on April 11, ''we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump.'' Mr. Mifsud introduced Mr. Papadopoulos over email to a Moscow contact who said he had connections to the Russian foreign ministry. They spoke repeatedly over Skype about a possible Moscow trip, the documents say.   On April 26 came a crucial meeting. At breakfast at a London hotel, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos that he had just returned from Moscow, where he had ''learned that the Russians had obtained 'dirt' on then-candidate Clinton.'' Mr. Mifsud said he had been told the Russians had ''thousands of emails.''   On May 4, the Russian contact with ties to the foreign ministry wrote to Mr. Papadopoulos and Mr. Mifsud, saying ministry officials were ''open for cooperation.'' Mr. Papadopoulos forwarded the message to a senior campaign official, asking whether the contacts were ''something we want to move forward with.''   The court documents describe in detail how Mr. Papadopoulos continued to report to senior campaign officials on his efforts to arrange meetings with Russian officials, which The Washington Post reported on in August. But the documents do not say explicitly whether, and to whom, he passed on his most explosive discovery -- that the Russians had what they considered compromising emails on Mr. Trump's opponent.   J.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon official who worked for the Trump campaign as a national security adviser and helped arrange the March 31 foreign policy meeting, said he had known nothing about Mr. Papadopoulos' discovery that Russia had obtained Democratic emails or of his prolonged pursuit of meetings with Russians.   ''I was surprised to learn what George Papadopoulos was up to during the campaign,'' Mr. Gordon said in a text message. ''He obviously went to great lengths to go around me and Senator Sessions.''   Mr. Gordon said that such end-runs around normal channels are common in presidential campaigns. ''It's very hard to know what every single person is doing, especially since some folks deliberately go around the chain of command,'' he said. ''But George Papadopoulos obviously represents an extreme case.''   Prosecutors may have deliberately left salient details out of the documents filed in court to protect the continuing investigation. But what they did say portrays Mr. Papadopoulos as continuing for months to arrange meetings with Russian officials. As late as August 2016, Mr. Papadopoulos was advised by a campaign official, apparently Mr. Clovis, to travel to Moscow ''if it is feasible.''   Instead of opening a new era in relations with Russia, Mr. Papadopoulos found himself caught up in the investigation of the Russian interference in the American election. The documents accuse him of lying to F.B.I. agents in two interviews, first on Jan. 27 and then on Feb. 16, when he ''reiterated his purported willingness to cooperate with the F.B.I.'s investigation,'' according to an affidavit filed by Robert M. Gibbs, an F.B.I. agent investigating the case.   On Feb. 17, the agent wrote, Mr. Papadopoulos shut down the Facebook account he had used since 2005, including to exchange messages with the intermediaries for Russia. Prosecutors considered that to be obstruction of justice, and it became part of the case that concluded Oct. 5 when Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to make a false statement to the F.B.I., which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.

"Putin Led Scheme to Aid Trump, Report Says","WASHINGTON -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a vast cyberattack aimed at denying Hillary Clinton the presidency and installing Donald J. Trump in the Oval Office, the nation's top intelligence agencies said in an extraordinary report they delivered on Friday to Mr. Trump. The officials presented their unanimous conclusions to Mr. Trump in a two-hour briefing at Trump Tower in New York that brought the leaders of America's intelligence agencies face to face with their most vocal skeptic, the president-elect, who has repeatedly cast doubt on Russia's role. The meeting came just two weeks before Mr. Trump's inauguration and was underway even as the electoral votes from his victory were being formally counted in a joint session of Congress.    Soon after leaving the meeting, intelligence officials released the declassified,  damning report that described the sophisticated cybercampaign as part of a continuing Russian effort to weaken the United States government and its democratic institutions. The report -- a virtually unheard-of, real-time revelation by the American intelligence agencies that undermined the legitimacy of the president who is about to direct them -- made the case that Mr. Trump was the favored candidate of Mr. Putin.    The Russian leader, the report said, sought to denigrate Mrs. Clinton, and the report detailed what the officials had revealed to President Obama a day earlier: Mr. Trump's victory followed a complicated, multipart cyberinformation attack whose goal had evolved to help the Republican win.   The 25-page report did not conclude that Russian involvement tipped the election to Mr. Trump.   The public report lacked the evidence that intelligence officials said was included in a classified version, which they described as information on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates. Those would include intercepts of conversations and the harvesting of computer data from ''implants'' that the United States and its allies have put in Russian computer networks.   Much of the unclassified report focused instead on an overt Kremlin propaganda campaign that would be unlikely to convince skeptics of the report's more serious conclusions.   The report may be a political blow to Mr. Trump. But it is also a risky moment for the intelligence agencies that have become more powerful since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but have had to fend off allegations that they exaggerated intelligence during the buildup to the Iraq war.   The declassified report did describe in detail the efforts of Mr. Putin and his security services, including the creation of the online Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release information gained from the hacks to the public.   ''Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,'' the report by the nation's intelligence agencies concluded.   Mr. Trump, whose resistance to that very conclusion has led him to repeatedly mock the country's intelligence services on Twitter since Election Day, issued a written statement that appeared to concede some Russian involvement. But Mr. Trump said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin had sought to aid his candidacy, other than insisting that he still believes the Russian attacks had no effect on the outcome.   The president-elect's written statement came just hours after Mr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview that the storm surrounding Russian hacking was nothing more than a ''political witch hunt'' carried out by his adversaries, who he said were embarrassed by their loss to him in the 2016 election. Speaking by telephone three hours before the intelligence briefing, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intense focus on Russia.   ''China, relatively recently, hacked 20 million government names,'' he said, referring to the breach of computers at the Office of Personnel Management in late 2014 and early 2015. ''How come nobody even talks about that? This is a political witch hunt.''   Later, Mr. Trump sought to blame the Democrats for any cyberattacks that might have occurred. ''Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place,'' he said in a Twitter message posted about 11 p.m. ''The Republican National Committee had strong defense!''   Vice President-elect Mike Pence told reporters that he and Mr. Trump had ''appreciated the presentation'' by the intelligence officials and described the conversation as ''respectful.'' Mr. Pence said the new administration would take aggressive action ''to combat cyberattacks and protect the security of the American people from this type of intrusion in the future.''   Mr. Trump, who has consistently questioned the evidence of Russian hacking during the election, did so again Friday before he met with the intelligence officials. Asked why he thought there was so much attention on the Russian cyberattacks, the president-elect said the motivation was political.   He also repeated his criticism of the American intelligence agencies, saying that ''a lot of mistakes were made'' in the past, noting in particular the attacks on the World Trade Center and saying, as he has repeatedly, that ''weapons of mass destruction was one of the great mistakes of all time.''   But after meeting with the intelligence officials, Mr. Trump appeared to moderate his position, conceding that ''Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyberinfrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations, including the Democrat National Committee.''   The report described a broad campaign of covert operations, including the ''trolling'' on the internet of people who were viewed as opponents of Russia's effort. While it accused Russian intelligence agencies of obtaining and maintaining ''access to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards,'' it concluded -- as officials have publicly -- that there was no evidence of tampering with the tallying of the vote on Nov. 8.   The report, reflecting the assessments of the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, stopped short of backing up Mr. Trump on his declaration that the hacking activity had no effect on the election.   ''We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,'' the report concluded, saying it was beyond its responsibility to analyze American ''political processes'' or public opinion.   The intelligence agencies also concluded ''with high confidence'' that Russia's main military intelligence unit, the G.R.U., created a ''persona'' called Guccifer 2.0 and a website, DCLeaks.com, to release the emails of the Democratic National Committee and of the chairman of the Clinton campaign, John D. Podesta.   When those disclosures received what was seen as insufficient attention, the report said, the G.R.U. ''relayed material it acquired from the D.N.C. and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.'' The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has denied that Russia was the source of the emails it published.   The role of RT -- the Russian English-language news organization that American intelligence says is a Kremlin propaganda operation -- in the Kremlin's effort to influence the election is covered in far more detail by the report than any other aspect of the Russian campaign. An annex in the report on RT, which was first written in 2012 but not previously made public, takes up eight pages of the report's 14-page main section.   The report's unequivocal assessment of RT presents an awkward development for Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who is Mr. Trump's choice to serve as national security adviser. Mr. Flynn has appeared repeatedly on RT's news programs and in December 2015 was paid by the network to give a speech in Russia and attend its lavish anniversary party, where he sat at the elbow of Mr. Putin. Mr. Flynn has since defended his speech, insisting that RT is no different from CNN or MSNBC.   The report also stated that Russia collected data ''on some Republican-affiliated targets,'' but did not disclose the contents of whatever it harvested.   Intelligence officials who prepared the classified report have concluded that British intelligence was among the first to raise an alarm that Moscow hacked into the Democratic National Committee's computer servers, and alerted their American counterparts, according to two people familiar with the conclusions.   The British role, which has been closely held, is a critical part of the timeline because it suggests that some of the first tipoffs, in fall 2015, came from voice intercepts, computer traffic or informants outside the United States, as emails and other data from the Democratic National Committee flowed out of the country.   The conclusions in the report were described on Thursday to President Obama and on Friday to Mr. Trump by James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; John O. Brennan, the director of the C.I.A.; Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency; and James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I.   The key to the public report's assessment is that Russia's motives ''evolved over the course of the campaign.'' When it appeared that Mrs. Clinton was more likely to win, it concluded, the Russian effort focused ''on undermining her future presidency,'' with pro-Kremlin bloggers preparing a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #DemocracyRIP. It noted that Mr. Putin had a particular animus for Mrs. Clinton because he believed she had incited protests against him in 2011.   Yet the attacks, the report said, began long before anyone could have known that Mr. Trump, considered a dark horse, would win the Republican nomination. It said the attacks began as early as July 2015, when Russian intelligence operatives first gained access to the Democratic National Committee's networks. Russia maintained that access for 11 months, until ''at least June 2016,'' the report concludes, leaving open the possibility that Russian cyberattackers may have had access even after the firm CrowdStrike believed that it had kicked them off the networks.

Code Writer in Ukraine Could Blow Whistle on Russian Hacking,"KIEV, Ukraine -- The hacker, known only by his online alias ''Profexer,'' kept a low profile. He wrote computer code alone in an apartment and quietly sold his handiwork on the anonymous portion of the internet known as the dark web. Last winter, he suddenly went dark entirely. Profexer's posts, already accessible only to a small band of fellow hackers and cybercriminals looking for software tips, blinked out in January -- just days after American intelligence agencies publicly identified a program he had written as one tool used in Russian hacking in the United States. American intelligence agencies have determined Russian hackers were behind the electronic break-in of the Democratic National Committee.    But while Profexer's online persona vanished, a flesh-and-blood person has emerged: a fearful man who the Ukrainian police said turned himself in early this year, and has now become a witness for the F.B.I.    ''I don't know what will happen,'' he wrote in one of his last messages posted on a restricted-access website before going to the police. ''It won't be pleasant. But I'm still alive.''   It is the first known instance of a living witness emerging from the arid mass of technical detail that has so far shaped the investigation into the election hacking and the heated debate it has stirred. The Ukrainian police declined to divulge the man's name or other details, other than that he is living in Ukraine and has not been arrested.   There is no evidence that Profexer worked, at least knowingly, for Russia's intelligence services, but his malware apparently did.   That a hacking operation that Washington is convinced was orchestrated by Moscow would obtain malware from a source in Ukraine -- perhaps the Kremlin's most bitter enemy -- sheds considerable light on the Russian security services' modus operandi in what Western intelligence agencies say is their clandestine cyberwar against the United States and Europe.   It does not suggest a compact team of government employees who write all their own code and carry out attacks during office hours in Moscow or St. Petersburg, but rather a far looser enterprise that draws on talent and hacking tools wherever they can be found.   Also emerging from Ukraine is a sharper picture of what the United States believes is a Russian government hacking group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 28 or Fancy Bear. It is this group, which American intelligence agencies believe is operated by Russian military intelligence, that has been blamed, along with a second Russian outfit known as Cozy Bear, for the D.N.C. intrusion.   Rather than training, arming and deploying hackers to carry out a specific mission like just another military unit, Fancy Bear and its twin Cozy Bear have operated more as centers for organization and financing; much of the hard work like coding is outsourced to private and often crime-tainted vendors.    Russia's Testing Ground   In more than a decade of tracking suspected Russian-directed cyberattacks against a host of targets in the West and in former Soviet territories -- NATO, electrical grids, research groups, journalists critical of Russia and political parties, to name a few -- security services around the world have identified only a handful of people who are directly involved in either carrying out such attacks or providing the cyberweapons that were used.   This absence of reliable witnesses has left ample room for President Trump and others to raise doubts about whether Russia really was involved in the D.N.C. hack.   ''There is not now and never has been a single piece of technical evidence produced that connects the malware used in the D.N.C. attack to the G.R.U., F.S.B. or any agency of the Russian government,'' said Jeffrey Carr, the author of a book on cyberwarfare. The G.R.U. is Russia's military intelligence agency, and the F.S.B. its federal security service.   United States intelligence agencies, however, have been unequivocal in pointing a finger at Russia.   Seeking a path out of this fog, cybersecurity researchers and Western law enforcement officers have turned to Ukraine, a country that Russia has used for years as a laboratory for a range of politicized operations that later cropped up elsewhere, including electoral hacking in the United States.   In several instances, certain types of computer intrusions, like the use of malware to knock out crucial infrastructure or to pilfer email messages later released to tilt public opinion, occurred in Ukraine first. Only later were the same techniques used in Western Europe and the United States.   So, not surprisingly, those studying cyberwar in Ukraine are now turning up clues in the investigation of the D.N.C. break-in and related hacking, including the discovery of a rare witness.   Security experts were initially left scratching their heads when the Department of Homeland Security on Dec. 29 released technical evidence of Russian hacking that seemed to point not to Russia, but rather to Ukraine.   In this initial report, the department released only one sample of malware said to be an indicator of Russian state-sponsored hacking, though outside experts said a variety of malicious programs were used in Russian electoral hacking.   The sample pointed to a malware program, called the P.A.S. web shell, a hacking tool advertised on Russian-language dark web forums and used by cybercriminals throughout the former Soviet Union. The author, Profexer, is a well-regarded technical expert among hackers, spoken about with awe and respect in Kiev.   He had made it available to download, free, from a website that asked only for donations, ranging from $3 to $250. The real money was made by selling customized versions and by guiding his hacker clients in its effective use. It remains unclear how extensively he interacted with the Russian hacking team.   After the Department of Homeland Security identified his creation, he quickly shut down his website and posted on a closed forum for hackers, called Exploit, that ''I'm not interested in excessive attention to me personally.''   Soon, a hint of panic appeared, and he posted a note saying that, six days on, he was still alive.   Another hacker, with the nickname Zloi Santa, or Bad Santa, suggested the Americans would certainly find him, and place him under arrest, perhaps during a layover at an airport.   ''It could be, or it could not be, it depends only on politics,'' Profexer responded. ''If U.S. law enforcement wants to take me down, they will not wait for me in some country's airport. Relations between our countries are so tight I would be arrested in my kitchen, at the first request.''   In fact, Serhiy Demediuk, chief of the Ukrainian Cyber Police, said in an interview that Profexer went to the authorities himself. As the cooperation began, Profexer went dark on hacker forums. He last posted online on Jan. 9. Mr. Demediuk said he had made the witness available to the F.B.I., which has posted a full-time cybersecurity expert in Kiev as one of four bureau agents stationed at the United States Embassy there. The F.B.I. declined to comment.   Profexer was not arrested because his activities fell in a legal gray zone, as an author but not a user of malware, the Ukrainian police say. But he did know the users, at least by their online handles. ''He told us he didn't create it to be used in the way it was,'' Mr. Demediuk said.   A member of Ukraine's Parliament with close ties to the security services, Anton Gerashchenko, said that the interaction was online or by phone and that the Ukrainian programmer had been paid to write customized malware without knowing its purpose, only later learning it was used in Russian hacking.   Mr. Gerashchenko described the author only in broad strokes, to protect his safety, as a young man from a provincial Ukrainian city. He confirmed that the author turned himself in to the police and was cooperating as a witness in the D.N.C. investigation. ''He was a freelancer and now he is a valuable witness,'' Mr. Gerashchenko said.   It is not clear whether the specific malware the programmer created was used to hack the D.N.C. servers, but it was identified in other Russian hacking efforts in the United States.   A Bear's Lair   While it is not known what Profexer has told Ukrainian investigators and the F.B.I. about Russia's hacking efforts, evidence emanating from Ukraine has again provided some of the clearest pictures yet about Fancy Bear, or Advanced Persistent Threat 28, which is run by the G.R.U.   Fancy Bear has been identified mostly by what it does, not by who does it. One of its recurring features has been the theft of emails and its close collaboration with the Russian state news media.   Tracking the bear to its lair, however, has so far proved impossible, not least because many experts believe that no such single place exists.   Even for a sophisticated tech company like Microsoft, singling out individuals in the digital miasma has proved just about impossible. To curtail the damage to clients' operating systems, the company filed a complaint against Fancy Bear last year with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia but found itself boxing with shadows.   As Microsoft lawyers reported to the court, ''because defendants used fake contact information, anonymous Bitcoin and prepaid credit cards and false identities, and sophisticated technical means to conceal their identities, when setting up and using the relevant internet domains, defendants' true identities remain unknown.''   Nevertheless, Ukrainian officials, though wary of upsetting the Trump administration, have been quietly cooperating with American investigators to try to figure out who stands behind all the disguises.   Included in this sharing of information were copies of the server hard drives of Ukraine's Central Election Commission, which were targeted during a presidential election in May 2014. That the F.B.I. had obtained evidence of this earlier, Russian-linked electoral hack has not been previously reported.   Traces of the same malicious code, this time a program called Sofacy, were seen in the 2014 attack in Ukraine and later in the D.N.C. intrusion in the United States.   Intriguingly, in the cyberattack during the Ukrainian election, what appears to have been a bungle by Channel 1, a Russian state television station, inadvertently implicated the government authorities in Moscow.   Hackers had loaded onto a Ukrainian election commission server a graphic mimicking the page for displaying results. This phony page showed a shocker of an outcome: an election win for a fiercely anti-Russian, ultraright candidate, Dmytro Yarosh. Mr. Yarosh in reality received less than 1 percent of the vote.   The false result would have played into a Russian propaganda narrative that Ukraine today is ruled by hard-right, even fascist, figures.   The fake image was programmed to display when polls closed, at 8 p.m., but a Ukrainian cybersecurity company, InfoSafe, discovered it just minutes earlier and unplugged the server.   State television in Russia nevertheless reported that Mr. Yarosh had won and broadcast the fake graphic, citing the election commission's website, even though the image had never appeared there. The hacker had clearly provided Channel 1 with the same image in advance, but the reporters had failed to check that the hack actually worked.   ''For me, this is an obvious link between the hackers and Russian officials,'' said Victor Zhora, director of InfoSafe, the cybersecurity company that first found the fake graphic.   A Ukrainian government researcher who studied the hack, Nikolai Koval, published his findings in a 2015 book, ''Cyberwar in Perspective,'' and identified the Sofacy malware on the server.   The mirror of the hard drive went to the F.B.I., which had this forensic sample when the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike identified the same malware two years later, on the D.N.C. servers.   ''It was the first strike,'' Mr. Zhora said of the earlier hack of Ukraine's electoral computers. Ukraine's Cyber Police have also provided the F.B.I. with copies of server hard drives showing the possible origins of some phishing emails targeting the Democratic Party during the election.   In 2016, two years after the election hack in Ukraine, hackers using some of the same techniques plundered the email system of the World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, which had accused Russian athletes of systematic drug use.   That raid, too, seems to have been closely coordinated with Russian state television, which began airing well-prepared reports about WADA's hacked emails just minutes after they were made public. The emails appeared on a website that announced that WADA had been hacked by a group calling itself the ''Fancy Bears' Hack Team.''   It was the first time Fancy Bear had broken cover.   Fancy Bear remains extraordinarily elusive, however. To throw investigators off its scent, the group has undergone various makeovers, restocking its arsenal of malware and sometimes hiding under different guises. One of its alter egos, cyberexperts believe, is Cyber Berkut, an outfit supposedly set up in Ukraine by supporters of the country's pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was ousted in 2014.   After lying dormant for many months, Cyber Berkut jumped back into action this summer just as multiple investigations in Washington into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow shifted into high gear. Cyber Berkut released stolen emails that it and Russian state news media said had exposed the real story: Hillary Clinton had colluded with Ukraine.     "
Tech Roundup: Will Robots Replace Lawyers?,"Robots have worked in factories for years. They're starting to do the driving for you. Now some people believe the next advance by artificial intelligence into the workplace will involve the legal profession.  But advancing into the workplace is not the same as replacing the people who work there. As Steve Lohr writes, big law firms are both investing in and testing artificial intelligence to do tasks like document searches and even some contract writing.    Recent research concluded that ''putting all new legal technology in place immediately would result in an estimated 13 percent decline in lawyers' hours.'' A more realistic adoption rate would cut hours worked by lawyers by 2.5 percent annually over five years.   Could that slow down hiring? Absolutely. But artificial intelligence has a way to go before it has an effect similar to the transformation that basic digitization -- spreadsheets, word processing software, online access to historical documents -- brought to the legal community's work force.   More tech news:   Two more executive join the exodus at Uber. Jeff Jones, Uber's president of ride sharing, has left the company after just six months, and Brian McClendon, vice president of maps and business platform at the company, also plans to leave, the company said.   The Silicon Valley venture capitalist who is helping Uber get back on track. Bill Gurley is a rare figure in Silicon Valley, vocally chiding some of the biggest start-up stars to show some discipline. Now he is involved in helping the ride-sharing company move past its difficulties.   Data on one billion Yahoo user accounts appears to be for sale. After federal prosecutors unsealed indictments this week against four men they say were responsible for a data breach that affected 500 million user accounts, data on one billion accounts -- stolen in another attack on the company a year earlier -- appeared to remain available on underground hacker forums.

Identity Theft,"Amanda Hess is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times. She last wrote a First Words column about how ''trolls'' stole Washington. In the escalating rhetoric of public shaming, being embarrassed online is tantamount to being wiped from the face of the earth. Whenever a late-night host upbraids a public figure in a monologue or a pundit bests another in a Twitter fight, onlookers crowd around to declare the loser DESTROYED! or EVISCERATED! or ETHERED! or ANNIHILATED! But alongside these symbols of destruction has risen another, more apt metaphor for the dynamics of the modern media power play. In this one, the defeated party wasn't killed, but possessed: They got OWNED. When the white nationalist Richard Spencer approvingly posted a song from ''Cabaret'' on Twitter in March, former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander swooped in to say: ''Hey, buddy, that song you love was written by my uncle. He's been married to my other uncle for 40 years. And he's a Jew.'' A Twitter bystander waded into Spencer's mentions and observed: ''You get publicly owned with astonishing frequency, it's really wonderful.''     Ownage can be politically urgent or purely irreverent. When the Slate editor Gabriel Roth complained about Merriam-Webster Dictionary's overly laid-back attitude toward changes in usage -- ''I feel like @MerriamWebster is turning into the 'chill' parent who lets your friends come over and get high,'' he wrote on Twitter -- the account replied: ''No one cares how you feel.'' Dozens piled on to rub it in: ''You got owned by the dictionary.'' On the internet, where rhetorical victories are so fleeting, the phrase is oddly satisfying: It's a passing but dramatic staking of argumentative ground.   ''Owned'' is borrowed from hacker slang. If you got owned, that meant some hacker jimmied the lock on a virtual back door, snooped around your property and rifled through your stuff. The word speaks of a literal possession: annexing another person's virtual space and stealing private information. But ''you got owned'' also animates a simple theft with a violent spark. Owning someone isn't just about taking his things; it's about diminishing him as a person. With enough specialized technical knowledge, you can actually seize control of another human being, or at least the person's virtual presence.   Among hackers, ownage often works as a form of community discipline. In the early aughts, underground online zines like Zero for Owned -- ZF0 for short -- emerged as sites for hackers to detail how they broke into the systems of prominent security professionals and fellow hackers to shame them for overstating their skills. ''We believe actions speak louder than words,'' the first issue of Zero for Owned announced. ''While you were talking trash, we were sifting through your files, reading your conversations, owning more boxes'' -- computers -- ''on your networks, and you had no idea.'' The zines spread around their targets' website code and personal communications as punishment. By finding gaps in the technological skill of famous hackers, the creators of these zines justified the release of the private information the hackers had failed to protect.   Now, as information security has become increasingly central to both global politics and personal relationships, ''owned'' has migrated from the online underground to the mainstream. There has never been a stronger relationship between who we are perceived to be and what kind of information we have. Recent concerns over ''filter bubbles,'' ''fake news'' and political memes churned out by Russian trolls lay bare the fact that our beliefs are controlled by the data we consume. Information silos make us vulnerable to being owned not only because of our ignorance -- the things we don't know -- but also because of how little control we have over the things we do know. We're constantly open to exposure. The hacking and release of emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, and from the Democratic National Committee didn't reveal any bombshells, but they succeeded in scandalizing through the simple act of making the private public.   Now President Trump tweets conspiratorially about ''leaks'' and ''wiretapping,'' fixated on the idea that his political rivals have acquired or released his secrets -- and obsessed with the suggestion that he is somehow an illegitimate president. The threat of getting owned -- being revealed as oblivious, uninformed or incompetent -- works like a virtual Panopticon to keep people in a state of anxiety, keen to guard their own insecurities as they poke at other people's flaws.   For thinkers throughout history, owning things was seen not just as useful and pleasant, but also as a source of human virtue. Aristotle argued that ''the meaner sort of workman,'' by virtue of his lack of possessions, was ''too degraded'' to participate in politics and contribute to society. Hegel thought that owning things was a way for people to externalize their personal freedom. ''It is in possession first of all that the person becomes rational,'' he wrote in ''Philosophy of Right.'' And of course there is the obvious strangeness in talking about people ''owning'' one another online in a nation where, for a very long time, people did own other people -- and where many of them argued that this was an ennobling endeavor for everyone involved. The antebellum statesman John Calhoun defended owning slaves as a ''positive good.''   More recently, our celebration of ownership has pointed inward. We speak approvingly of ''coming into one's own'' or ''being one's own person.'' To be ''self-possessed'' is to be confident and poised. Ownage just turns that self-confidence back outward: Now we wield our superior knowledge and skills over our rivals.   In the hacking context, owning someone is all about a display of superior technological abilities. When the word migrated from hacking to gaming, ''owned'' became a mantra for those who had mastered the game play or bested opponents. Now it extends to rhetorical force -- a well-timed and withering joke or an irrefutable debate line. After the ''Saturday Night Live'' comedian Leslie Jones was hacked -- her private photographs were stolen and spread across the web -- Complex magazine's Daniel Barna said that she ''owned her hackers'' in an ''S.N.L.'' monologue.   Ownage radiates power. ''Owned'' and its derivative, ''pwned'' (pronounced any number of ways, but mostly ''poned''), are bits of leetspeak -- ''leet'' as in ''elite.'' If pidgin languages create a simplified slang to foster cross-cultural communication, leetspeak deliberately complicates the root language, replacing letters with numbers and symbols and swapping characters. It's an ideal code for people who believe their mastery of the internet has raised them to a higher plane of existence. ''Pwnage'' creates an in-group and an out-group, and furthers the fetishization of specialized knowledge down to the level of casual conversation.   The mainstreaming of ''owned'' has always come with a bit of a wink, an acknowledgment that those most eager to lord their superior knowledge over others often have the biggest blind spots. That was the dynamic that fueled the hacker zines, in which the owners got owned. As the usage of ''owned'' spread, it also was mixed with stereotypes of hackers and gamers as being socially awkward. That underlying paradox of the gamer persona fueled the long-running web series ''Pure Pwnage,'' which followed a kid named Jeremy who was highly skilled at video games but a failure at real life. Now ownage communicates dominance, but it also belies an underlying impotence.   All of this has set the stage for ownage's latest twist: the rise of the self-own. If an own exposes another person's ignorance, a self-own reveals your own obliviousness. During the campaign, Bobby Jindal tried to insult President Trump on Twitter but ended up suggesting that only fools would donate to Jindal's campaign: ''We have met. You wrote a check. A fool & his money are soon parted. A fool & his dad's money are parted sooner.'' Jindal owned himself. Recently Trump's White House communications team circulated a flattering Washington Post article about how great the president's budget was -- headlined ''Trump's Budget Makes Perfect Sense and Will Fix America, and I Will Tell You Why'' -- except the article was satirical. That was a presidential self-own.   The most successful ownage finds hubristic targets, people who think they know more than they do. But ownage is itself a hubristic act -- it turns knowledge into a tool for exploiting another person's lack thereof. Owning someone sets you up to be owned yourself, sometimes in the same breath. The self-own -- and a related concept, ''You played yourself,'' the refrain of the motivational Snapchat user DJ Khaled -- is a double entendre. In the self-own, you let yourself down by being so nakedly yourself. You fail, in the end, by being you.

Intelligence Officials Warn Of Continued Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON -- On the same day that President Trump went on Twitter to renew his claim that the focus on Russian hacking was ''a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election,'' his two top intelligence officials told the Senate on Thursday that Russian cyberactivities were the foremost threat facing the United States and were likely to grow only more severe. The officials delivered the warning as the nation's intelligence agencies released their annual worldwide threat assessment, which described the Kremlin's ''aggressive cyberposture,'' evidenced by ''Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. election.''     Dan Coats, Mr. Trump's director of national intelligence, repeated and endorsed, almost word for word, the Obama administration's conclusion that ''only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized the 2016 U.S. election-focused data thefts and disclosures, based on the scope and sensitivity of the targets.''   That conclusion is widely shared among Mr. Trump's top national security officials. The only prominent dissenter appears to be the president himself, who has continued to insist that there is no conclusive evidence pinning the cyberactivity on the Russians, though he said in an interview with NBC News, ''If Russia did anything, I want to know that.''   Only a few hours after the officials' testimony, the White House said the dismissal on Tuesday of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, should help the bureau's investigation of the Russian hacking come to a speedy conclusion. The intelligence officials, by contrast, said the inquiries into the matter must delve deeply into the question of how to prevent future attacks.   Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Russians and others would try to meddle again in future elections and added, ''I hope we learn from it as well and will be able to more effectively defeat it.''   Also on Thursday, Mr. Trump signed a long-delayed executive order on cyberissues, one that places more responsibility on cabinet officials to secure their agencies' systems but also sets up a series of rapid-fire reviews of the federal efforts. Among them is a study of how to deter cyberattacks -- an issue that has confounded the Pentagon, the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security, among others, and was the focus of extensive, if inconclusive, efforts by the Obama administration.   At the heart of the problem, as Russia's hacking showed, is that few of the techniques used to deter either nuclear or conventional armed attacks work in cyberspace, where both the identity and the location of the attacker are often hidden for long periods of time. President Barack Obama used a variety of methods to respond to attacks -- indictments of Chinese and Iranian hackers, counterattacks on North Korea, the expulsion of diplomats and relatively mild economic sanctions against Russia -- but none proved especially effective.   The new order ''creates a certain sense of urgency,'' said Stevan Bunnell, a former general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security. But though the executive order -- which Mr. Trump had planned to issue shortly after taking office -- was drafted and redrafted for months, ''there is nothing much new here,'' Mr. Bunnell concluded.   Before taking office, Mr. Trump talked about shifting more of the nation's cyberdefenses to the Pentagon. But many industry officials, and government officials with long experience trying to win cooperation from Silicon Valley companies, warned that Mr. Trump risked over-militarizing the American response. The revised order limits the military's role to national security systems.   A decade ago, cyberthreats did not even make the annual list of top concerns the intelligence agencies draw up for Congress. But those threats have now been at the top of the list for several years, ahead of terrorism and nuclear proliferation. While many expected that to change under the Trump administration, given the president's frequent talk about a border wall and ''radical Islamic terrorism,'' the intelligence agencies stuck to their assessments.   ''The intelligence community has never wavered on this,'' said Rajesh De, a former general counsel at the National Security Agency. Its warnings on Russia, he said, ''are clear, but they are at variance with the politician in chief.''   The declassified version of the threat assessment is used largely to set broad strategy and priorities. But it came after a year in which the intelligence agencies were taken by surprise by Russia and reacted slowly to evidence of hacking attacks against the Democratic National Committee and a series of other prominent targets.   ''The Russians have upped their game using social media and other opportunities in ways that we haven't seen before,'' Mr. Coats said. ''So it's a great threat to our democratic process, and our job here is to provide the best intelligence we can to the policy makers as they develop a strategy in terms of how to best reflect a response.''   But that strategic necessity has run headlong into Mr. Trump's immediate tactical necessity: to make the long, complex tale of the Russian hacking of the election, and any possible ties to his associates, go away.   That was evident in Mr. Trump's Twitter feed on Thursday. An hour after he sent out an image of himself signing the executive order on cybersecurity, he wrote that ''Russia must be laughing up their sleeves'' watching the United States pursue the hacking investigation.

"Victims of Data Breaches Talk of Initial Terror, And Then of Vigilance","One man said his name had been used to set up a fraudulent company that processed payments made with stolen credit cards. A woman said her bank had told her she was being sought by a collections agency -- her Social Security number had been used to open a wireless account that was never paid off. In the wake of the disclosure on Thursday by Equifax that hackers had compromised its collection of private information, potentially affecting 143 million Americans, The New York Times asked readers to tell their own tales of being hacked. Some previous victims of data breaches have also taken to Twitter.     David Anderson said his personal information had been stolen four times in four years.   During the 2013 holiday season, hackers gained access to personal and financial details for as many as 110 million Target customers, including Mr. Anderson. The next year, a breach at the University of Maryland, where Mr. Anderson earned his doctorate, affected 309,000 people.   In 2015, an intrusion into computer systems for the government's Office of Personnel Management affected 21.5 million people. Mr. Anderson, a business school professor in New York, was one of them.   And then there was the breach at Equifax, one of the country's three major credit monitoring agencies. Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers and other sensitive data for 143 million Americans were in the mix, the company said.   But Mr. Anderson was lucky: The thieves have not used his information so far.   Many people can't say the same. The consequences of cyberattacks can be devastating and take years to untangle, at great financial and personal cost. Last year, 15.4 million American victims of identity theft lost $16 billion, an increase in both victims and losses from the previous year, according to Javelin Strategy & Research.   But hackings often go unnoticed -- at first.   One man said the thieves had so ruined his credit, he was unable to secure a needed mortgage refinance.   Janis Barbour said her Social Security number was used to fraudulently file taxes in Ohio. She and her husband live in Berkeley, Calif.   They learned of the theft only when the Internal Revenue Service confronted them for not declaring a tax refund as income. And that was just one problem.   Her credit card details were stolen in data breaches at Target and Home Depot, she said. A digital attack at her health insurance provider made more private information vulnerable.   She said she had spent nine months trying to get the I.R.S. to agree that her identity was stolen. She had to report the intrusion to local police, then file an affidavit, then contact the credit bureaus and then the Ohio government.   Ms. Barbour, a retired marketing researcher, said she has never had a physical credit card or Social Security card stolen. Several years ago, she and her husband locked their credit reports from activity from outside parties.   Then on Friday, she learned she and her husband were included in the Equifax breach. ''It feels like there's nothing you can really do to protect yourself,'' she said.   In the first half of 2017, there were a record 791 data breaches in the United States, up 29 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. From Jan. 1, 2005, to Sept. 5 of this year, more than 907 million records were exposed in nearly 8,000 attacks.   As a result, consumers like Kate Fairweather say they feel that they cannot prevent their information from leaking into the shadows of the internet.   ''I thought, 'Well, here we go again','' said Ms. Fairweather, an employee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who found out this week that the Equifax attack made her data vulnerable two years after it was stolen in the Office of Personnel Management hacking.   Michael Harwood, an engineering manager in Melbourne, Fla., said his information was stolen two years ago.   ''Initially, it's really terrifying, especially having your Social Security number taken,'' said Mr. Harwood, who noticed a mysterious attempt to transfer $1,000 from his bank account. ''You're worried about the tremendous implications this could have and the possibility of it going on for years.''   He said he had managed to trace the transaction through his PayPal account to his eBay profile, where he discovered an intrusion that laid bare a trove of personal information.   He spent the next month trying to repair the breach. He went to the local police station, set up a program to screen for suspicious activity stemming from his Social Security number and financial data, changed his eBay password and created a new bank account.   That meant a long wait for new credit and debt cards, a temporary freeze of his assets and a hold on withdrawals and transfers while the bank handled the move.   ''That was a major pain,'' Mr. Harwood said, adding that his original account and routing numbers had been linked to a slew of automated payments and shopping sites, including Amazon and travel booking sites. ''It ends up being fairly far-reaching and inconvenient -- you're still making discoveries months later that there's another account you have to correct.''   He said he now watched his accounts closely and signed up for services from LifeLock, an identity theft protection company. He also counts his blessings.   ''It could've been much worse.''     "
Prosecutors Open Criminal Investigation Into Sweeping Equifax Data Breach,"Federal authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the massive data breach at Equifax, which potentially exposed the personal information of up to 143 million Americans, including their Social Security and driver's license numbers.  United States Attorney John A. Horn, the federal prosecutor in Atlanta, said in a statement that his office was working with the F.B.I. to investigate the cyberattack.    While the investigation is focused on the data breach, actions taken by Equifax executives also could come under scrutiny. In the days after the breach was discovered -- but before it was publicly disclosed -- three Equifax executives, including its chief financial officer, John W. Gamble Jr., sold $1.8 million in company shares. Since the breach became public, Equifax's shares have tumbled about 35 percent.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission and at least 34 state attorneys general have opened inquiries into the attack. Last Monday, leaders of the of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter to Equifax seeking information about the timeline of the incident and about the executives who had sold shares. The letter asked that Equifax respond no later than Sept. 28.   On Oct. 3, Equifax's chief executive, Richard F. Smith, will be questioned by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.   Another congressional panel, the House Financial Services Committee, said that it will hold a hearing of its own, according to a statement by the committee's chairman, Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas. A spokesman said a date had not yet been set, but Mr. Smith said in a letter last week that the company would cooperate with the committee.   Earlier on Monday, the New York Department of Financial Services urged financial institutions regulated by the state to immediately take precautions to protect consumers. That includes installing security patches on their systems and ensuring that fraud- and identity-theft-prevention programs were in place, particularly when opening new credit card accounts and issuing new loans. It also asked institutions to take extra care verifying information before making lending decisions.   ''The scope and scale of this cyberattack is unprecedented,'' Maria T. Vullo, the department superintendent, said in a statement. She said the department was providing guidelines ''to ensure that this incident receives the highest level of attention and vigilance at New York's regulated institutions.''     "
What Has Facebook Learned Since the 2016 Election?,"Nearly a year after Election Day, Facebook's role in our modern political infrastructure is finally coming into focus. We now know, for example, that Russian-linked Facebook ads reached roughly 10 million Americans during the presidential election season, and that Russian government actors posed as Americans on Facebook to push divisive social issues like gun control, gay rights and the Black Lives Matter movement. We also know, thanks to a recent interview with Brad Parscale, President Trump's digital campaign director, that the Trump campaign considered Facebook's advertising microtargeting tools essential to its victory.    But there is much more to know. Facebook has addressed some election-related questions, and may share more next month when its executives testify in front of the House and Senate intelligence committees. These investigations may focus solely on Russian interference, but they could also produce valuable information about how Facebook operates as a company, how it views its role on the political stage, and how it plans to safeguard its platform from malicious activity in the future.    The conversation about Facebook would benefit from more facts, and less speculation. So this week, I sent a list of some of my unanswered questions to Facebook. Two representatives -- Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief security officer, and Joe Osborne, a company spokesman -- responded to several questions in some detail. The company declined to answer several other questions, but I include those here as well, in hopes that they might one day be answered.   Below are my questions, followed by Facebook's responses, where applicable.   1. In an April 2017 white paper, your security team disclosed an incident during the 2016 election in which ''malicious actors'' were discovered to be using fake Facebook accounts to promote links to stolen information. The paper did not name the actors, but it was later revealed that this referred to a coordinated campaign to promote emails that were stolen from Democratic National Committee officials by Russian hackers and published by WikiLeaks. It has also been reported that Facebook's legal and policy teams pressured the security team to exclude any mentions of Russia from their report. Why did they want to keep this information from becoming public?   Alex Stamos, chief security officer, Facebook:   In our April white paper, ''Information Operations and Facebook,'' we described the activity that we detected from a sophisticated threat actor that was spreading stolen information about specific political targets in the run-up to the U.S. election and using it to feed press stories that they could then amplify. We took steps to disrupt this activity and reported details to the relevant authorities.   In this white paper, we noted the challenge of attributing threat activity to foreign actors ourselves, but we specifically referenced the assessment of the U.S. government that this actor was tied to Russia's intelligence services. This was an accurate statement of what we knew about this particular actor at the time, and it appropriately relied on the U.S. intelligence community's public analysis.   We have been forthcoming at every opportunity about what we know about these information operations. In addition to our white paper, last month we disclosed advertising activity on our platform that we believe is linked to the Internet Research Agency, a different group from the one we described in April. We undertook this research on our own, and we named the group based on our best assessment because we weren't aware of a comparable public report from the government.   2. Related to the above question: In July 2016, WikiLeaks complained that Facebook was censoring links to a page on its website that hosted the hacked D.N.C. emails. Your chief security officer, Alex Stamos, replied to WikiLeaks (in a tweet that has since been deleted) saying that the issue had ''been fixed.'' Links to WikiLeaks were subsequently restored. Did Facebook's security team manually override a tool that flagged these fake accounts as suspicious? If so, who was responsible for the decision to restore access to WikiLeaks, despite having detected a suspicious campaign to promote its stolen documents? Did you notify law enforcement that your security team had intercepted a coordinated influence campaign?   Mr. Stamos: The temporary block of some WikiLeaks links by our automated spam-fighting systems had nothing to do with information operations. It was caused by WikiLeaks posting thousands of raw emails -- several of which contained links to malicious phishing and spam sites found in industrywide block lists. We removed the block after we determined that the WikiLeaks links themselves were not harmful.   3. You recently announced you were adding 1,000 human moderators to the team that reviews Facebook ads. How many human ad reviewers did Facebook employ in November 2016? And what percentage of political ads that ran on Facebook during the 2016 election cycle did they review?   Joe Osborne, Facebook spokesman: We don't usually share the sizes of specific teams at Facebook. Our teams review millions of ads around the world each week, and we use a mix of automated and manual processes. We're not sharing an exact break-out of the number of manually reviewed political ads.   4. Of the 1,000 human moderators you're hiring, how many will be based in the United States? Will you be hiring moderators to review ads in non-English languages? What kinds of pre-hire screening will you do to make sure that these moderators are not affiliated with foreign governments, extremist groups, or others looking to influence the American political process?   Mr. Osborne: We are still working through where the moderators will be based, but likely across regions including the U.S., Europe and Asia.   5. You recently told advertisers that new ad campaigns that involved ''politics, religion, ethnicity or social issues'' would be reviewed by humans before being approved. What guidelines will reviewers be given about which ads to allow and which to reject? Will these guidelines be made public?   6. Your advertising policies allow advertisers to opt out of appearing next to content that involves ''debatable social issues.'' Which social issues do you define as ''debatable,'' and how did you make that call? Is your definition of ''debatable social issues'' globally consistent, or does it vary by region?   7. In countries with regressive social policies, such as criminalizing homosexuality, do you allow the local authorities to determine which issues are considered debatable?   Mr. Osborne: No.   8. Last year, ProPublica found that Facebook advertisers could exclude certain ethnic groups from seeing advertisements about housing, employment and credit, in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws. In response, Facebook announced it would no longer allow ethnic group targeting for those ad categories. Did you consider extending the ban on ethnic group targeting to all ads, including political ads? Did you consider that political campaigns might use ethnic group targeting to suppress voter participation among certain ethnic groups? (Trump campaign officials claim to have used targeted Facebook ads to suppress African-American voters in the weeks leading up to the election.)   9. Did you, at any point leading up to the 2016 election, consider adding disclosures to political ads that made clear who was paying for those ads? If so, why did you decide not to include that feature?   10. You have said you are committed to protecting election integrity and supporting democratic ideals. However, there have been reports that you have built tools to censor speech in certain authoritarian countries, such as China, where you hope to be allowed to operate. How will you choose which elections and democratic processes to protect? When promoting democratic ideals conflicts with your corporate goals, which will you prioritize?   11. Mr. Trump's digital campaign director, Brad Parscale, has said that Facebook sent ''embeds'' to work inside the Trump campaign offices and help them use Facebook more efficiently. (You have responded that these offers are standard for political campaigns, and that you ''offered identical support to both the Trump and Clinton campaigns.'') What kinds of work did your employees do on behalf of the Trump campaign? Were they involved in writing or editing any of the campaign's Facebook posts? Were they given page roles or posting rights on any Trump campaign Facebook pages? Were they authorized to report any illegal or suspicious activity they found in the course of their work? If so, did they make any such reports?   12. Your advertiser website lists ''success stories'' of political campaigns that have used Facebook advertising to increase turnout and win elections. Knowing that Facebook could be used to influence election results, why did you not use a United States presidential election as an occasion to build the proper safeguards to make sure that your system was not gamed by foreign or malicious actors?

Equifax Grip Puts Squeeze On Its Rivals,"Twitter: @gmorgenson Like it or not, when you apply for a home mortgage or to refinance an existing loan, Equifax will be a part of the process. That's because, of the three major credit reporting agencies, only Equifax has a division, Equifax Mortgage Solutions, that supplies lenders with what is known as a merged credit report. These reports, which borrowers pay for, compile information provided by Equifax and the other two major credit reporting agencies, Experian and TransUnion.    As with much else about the credit-reporting industry, you don't have a choice about who provides your information. Mortgage lenders need to know your credit standing when they consider whether to give you a loan, and while other credit-reporting companies can provide a merged report, Equifax is a major go-to source for that information.   This is a very big business for Equifax. The mortgage solutions unit generated $142 million in operating revenue last year, up 15 percent from 2015. The unit accounted for 11.5 percent of Equifax's operating revenue last year.    Given that the company's lapses recently allowed hackers to steal personal information belonging to as many as 145.5 million consumers, Equifax's dominance in this arena is unfortunate.   Even more troubling is a deal between Freddie Mac, the huge mortgage-finance company, and Equifax that gave the troubled credit reporting agency an even tighter grip on the business of providing credit information.   Here's the background. Both Freddie Mac and the other government-sponsored mortgage finance company, Fannie Mae, have automated underwriting systems that are meant to make their loan guarantee or purchasing processes work smoothly and quickly. Mortgage lenders rely on them heavily.   A borrower's credit standing is a crucial piece of the information that flows into these systems. While Equifax and the other big credit-reporting agencies dominate, a group of about 40 other firms also provide lenders with credit information. In addition to supplying merged credit reports as Equifax does, these firms often provide more detailed information, including verification of a borrower's employment, and past payments to utilities, phone companies and landlords.   That these independent companies can still operate in a world that Equifax dominates may be an indication that they provide superior customer service such as quickly correcting errors or outdated information in a report. Equifax can supply the same information, but its customer service is not so stellar. The internet abounds with consumer complaints about the company, and since the data breach, many consumers have said they have been unable to reach the company.   That is what comes of having little or no competition. Which is why it is troubling that Freddie Mac has decided to allow Equifax to ban dozens of rival credit-reporting companies from one part of its automated system.   Freddie Mac recently developed Loan Quality Advisor, a new part of that system. It was, according to the company's website, a ''risk and eligibility assessment tool that evaluates loan data to help lenders determine if a loan is eligible for sale to Freddie Mac.''   Naturally, a borrower's credit history goes into this system. But Freddie Mac assigned gatekeeper status to Equifax, essentially allowing it to bar an array of competing firms from providing credit information during the process.   This change hurts competitors by ensuring that what could be their business goes to Equifax instead. But it may also harm certain borrowers. Because of the more efficient services the other firms often provide, preventing them from participating could make it more difficult for borrowers with errors on their credit histories to correct them in time to secure a mortgage.   (Fannie Mae has taken a different approach with its automated loan-underwriting system. Its structure is more open, allowing independent credit-information providers to participate at multiple levels)   Interestingly, an internal Freddie Mac email indicates that Equifax drove the decision to keep independent companies, known as technical affiliates, out of the system.   ''Equifax chose not to make adjustments to be able to accommodate the T.A.s,'' wrote an official in Freddie Mac's Vendor Technology Integration unit. Because Equifax ''chose not to add functionality to support,'' she added, ''we were unable to support as a result.''   I asked Equifax why it was keeping so many competitors, most of them smaller, off the Freddie Mac system. Wyatt Jefferies, a spokesman, did not respond directly, saying only that Equifax ''operated within existing Fair Credit Reporting Act guidelines'' with all the independent companies.   In light of the recent data breach at Equifax and deep consumer unease about the company's practices, I thought Freddie Mac might be rethinking its granting Equifax what amounts to most favored nation status.   It is not. Chad Wandler, a Freddie Mac spokesman, said that having access to a broad network of credit-report providers ''has not been cited as a priority for those customers who use our quality control tools like Loan Quality Advisor.'' He added, ''We will continue to listen to our customers to provide the functionality they need.''   Naturally, this does not sit well with independent credit-reporting companies.   ''What we're talking about here is to provide the consumer with a touch point of service that is different than what you get from the bureaus,'' said Terry Clemans, executive director of the National Consumer Reporting Association, an organization of credit-reporting agencies, employment-screening services and tenant-screening companies. ''But Equifax has elected to not let these companies compete, and Freddie Mac has put them in that position to allow it.''   Given that Freddie Mac is owned by taxpayers, lawmakers may be interested in its dealings with Equifax. In the past week, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, asked the Treasury Department to prohibit Equifax from eligibility for government contracts, saying the company did not deserve to earn taxpayer money. (On Thursday, the Internal Revenue Service, a unit of the Treasury, said it had suspended a $7.2 million contract it awarded to Equifax last month.)   Amid all this, it is noteworthy that Equifax imposes higher costs than competitors for some of its credit-reporting services. In an Equifax email in September 2016 about a price increase at the company, an employee said that it charged its competitors, who must buy the information, two to three times the combined costs charged by Experian and TransUnion.   Mr. Jefferies, the Equifax spokesman, declined to comment on the agency's pricing. But he said in a statement that the company's price adjustments ''reflect investments we are making to ensure we are delivering market-leading innovation and technology to customers.''   Unlike its competitors, Equifax also charges more for a type of credit report used by housing counselors who work with troubled consumers to get their finances back on track.   There are two types of credit reports -- a ''hard pull'' and a ''soft pull.'' A hard pull is requested by a lender looking to extend credit to a consumer. A soft pull, by contrast, is used by loan counselors to get a fix on a consumer's credit standing.   Most credit-reporting companies charge the same for both types of reports. Not Equifax. It charges twice as much for a soft pull as it does for a hard pull, housing counselors said.   ''The role of housing counseling and assisting people getting and maintaining credit is really crucial,'' said Bruce Dorpalen, executive director of the National Housing Resource Center in Philadelphia, an advocacy organization for nonprofit housing counselors. ''To penalize them by charging extra for a credit report is disadvantaging people when they need help the most.''   Mr. Jefferies of Equifax declined to comment on this practice.   Let's have a show of hands out there. How many think Equifax should have even more control and sway in the credit reporting industry than it already has?   Noted.     "
"MetroCard Replacement Will Be Safe, Officials Say","The MetroCard has had its downsides -- ''Please swipe again'' are three words that are the curse of just about every New York City subway rider. More significantly, the wallet-size card has become outdated in a high-tech world. But at least it was hard to hack. Now the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway, is finally planning a more modern fare system that will allow riders to wave smartphones and certain kinds of credit cards and debit cards at the turnstiles. But will commuters have to worry about hackers following them down into the subway?    Officials of the transportation authority and the company developing the new system say they will do everything they can to keep passengers' personal information safe -- a concern in an age of data breaches, like the ones involving online services like Equifax, Yahoo and LinkedIn, retailers like Home Depot and Target or banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citibank.    The officials say they are prepared to play defense against hackers who would no doubt relish the challenge of causing hiccups -- or worse -- for a fare-collection system as large and as complicated as the one coming to New York.   At least the passengers should not have to worry about something known as ''card clash,'' which has been a headache for other transit systems that use the contactless fare collection technology -- a wave or tap of a card or smartphone at a turnstile or fare box -- that is being introduced in New York.   ''Card clash'' happens when a passenger waves a wallet or purse containing an Oyster card (in London) or a Ventra card (in Chicago) -- and a credit or debit card enabled for near-field communication, a form of electronic transmission that lets a reader in the turnstile receive information about the card. The card reader does not know which card to read, the card from the transit agency or the credit or debit card, and it could charge a payment to the wrong card. Transport for London's website says a passenger who falls victim to ''card clash'' could be charged two maximum fares -- on the way in and again on the way out.   Officials say that should not happen in New York with the new system, which will be installed starting late next year. When the fare-reading devices for New York pick up more than one credit card signal, a screen will display a message telling the passenger to choose one. Depending on how often it happens, it could replace ''Please swipe again'' in the commuter lexicon of dread.   The transportation authority in New York will sell an as-yet unnamed card of its own for riders who choose not to use a smartphone or credit card. New York will also have another feature that London's system uses: payment with a smartphone app, which security specialists say carries fewer security risks.   ''I would worry more about turnstile jumping,'' said Bruce Schneier, a security technologist who divides his time between Minneapolis and Cambridge, Mass. ''If I have a phone in my hand anyway, I'd rather wave it at a reader than fish in my wallet for something else.''   He also said that New York would benefit by piggybacking on others' experience. In other words, by not being the first to adopt the technology. ''It feels like the system has been shaken out in a bunch of cities,'' Mr. Schneier said, ''and it feels much more convenient.''   Other data experts echoed the idea that modernizing New York's fare-payment system involved balancing the risk of a catastrophic breach and the disclosure of passengers' credit card information against moving millions of people around the city.   ''Our infrastructure's creaky,'' said Mike Flowers, who oversaw data analytics for the Bloomberg administration from 2009 to 2013, and is now an executive at a data-technology company. ''They've got to do something. If enabling far greater communication between rider and ride provider is part of the grease to the cogs of that currently creaky system, I think it's a great idea and should move forward.''   He said the transit agency did need to be ''mindful of the responsibility of getting that deeper reach into people's day-to-day activity.''   Jon Weinstein, a spokesman for the transit agency, called safety the ''No. 1 priority, whether it's transporting our riders or protecting their personal information,'' adding that the agency and the companies it hired would safeguard passengers' information ''with the most stringent security standards and protocols.''   The company behind the new New York payment network, Cubic Transportation Systems -- also the company behind the MetroCard -- says its equipment processes $18 billion for transit operators around the world every year and has built layers of defense to minimize the risks. Its system encrypts data and transmits personal data like credit card numbers using a ''token,'' not the old-fashioned currency of the subway but a unique digital code generated by the system.   The president of Cubic, Matt Cole, said that the original Oyster Card in London, introduced in 2002, was cracked by researchers in Holland who set out to show it could be done. But in London, ''there were zero applications'' by hackers. He said that the company put in safeguards that would have called attention to anyone trying to use a fake card.   Transport for London, which operates the transit system, later switched to a more modern system ''that has not had any vulnerabilities,'' Mr. Cole said, but New York will get an even newer system based on banking industry standards. That, too, has been introduced in London, and, he said, there have not been hacking incidents there.   Still, Cubic is not immune to the perils of the information age. Last November, Cubic's system in San Francisco was hobbled by a virus that affected 900 office computers at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. The virus sent a message threatening to dump data stolen from the agency unless a ransom of about $73,000 in Bitcoin was paid.   Mr. Cole of Cubic said the company's system was disconnected from the transit agency's computers ''out of an abundance of caution'' to be certain the ransomware did not spread. The transit agency, which said it never considered making the ransom payment, reported that its network was not breached. That left open the possibility that the malware was activated through a link in an email.   Cubic expects more passengers in New York to wave smartphones more often than credit or debit cards. On the London Underground, contactless trips made with smartphones or with credit or debit cards now account for about 25 percent of the fares. At about 80 stations, including the one at Gatwick Airport, contactless payments outnumber Oyster Cards.   Data experts say that smartphones are less vulnerable to what Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum, called ''near-field mischief,'' which involves credit or debit cards enabled for near-field communication, a technology that is more common in Europe than in this country.   ''It's like skimming,'' she explained. The thieves are ''looking to add money to their own cards. Stealing people's identities is not the goal. There are easier ways of doing that.''   But ''near-field mischief'' remains a concern, as became apparent when she flew to Hong Kong recently for a conference of data experts. She said one of the experts who gave a presentation handed out Octopus cards, Hong Kong's version of Oyster cards, along with protective sleeves that prevent thieves from siphoning money off the fare cards.     "
"Uber Breach, Kept Secret for a Year, Hit 57 Million Accounts","SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber disclosed Tuesday that hackers had stolen 57 million driver and rider accounts and that the company had kept the data breach secret for more than a year after paying a $100,000 ransom. The deal was arranged by the company's chief security officer and under the watch of the former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, according to several current and former employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were private.    The security officer, Joe Sullivan, has been fired. Mr. Kalanick was forced out in June, although he remains on Uber's board.   The two hackers stole data about the company's riders and drivers -- including phone numbers, email addresses and names -- from a third-party server and then approached Uber and demanded $100,000 to delete their copy of the data, the employees said.    Uber acquiesced to the demands, and then went further. The company tracked down the hackers and pushed them to sign nondisclosure agreements, according to the people familiar with the matter. To further conceal the damage, Uber executives also made it appear as if the payout had been part of a ''bug bounty'' -- a common practice among technology companies in which they pay hackers to attack their software to test for soft spots.   The details of the attack remained hidden until Tuesday. The ride-hailing company said it had discovered the breach as part of a board investigation into Uber's business practices.   The breach at Uber is far from the most serious exposure of sensitive customer information. The two breaches  that Yahoo announced in 2016 eclipse Uber's in size, and an attack disclosed in September by Equifax, the consumer credit reporting agency, exposed a far deeper trove of personal information for a far larger group of people.   But the handling of the breach underscores the extent to which Uber executives were willing to go to protect the $70 billion ride-hailing giant's reputation and business, even at the potential cost of breaking users' trust and, perhaps more important, state and federal laws. The New York attorney general's office said on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into the matter.   Dara Khosrowshahi, who was chosen to be chief executive of Uber in late August, said he had only recently learned of the breach.   ''None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,'' Mr. Khosrowshahi said in a company blog post. ''While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes. We are changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of every decision we make and working hard to earn the trust of our customers.''   A spokeswoman for Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.   The revelation of the breach and the way it was kept quiet renewed questions about the tenure of Mr. Kalanick, who has faced criticism over his management style and practices after Uber came under scrutiny for its workplace culture this year. The New York Times also reported on a secret program called Greyball that had been undertaken on Mr. Kalanick's watch, in which Uber staff members surveilled law enforcement officials in order to evade them. Since his exit as chief executive, he has been sued by one of Uber's earlier investors for fraud.   The breach is also a black mark for Mr. Sullivan, who was a prominent figure in the information security industry. Mr. Sullivan joined Uber as the company's first chief security officer in 2015, after serving as the head of security at Facebook for seven years.   Unlike many cybersecurity executives, Mr. Sullivan was previously a lawyer and had studied cyberlaw at the University of Miami. He began his career in the technology industry as a federal prosecutor during the tech boom of the late 1990s, working at companies including eBay in 2002, where he was head of trust and safety.   Mr. Sullivan's decision to join Uber was seen as a win for the company. As Uber's ranks of drivers and riders had grown, people in and outside the company became worried about privacy and security. Uber had faced complaints about driver and rider assaults, as well as allegations that it was not doing enough to protect rider data. Mr. Sullivan was tasked with keeping drivers and riders safe.   The other Uber employee who was fired alongside Mr. Sullivan was Craig Clark, the company's legal director of security and law enforcement. Neither Mr. Sullivan nor Mr. Clark responded to requests for comment.   The company's decision to conceal the breach and pay the ransom quickly raised questions among security experts. Many have repeatedly warned companies against paying hackers a ransom to cover up breaches or return stolen data, advice that was included in a 2016 statement from the F.B.I. And several states including California have laws mandating that companies disclose when they are breached by hackers.   ''Companies are funding organized crime, an industry of criminals is being created,'' said Kevin Beaumont, a cybersecurity expert based in Britain. ''The good guys are creating a market for the bad guys. We're enabling them to monetize what years ago would have been teenagers in bedrooms breaching companies for fun.''   Uber has experienced breaches before. The company was hit with a data breach in May 2014, an event Uber discovered later that year and disclosed in February 2015. In that attack, the names and driver's licenses of more than 50,000 of the company's drivers were compromised.   This latest breach puts Uber in another difficult situation just as the company is working to repair its battered image and preparing to seek an initial public offering in 2019. Mr. Khosrowshahi has characterized his tenure at the company as ''Uber 2.0.'' As part of that, he has tossed out the aggressive corporate values that were prized by Mr. Kalanick and given the ride-hailing service a new list of values that includes ''doing the right thing. Period.''   Uber has hired Matt Olsen, former general counsel at the National Security Agency, as an adviser, and has retained Mandiant, a security firm, to conduct an independent investigation of the security breach. Uber said Mr. Olsen planned to reorganize the company's security team.   But the damage has already been done, and Uber officials are aware of the long road back to good standing with the public.   While it is not illegal to pay money to hackers, Uber may have violated several laws in its interaction with them.   By demanding that the hackers destroy the stolen data, Uber may have violated a Federal Trade Commission rule on breach disclosure that prohibits companies from destroying any forensic evidence in the course of their investigation.   The company may have also violated state breach disclosure laws by not disclosing the theft of Uber drivers' stolen data. If the data stolen was not encrypted, Uber would have been required by California state law to disclose that driver's license data from its drivers had been stolen in the course of the hacking.

DealBook Briefing: Trump Is Still Not a Fan of AT&T-Time Warner,"Good Tuesday afternoon. The business community is buzzing about the F.C.C.'s plan to dismantle landmark net neutrality regulations and the Justice Department's lawsuit to block AT&T's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner. (Want this in your own email inbox each morning? Here's the sign-up.) Uber disclosed a data breach it kept secret for a year.     The Justice Department is using AT&T's own words against it.     The F.C.C. chairman wants the government to ''stop micromanaging the internet.''    Is Big business quietly rooting for AT&T and Time Warner?    The F.C.C.'s plan to repeal net neutrality is good news for AT&T.   Uber kept a data breach secret for a year.   The ride-hailing company disclosed that it was the victim of a data breach last October that affected 57 million driver and rider accounts. Information on driver and rider names, emails and telephone numbers had been compromised by the attack.   Here other key details:    The two hackers approached Uber demanding payment for the stolen data and proof of the deletion of the data.    Uber did not make the breach public and instead paid the hackers $100,000 to ensure the stolen data was expunged.    Uber fired its chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, for keeping the breach a secret for more than a year.    The issue came to light in recent months after an investigation by Uber's board into the company's past.   Extra Credit: The revelation of the breach and the way it was kept quiet raises more questions about the tenure of Travis Kalanick, Uber's co-founder who was chief executive at the time of the breach.   Trump is still not a fan of AT&T-Time Warner.   Speaking to reporters today,  President Trump said: ''Personally, I've always felt that that was a deal that's not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up. But I'm not going to get involved, it's litigation.''   The comment comes a day after the Justice Department sued to block AT&T's $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner.   The president has long criticized the deal. When the deal was announced in October 2016, candidate Trump said: ''As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.''   The Justice Department is using AT&T's own words against it.   AT&T and Time Warner had trumpeted the competitive advantages the deal would bring in making their case to shareholders, Bloomberg BusinessWeek's Peter Coy points out. Now the Justice Department has turned to the two companies' past comments to build its argument for blocking the transaction.   Here's a sampling from the Justice Department's complaint:   As AT&T has expressly recognized, however, distributors that control popular programming ''have the incentive and ability to use (and indeed have used whenever and wherever they can) that control as a weapon to hinder competition.''   As DirecTV has explained, such vertically integrated programmers ''can much more credibly threaten to withhold programming from rival [distributors]'' and can ''use such threats to demand higher prices and more favorable terms.''   As AT&T/DirecTV's strategic merger documents state, after the merger, disruption need not occur immediately--the merged firm can ''operate [its] pay-TV business as a 'cash cow' while slowly pivoting to new models.''   As DirecTV itself has explained: ''[V]ertical integration of programming and distribution can, if left unchecked, give the integrated entity the incentive and ability to gain an unfair advantage over its rivals. This ultimately results in higher prices and lower quality service for consumers.''   AT&T/DirecTV executives have concluded that the ''runway'' for the decline of traditional payTV ''may be longer than some think given the economics of the space,'' and that it is ''upon us to utilize our assets to extend that runway.''   AT&T itself has previously stated that access to some of the most popular television programming is ''critical to preserve and promote competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming.''   While the comments put AT&T in an uncomfortable position, precedent favors AT&T, and many analysts believe the company will prevail if the case goes to court. Write analysts over at Cowen:   ''After reviewing DOJ's lawsuit against AT&T-Time Warner and watching AT&T's press conference, we still see a settlement as possible and, failing that, we believe AT&T would prevail in court.''   The F.C.C. chairman wants to 'stop micromanaging the internet.'   The Federal Communications Commission announced Tuesday that it planned to dismantle landmark net neutrality regulations that ensure equal access to the internet.   ''Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,'' F.C.C. chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. ''Instead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that's best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.''   The move is a win for the giant telecoms like AT&T and Verizon as well as the big cable providers such as Comcast.   ''The losers could be internet sites that will have to answer telecom firms to get their content in front of consumers. And consumers may see their bills increase for the best quality of internet service.''   Is Big business quietly rooting for AT&T and Time Warner?   Andrew worked the phones yesterday and hears:   Media executives at the other big content and distribution providers privately tell me that they hope AT&T and Time Warner do not find a way to settle. They are confident that the companies will win in court and hope that would put pressure on the Justice Department as it examines future deals.   A Justice Department official told reporters yesterday that the regulator isn't reflexively against ''vertical'' mergers, despite the department's legal complaint arguing that this particular one would concentrate too much power in one company.   There's a question of whether the Justice Department's lawsuit would chill a busy period for mergers. Yet if the government wins, some deal making will continue -- including some involving Time Warner. The WSJ points out that the forces that compelled Time Warner to sell itself aren't going away.   As Michael Nathanson of the research firm Moffett Nathanson told the WSJ: ''I don't think things will stay quiet.''

(Breakingviews)    Ken Brown writes, ''The flaw in Wall Street's thinking was that precedent would hold in an administration that doesn't highly value precedent.'' (WSJ)    Tara Lachapelle writes, ''Both Time Warner and AT&T have plunged as the U.S. Justice Department tries to stop their merger, but AT&T needs the deal far more because it's the linchpin of its video strategy.'' (Gadfly)   The F.C.C.'s plan to repeal net neutrality is good news for AT&T.   The telecommunications giant and its peers have lobbied hard against the Obama administration's efforts to prevent broadband providers from charging higher fees to access particular websites or online services like Netflix. Now the F.C.C. under Chairman Ajit Pai is poised to roll those initiatives back.   More from Cecilia Kang of the NYT:   Mr. Pai plans to accompany the repeal of net neutrality with several other measures that will also benefit broadband companies, said the people with knowledge of the matter. That includes suggesting that the Federal Trade Commission, which has traditionally not brought many cases, be the enforcement agency of net neutrality violations, they said.

Here's how Steven Rattner, the financier who oversees Michael Bloomberg's wealth and was on the steering committee of Fix the Debt, explained the apparent conundrum in Andrew's latest column:   ''It's not completely irrational to say the tax code is a disaster,'' Mr. Rattner said. ''What's going on here is that the importance of reforming the tax code trumps, excuse the pun, fixing the debt.''   But Pete Peterson, the Blackstone co-founder and perhaps the most outspoken billionaire on the issue of the federal deficit, is having none of it. He told Andrew:   ''Mortgaging our fiscal future for trillions in temporary tax cuts will hurt our economy over time, and every C.E.O. should know that,'' he said. ''True business patriots need to advocate for their country as well as their company.''

Insiders Accused of Stealing Personal Data From Homeland Security,"WASHINGTON -- It was an audacious scheme: an attempted inside job at the office of a federal watchdog agency, where the cops, the authorities said, became the robbers. Three employees in the inspector general's office for the Department of Homeland Security stole a computer system that contained sensitive personal information of about 246,000 agency employees, according to three United States officials and a report sent to Congress last week. They planned to modify the office's proprietary software for managing investigative and disciplinary cases so that they could market and sell it to other inspector general offices across the federal government.  The Homeland Security Department is investigating, along with the United States attorney's office for the District of Columbia. The personal information included names, social security numbers and dates of birth -- a rich trove of data not unlike those stolen from other government agencies in high-profile cases in recent years. On the home computer of one of the suspects that was seized during a raid in the spring, investigators also found about 159,000 case files. But investigators determined the private information was not, in fact, their target. Investigators believe the suspects intended to use the data to ""facilitate the development and testing of"" their knockoff system, according to the report. In May, the office of the inspector general, John Roth, first notified several congressional committees with oversight of the Homeland Security Department, including the committees for homeland security, appropriations and commerce. Additional updates were sent to those panels in June and another last week. Mr. Roth did not identify the employees, one of whom has left the office, and the American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing case, declined to name them. The two current employees have been suspended pending the results of the investigation. In its report to Congress, Mr. Roth's office said that it had ""seized all known servers and other devices potentially containing exfiltrated data in the possession of the subjects."" A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on Tuesday about the investigation. William Miller, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Washington, said he could not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. The breach was earlier reported by USA Today. In the past two years, several government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the State Department and the National Security Agency, have had data stolen, American officials said. The most significant case was in 2015, when hackers linked to the Chinese military stole records connected to more than 21 million government employees, including those with high-level security clearances. The acting secretary for homeland security, Elaine Duke, elected in August to notify victims of the breach and the department is in the process of doing so, according to its most recent report to Congress. In recent weeks, the department has asked its component agencies to try to find additional money from their budgets to cover the hundreds of thousands of dollars needed to to monitor the credit scores of affected employees, according to an official familiar with the request.

Hackers See Weak Link In Celebrities' Vendors,"In December, hackers impersonating an executive at Interscope Records, the record label owned by Universal Music Group, managed to bypass all the latest in digital defenses with a simple email. In a carefully tailored message, the hackers urged an executive at September Management, a music management business, and another at Cherrytree Music Company, a management and record company, to send them Lady Gaga's stem files -- files used by music engineers and producers for remixing and remastering.    With a click of a button, the files made their way into hackers' hands, according to three people who are familiar with the episode but are not allowed to discuss it publicly. Executives would not elaborate on the incident, and it is unclear what happened to the files.    The heist -- which has not been reported previously -- was a classic example of how hackers exploit the weakest link in the extensive chain of vendors, postproduction studios and collaborators that corporations must trust with their most valuable intellectual property.   In Hollywood, cybercriminals have found a lucrative niche: While they may not be able to break into a Universal Studios or a Netflix directly, they have learned that the highest-profile targets are supported by a system of soft targets -- content collaborators, remixers, postproduction studios and others -- that do not have the same resources, security technology or sense of paranoia. And the hackers have started capitalizing.   Last month, a hacker or hackers using the pseudonym ''TheDarkOverlord'' leaked unreleased episodes of the Netflix hit series ''Orange Is the New Black'' after breaching Larson Studios, one in a long line of postproduction players that Netflix relies on to tailor its content for high-definition television.   TheDarkOverlord released Netflix episodes after Larson Studios, and then Netflix, didn't pay a ransom of 30 bitcoins, roughly $45,000. Now, that same hacker has threatened to leak content from Larson's other clients, including ABC, Fox, National Geographic and IFC, if the studios do not pay.   In a message posted to Twitter, the hacker said: ''Who is next on the list? FOX, IFC, NAT GEO, and ABC. Oh, what fun we're all going to have. We're not playing any games anymore.'' A couple of days later, TheDarkOverlord hinted that the next leaks were imminent: ''It's nearly time to play another round.''   For now, Hollywood studios say they have no intention of paying hackers' ransom, though they could pay dearly in lost revenue and viewers.   ''We see this over and over and over again,'' said Oren Falkowitz, chief executive of Area 1, a security company. ''The problem is that security firms sell their software to the 1 percent of companies that can afford it, but the real damage continues to come from below.''   The security weaknesses of vendors are increasingly the weaknesses of their clients, no matter how fortified their own networks.   The vast majority of breaches -- 80 percent by some estimates -- stem from a supplier or vendor, according to RiskVision, a risk intelligence company. At Target, hackers stole tens of millions of credit card details by penetrating a tiny Pittsburgh refrigeration company that had been given access to the retail chain's network.   Chinese state hackers breached the defense contractor Lockheed Martin through RSA, a company it had entrusted to secure employees' web connections. Hackers breached an oil company through a PDF of a Chinese takeout menu.   Mr. Falkowitz, other security executives and insurance underwriters say the status quo is untenable. Security companies have promised to protect their clients from cyberattacks, while ignoring the less secure vendors, consultants and distributors in clients' supply chains.   Area 1 has started extending its services to its clients' principal vendors as part of its core offering, something that most security companies have been reluctant to do.   ''It's our job to protect your business,'' Mr. Falkowitz said. ''We're not going to sell software to every five-person mom-and-pop shop, so why not extend our services to those vendors for free?''   Companies like BitSight Technologies and SecurityScorecard in have developed a rating system that allows corporations and government agencies to evaluate how hacker-friendly vendors and other third parties are.   BitSight uses a scoring system of 250 to 900, similar to a credit score. SecurityScorecard gives grades from A to F.   ''You could have the most technically secure organization in the world, but the common denominator is people, and they are always susceptible,'' said Jay Kaplan, chief executive of Synack, a security company.   Corporations hire Synack to perform sophisticated ''penetration tests'' of their networks, and increasingly those of their suppliers. Synack then works with hackers they consider trustworthy, many of them freelancers, to find weaknesses in their clients' systems.   Some of Synack's clients -- and increasingly some insurance underwriters -- have started asking the company to look into possible vendors. When Synack gets a vendor's permission, it performs a full-fledged penetration test to try to break into its network. When it does not have permission, Synack's hackers scan for open connections like wide-open ports and servers and easily crackable passwords to get a sense of a vendor's security.   Most likely, hackers with bad intent are looking to do the same. For years, hackers tried to extort money from companies by taking their websites offline with floods of internet traffic -- often during prime holiday shopping -- and not letting up until their victims paid. More recently, cybercriminals have deployed ransomware, malware that encrypts data and locks out the user.   Now hackers are resorting to old-fashioned extortion. Last year, TheDarkOverlord -- the hacker believed to be behind the attacks against Netflix and Hollywood studios -- menaced a midsize investment bank, a glue company, a cancer charity, health care providers and other charities across the country.   In each case, the hacker made what it called a ''handsome business proposal'': Pay a ransom, or see files deleted, sold or published online.   In January, hackers breached Little Red Door Cancer Services of East Central Indiana, wiping its servers and backups and demanding that it pay 50 bitcoin, about $80,000, to have the data restored.   These days, TheDarkOverlord has focused on the entertainment industry, where it found that it can easily get to Hollywood's crown jewels -- its unreleased content. And there's more money in Hollywood than in charity.     "
"In China, Mining a Fortune in Bitcoin","DALAD BANNER, China -- They worked as factory hands, in the coal business and as farmers. Their spirits rose when a coal boom promised to bring factories and jobs to this land of grassy plains in Inner Mongolia. When the boom ebbed, they looked for work wherever they could. Today, many have found it at a place that makes money -- the digital kind.     Here, in what is locally called the Dalad Economic Development Zone, lies one of the biggest Bitcoin farms in the world. These eight factory buildings with blue-tin roofs account for nearly one-twentieth of the world's daily production of the cryptocurrency.   Based on today's prices, it issues $318,000 in digital currency a day.   From the outside, the factory -- owned by a company called Bitmain China -- does not look much different from the other buildings in the industrial park.   Its neighbors include chemical plants and aluminum smelters. Some of the buildings in the zone were never finished. Except for the occasional coal-carrying truck, the roads are largely silent.   Inside, instead of heavy industrial machinery, workers tend rows and rows of computers -- nearly 25,000 computers in all -- crunching the mathematical problems that create Bitcoin.   Workers carry laptop computers as they walk the aisles looking for breakdowns and checking cable connections. They fill water tanks that keep the computers from melting down or bursting into flame. Around them, hundreds of thousands of cooling fans fill the building with whooshing white noise.   Bitcoin's believers say it will be the currency of the future. Purely electronic, it can be sent across borders anonymously without oversight by a central authority. That makes it appealing to a diverse and sometimes mismatched group that includes tech enthusiasts, civil libertarians, hackers and criminals.   Bitcoin is also, by and large, made in China. The country makes more than two-thirds of all Bitcoin issued daily. Bitmain, founded by Jihan Wu, a former investment analyst, makes money mostly by selling equipment to make Bitcoins, as well as mining the currency itself.   China has mixed feelings about Bitcoin.   On one hand, the government worries that Bitcoin will allow Chinese people to bypass its strict limits on how much money they can send abroad, and could also be used to commit crimes. Chinese officials are moving to close Bitcoin exchanges, where the currency is bought and sold, though they have not set a time frame. While that would not affect Bitcoin manufacturing directly, it would make buying and selling Bitcoin more expensive in one of its major markets, potentially hurting prices.   On the other hand, the digital currency may represent an opportunity for China to push into new technologies, a motivation behind its extensive push into other cutting-edge areas, like driverless cars and artificial intelligence. China continues to offer Bitcoin makers like Bitmain cheap electricity -- making Bitcoin requires immense amounts of power -- and other inducements.   Dalad Banner may be far away from Beijing's internet start-up scene and southern China's gadget hub. Still, many of the workers and surrounding residents see a digital opportunity for Dalad Banner and the rest of their part of Inner Mongolia, an area famous in China for half-finished factories and towns so empty that they are sometimes called ghost cities.   ''Now the mine has about 50 employees,'' said Wang Wei, the manager of Bitmain China's Dalad Banner facility, using one of several metaphors for the work being done there. ''I feel in the future it might bring hundreds or even thousands of jobs, like the big factories.''   Mr. Wang, a 36-year-old resident and former coal salesman, purchased one Bitcoin about six months ago. It has since more than doubled in value. ''I made quite a lot of money,'' he said.   China also sees a potential new source of jobs, particularly in underdeveloped places like Dalad Banner. The county of about 370,000 people on the edge of the vast Kubuqi Desert boasts coal reserves and coal-powered heavy industries like steel. But it lags behind much of the rest of the country in broadly developing its economy. It is part of the urban area of Ordos, a city about 350 miles away from Beijing famous for its empty buildings.   Dalad Banner is not the sort of place that at first glance looks like a home for high-tech work. Indeed, the idea took some getting used to, even among the workers.   ''I didn't know anything about Bitcoin then,'' said Li Shuangsheng, a 28-year-old resident who maintains the operations of one of the eight factories.   He bounced from job to job -- the chemical plant was too noisy and polluted, he said -- before he landed about one month ago at Bitmain China's Dalad Banner factory, one of the few lucrative job opportunities in the sparsely populated region.   Mr. Li does not yet own any Bitcoin, but he is happy with the work and studying up on the subject online when family time permits.   ''Now,'' he said, ''I'm starting to have some idea.''   Many at the farm have experienced the ups and downs of the local economy.   Bai Xiaotu was laid off from a state-owned furniture factory in 1997. He had been doing different menial jobs until he went to work at Bitmain's Dalad Banner farm in December as a cleaner.   ''Look around, there are abandoned factories on both sides of our farm,'' said Mr. Bai, a 53-year-old with a weather-beaten face. ''Many factories are not doing that great.''   But the industry is still new to most. Bai Dong, Mr. Bai's 31-year-old son, had never heard of Bitcoin when his father first got the job. After searching on the internet, he found that the Bitcoin price was rising quickly and that the farm was one of the biggest in the world. ''I feel positive about the future of the industry,'' Mr. Bai said.   But he is still confused what Bitcoin mining is.   ''We have coal mines,'' he said. ''Now we have a Bitcoin mine. They are both mines. What's their relationship?''     "
Exchange in China to Stop Bitcoin Trading,"BEIJING -- A major Chinese exchange specializing in the trading of Bitcoin announced on Thursday that it would stop trading by the end of the month, amid a broader crackdown against virtual currencies by the authorities in Beijing. The announcement by BTC China, the country's first and largest digital currency exchange, came days after the Chinese authorities banned fund-raising for new digital currencies, and amid worries that regulators would tighten rules surrounding currencies like Bitcoin.    The exchange's decision is the first of its kind in China, and it raises the specter of other exchanges shutting down Bitcoin trading in the future.    China has sought to walk a tightrope when it comes to Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies. Whereas the currencies provide the country with a chance to develop new and emerging technologies, officials also worry that they would allow Chinese consumers to get around tough restrictions on how much money they can send overseas and allow them to be used to launder money.   Still, the impending closing of BTC China's online currency trading operations is a blow to the country's aspirations to lead the way in the sector. Some two-thirds of all Bitcoin issued daily is ''mined'' in China, and an array of other companies benefit from such efforts, including equipment suppliers and construction firms that build enormous Bitcoin farms.   ''It's a sad day for the Bitcoin community here in China,'' said Wei-Tek Tsai, the director of the Digital Society and Blockchain Laboratory at Beijing's Beihang University.   In a statement published on the messaging platform WeChat, BTC China said it would ''stop all trading on September 30.'' It said the move was in response to a decision this month by Chinese regulators to ban so-called initial coin offerings, in which new digital currencies seek to raise funds.   The price of Bitcoin dropped more than 10 percent on Thursday, to around $3,500, in the hours after the announcement.   Bitcoin is increasingly in the spotlight around the world. Its proponents -- a group that includes tech enthusiasts, civil libertarians, hackers and criminals -- cheer the fact that it can be sent across borders anonymously and that it is not regulated by a central authority like a typical currency.   China has emerged as the leading force in Bitcoin trading in recent years. But as the virtual currency's profile has risen in the country, Chinese regulators have increasingly sought to control how it is traded and used. When they stepped up their oversight of Bitcoin trading this year, it led to a rapid and substantial drop in trading volumes.   ''Because it is traded anonymously and peer to peer, Bitcoin makes it easy for money laundering and tax evasion,'' said Sheng Songcheng, an adviser to the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank.   Official Chinese news media has cited officials as saying they want to close Bitcoin exchanges -- a move that precipitated Thursday's decision by BTC China -- though they have not set a time frame.   China Business Network, a financial and business news portal, said on Thursday that the authorities in Shanghai, where BTC China is registered, would close all Bitcoin exchanges within their jurisdiction by the end of the month; and the report piled on further uncertainty.   Though the moves by the Chinese authorities this month have resulted in declines in the value of Bitcoin, some argue that they will allow for a more even geographic distribution in the online currency's trading and mining.   ''The overall share of Chinese exchanges has been diminishing steadily,'' said Thomas Glucksmann, marketing manager for the Hong Kong-based Bitcoin exchange Gatecoin. Mr. Glucksmann said that much of the Bitcoin community had been concerned about the increased level of scrutiny in China and had been moving their assets out of the country.   ''People will realize that China is out of the picture for the moment,'' he said.     "
Bitcoin Technology to Power Database Used by World's Largest Banks,"After months of talk and hype, the world's biggest banks have taken the first steps toward moving a significant piece of financial infrastructure onto a so-called blockchain -- the technology introduced to the world by the virtual currency Bitcoin. The company that serves as the back end for much Wall Street trading -- the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, or D.T.C.C. -- said on Monday that it would replace one of its central databases, used by the largest banks in the world, with new software inspired by Bitcoin. The organization, based in New York, plays a role in recording and reporting nearly every stock and bond trade in the United States, as well as most valuable derivatives trades.     IBM, which has been making a big push into blockchain technology, will be leading the project for the D.T.C.C. and aims to have it fully functioning by early next year.   ''This is a real tangible step into what could be a very different future for Wall Street,'' Michael C. Bodson, the chief executive of the D.T.C.C., said in an interview.   The announcement is one of the most advanced steps yet in Wall Street's continuing effort to harness the technological concepts underlying Bitcoin.   Financial institutions around the world have been fascinated by Bitcoin not because of the volatile virtual currency itself, but because it introduced a new way of executing and recording financial transactions without a central authority.   All Bitcoin transactions take place on a global financial ledger known as a blockchain, which is maintained and updated by a network of thousands of computers around the world, similar to the way that Wikipedia is kept up by diffuse volunteers rather than by a single company.   Wall Street has been drawn to the blockchain concept because it allows information to be recorded in real time without the bottleneck that central authorities generally introduce. The decentralized nature of the technology also makes it harder for attackers, or hackers, to take control of the network.   The D.T.C.C. project will not use Bitcoin's blockchain. Instead it is building something similar to a blockchain, known as a distributed ledger, which multiple financial institutions can update and view at the same time. Unlike Bitcoin's blockchain, the D.T.C.C. ledger will be open only to invited participants.   Mr. Bodson said the basic promise of a distributed ledger is that it provides ''one version of the truth that everyone shares and everyone utilizes.''   The new ledger will replace an existing database, known as the Trade Information Warehouse, that records information about every credit default swap trade that comes through the D.T.C.C. Credit default swaps, which played a major role in the 2008 financial crisis, are essentially bets on the success of bonds.   The D.T.C.C. oversaw about $11 trillion in credit default swaps trading last year, or 80 percent of all trades in the global market. Banks rely on the Trade Information Warehouse to determine when payments are due and what size they will be.   Because the database will be edited in group fashion, the hope is that it will provide a more streamlined and reliable source of information.   Mr. Bodson said that if the database was successful, the D.T.C.C. could use the technology to move money rather than just record information.   Over the last few years, most banks have announced efforts to explore the potential utility of blockchain technology. This has gone to the highest levels, with some central banks talking about moving their own national currencies onto some sort of blockchain.   But while there have been endless announcements about tests and proofs of concept, almost no one has disclosed plans to actually use a blockchain or distributed ledger in the real world.   Until now, the most discussed announcement came from the Australian stock exchange, which said in early 2016 that it had hired an American software company, Digital Asset Holdings, to build a distributed ledger for its back-end systems. The Australian exchange, though, has said it has not made a final decision on whether it will move to the new technology.   The D.T.C.C. has been talking publicly about its interest in the blockchain for a while, and last year it announced that it had successfully completed a test of a distributed ledger database in its credit default swaps trading business. Mr. Bodson said that since then the D.T.C.C. had determined that a distributed ledger would be cheaper to run than its existing system.   The D.T.C.C. tests were done using a distributed ledger technology created by a start-up, Axoni, that will also be involved in the project, along with R3, a consulting firm working with dozens of banks on blockchain projects, and IBM.   ''The fact that they are taking this as seriously as they are is indicative of the broad-felt sense in the financial community that this technology is here to stay,'' Charley Cooper, a managing director of R3, said of the D.T.C.C.

One Surprise Is Already Clear in the German Elections: No Russian Meddling,"BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel's summons to Germany's top cabinet ministers and senior military and intelligence officials for a meeting of the Federal Security Council signaled trouble. Such gatherings are rare, typically occurring only when the country faces a grave threat like a terrorist attack. There was just one item on the agenda that day last spring: how to protect Germany's upcoming parliamentary elections from Russian cyberattacks. At the time, it seemed almost inevitable that Germany would suffer the same fate as France and the United States, where, officials say, the Kremlin attempted to alter the results of presidential elections with ''fake news'' and spear phishing attacks.    But on the eve of Sunday's elections, the Russians have done something few expected: they have largely disappeared. The trolls who spread distorted and falsified information before earlier elections have failed to make much of a splash here. The websites of the campaigns and major news media outlets are operating like normal.    Germans, according to Sandro Gaycken, the director of the Digital Society Institute in Berlin, which has been monitoring for Russian meddling, are ''almost disappointed that nothing is happening.''   ''We don't see any verified attacks,'' he said. ''We're not really expecting any Russian interference.''   In some respects, experts say, German elections are insulated from outside interference in ways those in the United States are not. The country's politics are not as polarized as they are in the United States, where partisan enmity provided fertile ground for Russian efforts to sow confusion with distorted and falsified information amplified by Russian-controlled Twitter bots and Facebook accounts.   In a move that would seem unimaginable in the United States, the campaigns for the major political parties entered into a ''gentleman's agreement'' this year not to exploit any information that might be leaked as a result of a cyberattack.   Germans also still largely trust their mainstream, traditional news media sources and, unlike Americans, tend to be wary of information disseminated on Facebook and Twitter.   Officials warn that there is still a chance that some 16 gigabytes of sensitive information stolen two years ago by Kremlin-backed hackers from Germany's Parliament, the Bundestag, could surface, much like emails taken from the campaign of Emanuel Macron were dumped days before the election in France.   In January, someone registered two websites, btleaks.info and btleaks.org, which reminiscent of the DCLeaks website that served as a repository for documents stolen from the Democratic National Committee last year. Staffers from Germany's domestic intelligence agency have been assigned to check those websites hourly.   But few think the information if leaked would make much difference at this point. The latest polls show Ms. Merkel in a comfortable lead ahead of her chief rivals, making it likely that she will secure a fourth term as chancellor.   So why has Russia held back?   After failing to defeat Mr. Macron or so far obtain any positive dividends from its support of the Trump campaign, it is possible, experts say, that the Kremlin has decided to rethink its approach.   Russian influence operations, or active measures as they are known, tend to work only if no one is expecting them. Unlike the Obama administration, which chose to remain silent about Russia's meddling for months before the election last November, German officials cannot seem to stop talking about the threat.   Weeks after the election of President Trump, Bruno Kahl, the head of Germany's foreign intelligence service, the BND, warned of cyberattacks aimed at ''delegitimizing the democratic process'' in Germany. Ms. Merkel herself has issued similar warnings.   ''It makes absolutely no sense to conduct cyber-ops because everyone is waiting for it,'' Dr. Gaycken said. ''It would almost make more sense for the C.I.A. to leak fake news to make it seem like the Russians did it.''   Ripjar, a data analytics company founded by former members of Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, says that scores of automated bots on Twitter and other social media sites have been pushing anti-Merkel and anti-immigrant messaging in German. The messages appear to align with Kremlin positions ahead of the election, but do not seem to have had much resonance.   ''It is a very blunt tool that I would assess has very little impact on the world,'' said David Balson, Ripjar's director of intelligence.   Perhaps Germany's greatest protection is not some 21st century innovation but old-fashioned paper ballots, counted by hand, that are essentially hack proof.   It would be a mistake to think the aggressive Russian interference in elections last year represented some kind of new norm, said Thomas Rid, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who is writing a book on Russian active measures. These types of operations, he said, are extremely difficult to pull off and, as the world has seen, can backfire. In many ways, he said, the Russians just got lucky.   ''I think one of the risks of the 2016 operation is that we all overestimate how much you can achieve from it and how easy it is,'' he said. ''You just can't replicate this in the country every time.''   Nevertheless, Germans prepared well in advance for any hint of Russian interference.   The Federal Office for Information Security ran penetration tests looking for vulnerabilities in computer systems and software of the federal election authority. The Bundestag and the individual campaigns consulted with experts about strengthening their computer security. And major news media outlets established teams of fact checkers to protect against fake news.   German officials are now looking beyond the elections at ways to bolster the country's cyberdefenses even further.   At the Federal Security Council meeting, which was held in March, officials hammered out what has become known as the ''hack-back'' strategy. The plan is to try to turn the tables on the hackers, launching offensive cyberattacks against them and destroying their online infrastructure before any real damage can be done.   While the German military can now legally launch a cyber-offensive following hacker attacks on military resources, there is no provision in German law allowing for the country's cyber forces to respond to attacks on civilian infrastructure like the power grid, hospitals or servers that process election results.   ''Our cyber-defenses are Swiss cheese,'' said Jacob Schrot, a Bundestag staffer responsible for intelligence oversight and cybersecurity matters.   Russia is not the only threat on this front. Germans are still angry about revelations made by Edward Snowden that the National Security Agency under President Barack Obama had hacked into Ms. Merkel's cellphone.   Though a precise plan of action has yet to be implemented, that federal authorities would even consider taking offensive action against an enemy is a measure of how seriously the country has come to view the cyber threat.   Enduring trauma of the Nazi era has made Germans squeamish about flexing their country's military muscles. But Russia's recent history of revanchism under President Vladimir V. Putin -- not just interfering in elections but supporting hard-right nationalist parties in Europe and dabbling in military adventures, like the annexation of Crimea and instigation of war in eastern Ukraine -- has forced Germans to confront a new reality.   Marian Wendt, a member of Parliament from Ms. Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union, who oversees cybersecurity issues, said in an interview that Germany would prefer cooperation with Mr. Putin and Russia. But he said Germany also had a responsibility to protect itself.   ''At some point you have to attack your attackers,'' he said.   The hack-back strategy has stirred controversy here, with some charging that it comes close to violating Germany's constitutional prohibition of offensive warfare adopted after the country's defeat in World War II. Cyber experts also question whether Germany possesses the technical expertise to pull off such a tactic, particularly against Russia's own highly advanced teams of cyber warriors.   ''Our main challenge right now is a shortage of skilled I.T. security workers,'' said Sven Herpig, a cybersecurity expert with a German think tank, Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. ''Why do we waste the few talents that we have on the offensive side when we could actually use them on the defensive side.''   Germany's talk of offensive cyber actions could also escalate tensions with the Kremlin, said Mr. Rid, from Johns Hopkins University. And with Russia quiet at the moment, many question the wisdom of provoking it.   ''Loose German talk of hack-back,'' Mr. Rid said, ''could translate into Russian as 'bring it on.'''     "
"In a Twist, Assange Offers Help to Fix Software Flaws","WASHINGTON -- For years, Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been derided as an anti-American anarchist, indiscriminate in publishing leaks and far too cozy with Russia. For more than four years, he has been hiding out in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid sexual assault investigators in Sweden. But on Thursday, fresh from revealing the largest leak of classified documents in C.I.A. history, Mr. Assange tried to turn the tables on his critics, presenting himself as a defender of the United States' top technology companies from overreaching, double-dealing American spies.    The 8,000 C.I.A. documents that WikiLeaks made public this week -- the first installment in a far larger collection, Mr. Assange said -- showed that the agency had found flaws in the most popular products of the internet age: iPhones, Android phones, software used in every office and even internet-connected televisions. But instead of alerting the companies so they could plug the security holes, the agency exploited the weaknesses to carry out cyberspying around the world.    So Mr. Assange, speaking by video in an online news conference, offered a lifeline to the companies, saying the antisecrecy organization was prepared to share leaked computer code that it has not yet published with Apple, Google and other technology companies to help them fix the flaws described in the leaked C.I.A. documents.   ''We have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured,'' Mr. Assange said.   The companies reacted cautiously to the WikiLeaks offer, saying there could be legal complications in accepting classified information stolen from the government. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, advised the companies to seek legal advice before accepting the leaked code.   ''I do think that I would check with the Department of Justice in particular about if a program or a piece of information is classified,'' he said at a press briefing. ''It remains classified regardless of whether or not it is released into the public venue or not.''   Microsoft suggested in a statement that it did not want to be seen as collaborating with WikiLeaks, declaring dryly that its ''preferred method for anyone with knowledge of security issues, including the C.I.A. or WikiLeaks, is to submit details to us at secure@microsoft.com'' Microsoft, Apple and Google all said that some of the C.I.A. attacks had targeted old versions of their software and would be blocked by recent updates.   WikiLeaks' reputation was marred in some circles by its previous splash in the news, the release last year of emails from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that were believed to have come from Russian government hackers. Now Mr. Assange, who once worked as a computer security specialist, insists that his goal was to safeguard the privacy of everyone's communications from the intrusive gaze of the C.I.A.   ''Why has the Central Intelligence Agency not acted with speed to come together with Apple, Microsoft and other manufacturers to defend us all from its own weapons systems?'' he asked.   The C.I.A. issued an unusually lengthy response, emphasizing that any spying it does is restricted by law to foreigners and foreign countries, with Americans off limits.   ''As we've said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,'' the C.I.A. statement said. ''Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, C.I.A. continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries.''   By his offer, Assange was inserting WikiLeaks into a strained relationship between the government and Silicon Valley, where some executives believe their products' reputations are endangered by aggressive American espionage efforts.   The Obama administration addressed this conflict by setting up a formal review process for technical vulnerabilities that the government discovered -- or purchased from hackers.   When an intelligence agency or the F.B.I. wanted to make use of a major chink in a company's technological armor, it first had to get approval through a committee organized by the White House. At a sort of court of vulnerabilities, intelligence agencies argued for using the flaw for surveillance, while other officials made the case for revealing it to Apple, Microsoft, Google or some other firm.   ''The default position was to disclose the vulnerability,'' said Michael Daniel, the cybersecurity coordinator at the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, who ran the process. Last year, the administration said in congressional testimony that over 80 percent of vulnerabilities discovered by the government had been revealed to the industry.   But there were moments, Mr. Daniel said on Thursday, when the committee he assembled judged that it was in the national interest to keep secret a ''zero day'' flaw -- so named because the target would have zero days of notice that there was a vulnerability. That would give the National Security Agency, the C.I.A. or the F.B.I. time to exploit it.   Not all of the flaws revealed in the new WikiLeaks trove of C.I.A. documents would necessarily have gone through this process, and the committee would not have reviewed the ''tools,'' or software techniques, used to exploit a vulnerability. But Mr. Daniel said that ''all the appropriate agencies, including the C.I.A., participated in this process.'' That suggests that using at least some of the vulnerabilities exposed by WikiLeaks would have required White House approval.   A new RAND Corporation study concludes that these ''zero day'' exploits, and the vulnerabilities they are based on, last longer than most thought. It found that the average vulnerability had a ''life expectancy'' of 6.9 years before it became useless to hackers.   Brian White, the chief operating officer of RedOwl Analytics, a cybersecurity firm, said the companies were caught between conflicting pressures, especially if some of their employees have security clearances to work on government contracts.   ''If you are holding a security clearance and you engage in the movement or sharing of this data, you could have your clearance revoked,'' he said.   But he said that companies like Apple and Google also had a responsibility to their shareholders and customers to make their products as safe as possible. ''The likelihood of prosecution is much less important than understanding any vulnerability in their products,'' he said.   In addition to the legal quandary, dealing with Mr. Assange, a mercurial personality who is considered a criminal by some people and a hero by others, is fraught with political complications.   While WikiLeaks has often been criticized for releasing sensitive data without regard for the consequences, Mr. Assange is acting responsibly this time, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. WikiLeaks redacted the actual computer code for C.I.A. exploits from its initial release to avoid spreading such cyberweapons.   ''He is trying to do the right thing,'' Ms. Granick said.   She said that the legal risk to companies using the leaked information to fix their products is minimal, but that the government could make it easy by sharing more information about the vulnerabilities directly with the companies.   Paul Kocher, a cryptographer who was previously an executive at the chip company Rambus, said that helping companies patch security holes was accepted practice in the industry.   ''There are lots of things at WikiLeaks that are ethically questionable,'' Mr. Kocher said. ''But the normal thing to do if you come across vulnerabilities, regardless of who's using them, is to help them get fixed.''

An agenda for South Korea's new leader,"Robert E. Kelly is an associate professor of political science at Pusan National University. PUSAN, South Korea -- South Koreans elected Moon Jae-in as their new president on Tuesday against a backdrop of heightened United States-North Korean tensions. Yet North Korea did not dominate the campaign. South Korean voters were focused on the economy, corruption and other domestic issues like air quality. Before the voting, only 23 percent of voters said that international security was the most important issue to them. Mr. Moon, a center-left human rights lawyer who will take office as soon as this week following the ouster of former President Park Geun-hye in a corruption scandal, is a dove inclined to start negotiations with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. His candidacy was most likely bolstered by President Trump's tough talk against the North Korean regime, which is widely seen here as dangerous bluster.     South Korean equanimity toward the North's threats surprises Westerners, but the South Koreans have lived for decades with Pyongyang's provocations and, more recently, the nuclear program. Young South Koreans increasingly consider the North Korean menace a fact of life. South Korea's vulnerability to a devastating attack from the North -- Seoul's northernmost suburbs begin just 20 miles from the demilitarized zone -- adds to the sense here that the South should do everything it can to avoid war.   An overture from the incoming Moon administration to start talks with Pyongyang should be made with caution. Engagement with North Korea has a mixed, if not poor, record, and new talks would be more effective if started from a position of strength. It is vital that Mr. Moon pursue policies to decrease his country's vulnerability to attack, while dangling the possibility of talks. Beijing and Washington are key to any deal with North Korea, but Seoul can do a lot on its own.   South Korea spends only 2.6 percent of its gross domestic product on defense. To strengthen Seoul's negotiating position, Mr. Moon could indicate he will spend more on military preparedness. Civil defense (preparation of the civilian population for North Korean urban strikes), improved pay for conscripts, more intelligence, homegrown missile defense and stronger cyberdefense would help make up for Seoul's military vulnerabilities.   South Korea and Japan could work together much more to show a united front. Such coordination is undercut by persistent tension over the history of Japanese colonialism in Korea. South Korea's historical concerns with Japan have legitimate roots, but there is too much exaggeration -- such as routine suggestions in the media that Japan is remilitarizing with designs on Asia -- and not enough recognition that modern Japan is a liberal democracy and a potential ally against the North.   Seoul and Tokyo should agree to avoid separate deals with the North and reject Pyongyang's efforts to play them against each other. Mr. Moon and his left-wing base are hostile to a recently signed South Korea-Japan intelligence-sharing pact, but he should consider that South Korea benefits from it more than Japan. Military cooperation in adjoining air and sea spaces would be ideal.   To further improve South Korea's position, Seoul and Washington need to persuade Beijing to reduce trade with North Korea. Pyongyang is dependent on China for resources and access to the world economy. Cutting off North Korea would slow the nuclear and missile programs, and a reduction in luxury imports would put pressure on the regime elite.   Beijing is already obligated to enforce the existing sanctions against Pyongyang but does so haphazardly because it fears a North Korean implosion. Mr. Moon should work with Beijing to reassure its anxieties over a post-North Korean order, including the possibility of United States forces on the Chinese border, which prompted Chinese intervention in the original Korean conflict in 1950.   Given Seoul's vulnerability to attack, Mr. Moon should also do much more to encourage the decentralization of the country away from the Seoul area. Fifty percent of South Korea's population lives in the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon corridor -- 26 million people in a space roughly the size of Connecticut, directly abutting the border. The South Korean presidential residence is only some 23 miles from the demilitarized zone. It is long overdue for the government to start halting Seoul's uncontrolled growth.   Previous efforts to move the capital have failed. President Roh Moo-hyun tried unsuccessfully to move it 75 miles south to Sejong City -- though some government ministries and administrative departments have relocated there since 2004, showing decentralization is possible. There are also tax and regulatory incentives in place for South Korea's conglomerates, like Samsung and Hyundai, to relocate out of Seoul, but many remain centered in, or directly adjacent to, the city.   The South Korean government already intervenes heavily in the economy. Why not do so to encourage more dispersed settlement?   South Koreans have seen it all from the boy who cried wolf to the North and know what to expect from a third iteration of the Kim dynasty. What no one knows is what Mr. Trump will tweet next. South Koreans don't know whether Mr. Trump realizes just how vulnerable their country is to attack. But despite their differences, Mr. Trump and Mr. Moon now have a chance to build on their countries' decades-long alliance.

"Apple Customer Data in China Was Sold for $7.3 Million, Police Say","To Apple's mounting problems in China, add official scrutiny over privacy. The Chinese police said this week that they had arrested 22 people suspected of selling the personal data of an unspecified number of Apple customers. The police, in Cangnan County in the eastern province of Zhejiang, said the thieves had reaped 50 million renminbi, or about $7.3 million, over an unspecified period.    Many of the details were unclear, including the identities of those involved and the severity of the breach.    In a statement on Wednesday, the Cangnan police said they found that Apple employees had illegally acquired personal data, then later in the same statement said 20 of the 22 people worked for companies that sell Apple products or are Apple contractors. The police did not disclose information about the other two people. In China, Apple's products are sold broadly, in electronics chain stores and small booths in shopping malls in addition to the company's official Apple Stores.   The Cangnan police also said the data included the names, Apple identification numbers and phone numbers of Apple users. They did not say whether passwords or financial information like credit card numbers were involved, which would suggest the thieves had access to internal Apple data and would make the breach more serious.   The arrests are part of a set of broader difficulties in China for Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif. Sales of iPhones, still a sign of middle-class aspiration in China, have slowed, according to analysts, as the public waits for new models and as Chinese manufacturers of cheaper phones step up their quality and marketing.   Apple has also faced new scrutiny from the government on other fronts. Last year its movie and book services were shut down in China.   Still, Apple may simply be caught up in a wider rising of concern over privacy in China.   Few people in China expect the country's authoritarian central government to stay out of their business. But outside of that, a growing number of Chinese people fear cybercrime and identity theft, particularly as millions of them turn to online shopping and using money electronically.   Between widespread malware campaigns and a large number of new internet users, China has become a playground for internet fraudsters. Last year, China tried 361 criminal cases involving violation of personal data, up from 176 in 2015, said Xie Yongjiang, associate director for the Institute of Internet Governance and Law at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.   ''It is very common. Every one of us can feel it,'' Mr. Xie said. ''For example, after your child is born at a hospital, someone will phone you and ask if you need baby products. When your child turns 3, someone will phone you and ask if your child would go to their nursery school. When your child reaches primary school age, someone will phone you to ask if you need training services.''   ''You have no idea who exposed your personal data,'' he added.   The problem is not new. In one incident reported in the Chinese news media just this week, an employee of a Shanghai delivery company was recently arrested on suspicion of selling clients' personal data.   Other examples abound. An apparent trove of login information leaked onto the Chinese internet was used to hack more than 20 million accounts on Alibaba's e-commerce site Taobao, according to news reports. Alibaba said that its security systems had not been breached and that it had worked with the police to quickly catch the perpetrators.   In another example, China News Service, a state-run news agency, reported late last year that login information and other personal data from accounts associated with the Chinese e-commerce site JD.com were exposed in 2013 as part of a security problem. JD.com said it had quickly fixed the issue.   The problem is not even new to Apple. Last year, 10 employees of an Apple contractor in China were also found with data from more than 80,000 users.

Daily Report: The Testing Labs of Malware,"When hackers stole $81 million from a bank in Bangladesh last year, fingers were eventually pointed at North Korea. The accusation indicated that North Korea's hackers appeared willing to go after targets -- a bank in a developing economy hardly considered a big player in international politics -- not normally associated with nation-state cyberattacks.  The breach was also evidence that if you want to try out a new attack, you don't start on Wall Street or Western Europe. Instead, you choose something in an economy without the robust defenses of, say, Citibank. As Sheera Frenkel reports, what intrigued security researchers about the attack was the penetration of an electronic banking system called Swift. It is used throughout the world to transfer billions of dollars among banks. Learning how to break into Swift could lead to a heist of billions from the global banking system.    As developing economies become more digital, they are proving to be enticing targets. Is there as much money in a bank or business in Bangladesh compared with one in London? Of course not, but there is plenty.   Compare a cyberattack to a play: Do you try out new material on Broadway, or do you work out the kinks in a smaller market before you appear before those tough New York crowds? For hackers, the answer is easy.   Programming note: The Daily Report will take a break for the Fourth of July holiday. We will return on Wednesday.     "
Climate Change and ISIS Are Seen in Poll as World's Greatest Threats,"Climate change is essentially tied with the Islamic State as the most-feared security threat across much of the world -- except in the United States, where cyberattacks are considered a greater danger than global warming, according to a Pew Research Center report released on Tuesday. Residents of 13 countries ranked climate change as the greatest threat to national security, while in 17 countries the Islamic State was considered a more immediate problem.    In the United States, however, a gaping partisan divide pushed climate change to third-most severe perceived threat, after ISIS and cyberwarfare. Just 56 percent of Americans surveyed identified global warming as the most serious threat to the country, compared to 71 percent for cyberwarfare and 74 percent for Islamic State attacks.   The American intelligence community concluded that Russia used cyberweapons to interfere with the presidential election last year, perhaps accounting for the heightened sense of threat. The Trump administration has consistently played down the dangers of a warming climate and has withdrawn the United States from the Paris accord on climate change signed by nearly 200 nations.    Jacob Poushter, Pew's senior researcher and a co-author of the study, said that in most countries terrorism and climate change were seen as the most pressing dangers. The United States was an exception, he said.   ''The stark partisan divide between those on the left and the right means there is a large portion in the United States that doesn't see climate change as a threat,'' Mr. Poushter said. ''But there's a large percentage that does, so that lowers the number.''   The survey of 41,953 people in 38 countries was conducted from February through May. Beyond the top line figures, the survey offers other insights about how people around the world view global warming.   Latin America is deeply worried about climate change   While Latin America is certainly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, its countries rarely rank among the most at risk. That unfortunate distinction tends to go to Chad, Sudan, low-lying island states and other places where poverty and civil strife meet rising seas, floods and drought. So it's not surprising, perhaps, to see so many countries in Africa put climate change at the top of their worry lists.   But 74 percent of people surveyed in seven South American and Latin American countries cite climate as their top global concern, the highest of any region surveyed.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change offers some clues, citing ''significant trends in precipitation and temperature'' across the region. Paula Caballero, global director of the climate change program at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based think tank, noted the multiple devastating floods this spring in her native Colombia.   ''In Latin America the impacts of climate change both in terms of extreme events as well as the intensity and frequency of events has really gained momentum,'' said Ms. Caballero, who formerly served as Colombia's lead United Nations negotiator on climate change.   Even in Venezuela, the only Latin American country surveyed that did not name climate change as its top concern, global warming came in just below worries about the economy. In the midst of its own political and economic crisis last month, Venezuelan leaders ratified the Paris Agreement.   Russians are among the least concerned about warming   The Russian heat wave of 2010 was made three times more likely by climate change, a  study later found. But Russians are generally apathetic about rising greenhouse gas emissions, the Pew survey confirmed. The country backed the Paris agreement on climate change but the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, did not denounce President Trump for abandoning the accord, as so many other world leaders did.   Mr. Putin's views on the subject are opaque, though. Before the Paris accords he told world leaders that global warming ''was one of the gravest challenges humanity is facing.''   Russia ranked climate change fifth among its global concerns in the Pew survey, below the Islamic State, the economy, the refugee crisis and the influence of the United States.   What do the Russians worry about even less than climate change? Cyberattacks.   American opinion on climate change is highly partisan   We have long known Americans break heavily along party lines over the causes, solutions and very existence of man-made climate change. The Pew study lays that chasm bare.   Among Americans who consider themselves left-leaning, 86 percent cite rising emissions as a dangerous threat, compared with only 31 percent on the right. That 55 percent divide is larger than the partisan split on ISIS and on the migrant crisis.   Terrorism is the biggest worry for Americans, with 74 percent putting ISIS as the top threat to the country. Close behind are cyberattacks.   Mr. Poushter noted the surveys were conducted in the spring amid national attention on the finding that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election by hacking Democrats' emails and distributing online propaganda.   Climate change is ranked third among Americans, with 56 percent of people surveyed believing it is a major threat.   Lower levels of concern about climate change were found in Poland, Russia, India, Israel Jordan, Tunisia, Turkey, Ghana, Nigeria and Venezuela.   Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication at Yale University, said the ideological split in America underscores the divisions he has witnessed in his own studies of how Americans perceive climate change.   ''Climate change is in many ways a small skirmish in the midst of a much larger political struggle that's been going on in this country since its founding,'' he said. ''What's the relationship between government and a society of free individuals? That's playing out across the board on a lot of other issues, from tax policy to health care.''   Coal importers and exporters have divergent views   Pew did not survey many of the top oil exporters other than Russia, so it's hard to know how people feel in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates or Kuwait. But among the world's biggest coal exporters the story is a fairly nuanced one.   Citizens of Indonesia, a top coal exporter in 2014, according to the World Coal Association, listed ISIS as their highest concern. Attacks in Jakarta this spring  have set people on edge, and the country's military chief has warned that the Islamic State group has so-called sleeper cells all over the country. But climate is still seen as the third biggest threat, after the economy. Australia, also a coal-exporting giant, cited climate change as the second greatest threat after ISIS.   And among the big coal importers? Only 47 percent of people in India surveyed named climate change as a top concern, but that was enough to put the issue second after ISIS. In South Korea, 79 percent of people are worried about the climate.   Mr. Poushter said Pew did not survey China this year because of a law restricting research by foreign organizations. But a similar survey Pew conducted in 2015 found 19 percent of Chinese people polled considered themselves ''very concerned'' about climate change. That is low, particularly compared with the 79 percent of Indians who were very concerned about warming at the time.

How to Prevent a Cyberwar,"Jared Cohen is the chief executive of the Jigsaw technology incubator, a subsidiary of Alphabet, and an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. While the specifics of Russia's interference in the 2016 American election remain unclear, no one doubts that Moscow has built a robust technological arsenal for waging cyberattacks. And as tensions between the two countries rise, there's a good chance President Vladimir Putin will consider using them against American interests -- if he hasn't already. A cyberwar could quickly become a real war, with real weapons and casualties. And yet for all the destructive potential of cyberwarfare, there are precious few norms regarding how such conflict should be conducted -- or better yet, avoided.     Cyberweapons won't go away and their spread can't be controlled. Instead, as we've done for other destructive technologies, the world needs to establish a set of principles to determine the proper conduct of governments regarding cyberconflict. They would dictate how to properly attribute cyberattacks, so that we know with confidence who is responsible, and they would guide how countries should respond.   Perhaps most important, world leaders should create a framework of incentives and sanctions that encourage governments to stop destructive cyberattacks in the first place.   Ideally, these principles would be enforced through a multilateral treaty, but given the disorder of the international system and the fact that countries don't have a monopoly on the tools of cyberwar, such an approach seems unrealistic in the near future. But we can still take meaningful steps toward smaller, more tangible goals.   We could begin by working through the existing global security framework. NATO allies, for example, could collaborate by sharing forensic intelligence from cyberattacks and building better detection and response techniques.   Separately, countries could create international working groups to discuss how to react to attacks and what to do in the days or weeks before we know where they came from.   It's unrealistic to expect that any single country will unilaterally disarm its cyberarsenals while the threats remains. But governments could begin to discuss what constitutes a reasonable response when one state is attacked by another in cyberspace.   Otherwise, it's only a matter of time before a nation under cyberattack responds by bombing the likely culprit even before the evidence is conclusive.   The United States is uniquely positioned to lead this effort and point the world toward a goal of an enforceable cyberwarfare treaty. Many of the institutions that would be instrumental in informing these principles are based in the United States, including research universities and the technology industry. Part of this effort would involve leading by example, and the United States can and should establish itself as a defender of a free and open internet everywhere.   The process needs to be transparent; an effective framework to govern international behavior cannot be created or administered in secret. Since most cyberwar is conducted covertly, governments avoid any public acknowledgment of their own abilities and shy away from engaging in any sort of ''cyberdiplomacy.'' Statecraft conducted in secret fails to create public norms for deterrence.   The challenge of organizing such an effort in this fraught, unstable international system might seem daunting. Cyberweapons have already been used by governments to interfere with elections, steal billions of dollars, harm critical infrastructure, censor the press, manipulate public conversations about crucial issues and harass dissidents and journalists. The intensity of cyberconflict around the world is increasing, and the tools are becoming cheaper and more readily available.   The cost of inaction is severe. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the outbreak of World War I, ''The Guns of August,'' Barbara Tuchman describes how a single catastrophic event -- the assassination of the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne -- led to a chain reaction that ignited a global conflict. The assassination was the catalyst, but the ingredients for the chain reaction, in the form of complex military and diplomatic entanglements, had been in place for some time. True, it's an imperfect analogy in a world that seems to be disentangling more by the day, but it highlights the perils of escalation when powerful countries confront new threats.   We could soon be faced with a similar moment involving cyberwar. A broad international commitment might be the only thing that can prevent the next cyberwar from becoming the next Great War. If we don't improve our preparedness to meet the challenges of our multidimensional world, we risk proceeding so far down a path of escalation that conflict becomes inevitable.

Ploy Was Not a One-Off,"The intelligence agencies' report on the Russian intervention in the American presidential election portrays it as just one piece of an old-fashioned Soviet-style propaganda campaign. But it was a campaign made enormously more powerful by the tools of the cyberage: private emails pilfered by hackers, an internet that reaches into most American homes, social media to promote its revelations and smear enemies. What most Americans may have seen as a one-time effort -- brazen meddling by Russia in the very core of American democracy -- was, the report says, only part of a long-running information war that involves not just shadowy hackers and pop-up websites, but also more conventional news outlets, including the thriving Russian television network RT. The election intervention to damage Hillary Clinton and lift Donald J. Trump was the latest fusillade in a campaign that has gone on under the radar for years.     For the three agencies that produced the report -- the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency -- this is a heart-stopping moment: They have just told their new boss that he was elected with the vigorous, multifaceted help of an adversary, the thuggish autocrat who rules Russia.   ''Putin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,'' the report says, in unusually blunt and sweeping language.   Perhaps most arresting is the assessment that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, sees the election attack as payback -- not offense, but defense. He has borne a serious grudge against Mrs. Clinton, who he believes denigrated him when she was secretary of state and encouraged the pro-democracy protests in Moscow that erupted against him in 2011.   Mr. Putin, the report says, sees the hidden hand of the United States in the leaking of the Panama Papers, files stolen from a law firm that exposed the wealth of his closest associates, secreted in offshore accounts. He even blames the United States for the exposure -- carried out mainly by international sports authorities -- of Russian athletes for their widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs.   ''From the Russian perspective, this is punching back,'' said Christopher Porter, a former C.I.A. officer who now studies cyberattacks at the firm FireEye. ''We may not think that's fair or justified, but that's the way they see it.''   Mr. Porter said Mr. Putin had made no secret of his view that the United States, by promoting democracy in countries like Ukraine and Georgia, had interfered in Russia's backyard and was trying to undermine its power.   What is missing from the public report is what many Americans most eagerly anticipated: hard evidence to back up the agencies' claims that the Russian government engineered the election attack. That is a significant omission: Mr. Trump has been expressing skepticism for months that Russia was to blame, variously wondering whether it might have been China, or a 400-pound guy, or a guy from New Jersey.   There is only a whisper of dissent in the report -- the eavesdroppers of the N.S.A. believe with only ''moderate confidence'' that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump, while their colleagues at the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. have ''high confidence.''   While most of Congress and much of the public appears to accept the agencies' findings, Mr. Trump's prominent doubts, accompanied at times by scorn for the agencies' competence, has rallied a diverse array of skeptics on the right and the left. Under the circumstances, many in Washington expected the agencies to make a strong public case to erase any uncertainty.   Instead, the message from the agencies essentially amounts to ''trust us.'' There is no discussion of the forensics used to recognize the handiwork of known hacking groups, no mention of intercepted communications between the Kremlin and the hackers, no hint of spies reporting from inside Moscow's propaganda machinery.   At the top of every page of the report is a disclaimer that acknowledges what is missing: ''This report is a declassified version of a highly classified assessment; its conclusions are identical to those in the highly classified assessment, but this version does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign.''   It offers an obvious reason for leaving out the details, declaring that including ''the precise bases for its assessments'' would ''reveal sensitive sources or methods and imperil the ability to collect critical foreign intelligence in the future.''   The absence of any proof is especially surprising in light of promises on Thursday from the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., that he would ''push the envelope'' to try to make more information public. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Obama had directed officials to ''make as much of it public as they possibly can.''   That will not be enough for many, as the initial reaction showed. While some welcomed the scope of the report, many others were disappointed.   ''This is big: CIA, NSA & FBI publish perhaps the most high-profile intelligence community assessment in US history,'' Thomas Rid, a professor at King's College London and an expert on cyberwarfare, wrote on Twitter.   But Susan Hennessey, a former intelligence agency lawyer who is now the managing editor of the online journal Lawfare, wrote: ''The unclassified report is underwhelming at best. There is essentially no new information for those who have been paying attention.''   Though the unclassified report is 25 pages long, counting the covers and several blank pages, the core analysis runs just five pages. That is less than the seven-page ''annex'' devoted to RT America, the television network. It is a description of the broadcaster from an intelligence report written in 2012, years before the election-related hacking took place.   The agencies ''have taken an all-source look at the broader Russian strategy,'' said Mr. Porter, the former C.I.A. officer. The detailed description of RT's tactics, though years old, he added, was included because they fit that strategy.   Mr. Trump may have been persuaded by his classified briefing on Friday on the Russian attack, which included everything that the unclassified report leaves out, even if the statement he issued afterward seemed lukewarm. But this report is unlikely to change the minds of skeptics who, like the president-elect, remember the intelligence agencies' faulty assessments on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and fear being misled again.

U.S. Says Russians Were Behind Cyberattacks on Antidoping Agency,"United States intelligence officials have determined that last year's cyberattacks on the World Anti-Doping Agency originated with the Russian government, perpetrated in apparent retaliation for what President Vladimir V. Putin deemed to be an American-led effort to defame Russia for widespread doping.  That conclusion was published Friday in a declassified intelligence report ordered by President Obama. The report centered on Russia's efforts to affect the 2016 American presidential election at Mr. Putin's direction, while also referring to Russia's related ""influence efforts against targets such as Olympic athletes and other foreign governments."" ""A prominent target since the 2016 Summer Olympics has been the World Anti-Doping Agency,"" the report said. WADA, the global regulator of drugs in sports, commissioned numerous investigations into systematic Russian doping last year. In July, the agency recommended that Russia be barred from the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro for its state-sponsored doping program, which persisted for years and spanned disciplines. Weeks later, the regulator discovered that its database containing the private medical information of international athletes had been breached. A group identifying itself as Fancy Bear - a Russian cyberespionage group that forensics experts had tied to the Russian government - published the records of athletes who had received special clearance to take typically banned substances for medical reasons. In Friday's report, American intelligence officials concluded that the Fancy Bear hacking had originated with Russia's main military intelligence unit, the G.R.U., which had also begun working to influence the American election in March. Many of the records stolen from the doping regulator related to American athletes, including Simone Biles, the gymnast who won numerous medals in Rio, and the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. The release of the records was an apparent attempt to discredit the athletes and paint the United States as hypocritical, Friday's report stated. On Friday, Catherine MacLean, a spokeswoman for the antidoping agency, pointed to the organization's statement in September condemning the criminal activity and noted that the agency had ""asked the Russian government to do everything in their power to make it stop."" Russian news media and sports officials have repeatedly invoked the stolen records in recent months, arguing that they are evidence of legalized doping and what they perceive to be the preferential treatment of Western athletes. Regulators and Olympic officials have repeatedly defended the affected athletes, noting that they followed proper procedure and received formal clearance. ""Russia never had the opportunities that were given to other countries,"" Vitaly Smirnov, a former top Russian sports official appointed by Mr. Putin to reform the nation's antidoping system, said last month, referring to the hacked records as evidence. ""The general feeling in Russia is that we didn't have a chance.""  "
Trump Calls for Closer Relationship Between U.S. and Russia,"WASHINGTON - A day after the release of a damning intelligence report on Russia's wide-ranging efforts to influence the American election, President-elect Donald J. Trump called on Saturday for a closer relationship between the two nations, saying only ""stupid"" people or ""fools"" would think this was unwise.  The United States, Mr. Trump wrote in a series of Twitter messages Saturday morning, has ""enough problems around the world without yet another one."" He pledged that Russia would ""respect us far more than they do now"" after he is sworn in as president, and said that the two nations could perhaps work together on the international stage. For years, Russia has been anything but a willing partner of the United States. Relations became strained well before the election-related cyberattacks began nearly a year and a half ago, despite the Obama administration's early effort to reset relations. After Russia's intrusion into Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea in 2014, the United States and its allies levied broad sanctions against the Russian economy and blacklisted dozens of its citizens, including some close to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. President Obama added to those measures last month in retaliation for the hacking, expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States and imposing sanctions on two Russian intelligence services. Russia and the United States have also often been at odds over Moscow's involvement in the war in Syria. Senior intelligence officials briefed Mr. Trump on their findings on Russian election interference on Friday, before releasing a declassified report that concluded that Mr. Putin had ""ordered"" a sprawling campaign intended to denigrate Hillary Clinton and aid Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence agencies' conclusions as politically motivated, but he appeared to soften that stance in a statement his transition team released after the briefing. He also seemingly conceded Russian involvement in the election, but he has taken pains to point out that there is no evidence that any vote tallies were altered, apparently seeking to avoid the suggestion that his victory was illegitimate. Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that it is time to ""move on"" from the focus on Russian meddling in the election, arguing that it has received such attention only because Democrats are embarrassed about their loss - an assertion he repeated on Twitter on Saturday. Late on Friday, he blamed the Democratic National Committee for the hacking of its computer systems, saying that ""gross negligence"" had allowed it to happen. Many Democrats saidon Twitter that Mr. Trump was essentially engaging in victim-blaming.  "
Russia's D.N.C. Hack Was Only the Start; Op-Ed Contributor,"Imagine the headlines if, in 2015, Russian agents had leapt out of a van at 2 a.m. in Southeast Washington and broken into the Democratic National Committee offices using sophisticated tools and techniques to steal tens of thousands of documents, including the names and Social Security numbers of donors and employees, and confidential memorandums about campaign strategy for the presidential election. The world would have been aghast. It would have been, people would say, worse than Watergate.  Something similar did, in fact, happen at the D.N.C. two years ago, and it was worse than Watergate. This wasn't just one party spying on the other; these were hackers under orders from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia who were trying to ""undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process,"" according to a report released Friday by the office of the director of national intelligence. But the immediate reaction to the break-in was nothing like what followed Watergate. That's because most of us don't think of hacking as a crime like breaking and entering. Before the D.N.C. break-in, I thought of hacking as a prank by mischievous tech-savvy people to get revenge. When North Koreans hacked Sony Picturesin 2014 in retaliation for making the satire ""The Interview,"" I was much more disturbed by the embarrassing things the movie executives said in emails to one another than by how easy it was for a dictator to punish critics in the United States. It wasn't until I lived through the Russian hackings of Democratic staff members and organizations that I realized how dangerous such an attitude could be. I saw it firsthand in July, when I was asked about the first wave of stolen documents on ABC's ""This Week"" and CNN's ""State of the Union."" I thought it was a bombshell - Russians hacked into the Democratic National Committee! - but my alarm was dismissed by the news media and our opponents as merely campaign spin, feigned distress meant to dodge real questions about how the embarrassing messages might hurt Hillary Clinton's prospects. This perception has to change. I'm not referring to the D.N.C. incident in particular, but about cybercrimes in general. Unless we realize how vulnerable we are, we are playing into the hands of foreign aggressors like Mr. Putin. The chilling effect of these attacks can be very public, and very personal. But they can also be more subtle, impeding dialogue within an organization. For all the fanfare we give the internet for freeing speech, when it is weaponized against you, it can also be used to stifle speech. At the D.N.C., certain conversations could take place only on an encrypted phone app, which made communicating more complicated logistically. Skeptics, including President-elect Donald J. Trump, have compared the hacks to leaks to the news media. They're not the same. A leak occurs when someone who is authorized to have information gives it to a reporter without authorization. The ""Access Hollywood"" video of Mr. Trump talking about assaulting women was a leak. When someone on my staff shared a memo about our campaign launch without permission, that was a leak. Leaks are frustrating, and they happen all the time. What Mr. Putin did by dumping Democrats' emails wasn't a leak; it was an attack with stolen information. Until we start to see these situations in this light, ""Moscow's longstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order,"" as the national intelligence office report called it, will remain potent, and the democratic process will remain vulnerable. The news media needs to spend at least as much time reporting on the source of these foreign-led cybercrimes as they do on the contents. This isn't a partisan issue, as Republican senators like John McCainand LindseyGrahamhave already made clear. Mr. Putin and Kim Jong-un of North Korea aren't registered Democrats or Republicans - they're anti-American, and they want to hurt democracy itself. To justify what Mr. Putin did, or to blame the victim, as Mr.Trump and his staff have chosen to do, simply leaves them, and all of us, under threat, because the next attack may be aimed not at a political party, but at the White House or the Pentagon. Of course, Americans need to do a better job protecting ourselves. Law enforcement needs to create better bridges between the intelligence services that monitor attacks and the individuals and organizations they affect. There are very few protocols for the F.B.I. and C.I.A. to alert and assist potential victims. Our democratic structures - elections equipment and officials, elected officials and candidates, activists and reporters - must be elevated as a priority. At the time of the D.N.C. attack, water treatment plants, nuclear power plants and even casinos were on the Department of Homeland Security's ""critical infrastructure"" list. Voting equipment was added last Friday, but we must do much more to protect the people who animate our democratic process. Imagine how stolen information could be (or already has been) used to influence or corrupt officeholders, or voters themselves. Watergate inspired greater vigilance in the press and prompted major reforms to safeguard our democratic institutions. We need to do that again.

Donald Trump Concedes Russia's Interference in Election,"President-elect Donald J. Trump on Wednesday conceded for the first time that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against the two major political parties during the presidential election, but he angrily rejected unsubstantiated reports that Moscow had gathered compromising personal and financial information about him that could be used for extortion. In a chaotic news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan nine days before he is to be sworn in as the nation's 45th president, Mr. Trump compared United States intelligence officials to Nazis, sidestepped repeated questions about whether he or anyone in his presidential campaign had had contact with Russia during the campaign, and lashed out at the news media and political opponents, arguing that they were out to get him. ""As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,"" Mr. Trump said, his first comments accepting the conclusions of United States intelligence officials that Moscow had interfered in the election to help him win. But the president-elect expressed little outrage about that breach and seemed to cast doubt on Russia's role moments after acknowledging it, asserting that ""it could have been others also.""  He also quoted a Kremlin denial Tuesday night of reports that it had gathered damaging information to compromise Mr. Trump. ""They said it totally never happened,"" Mr. Trump said of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his government. ""I respected the fact that he said that."" The news conference displayed the showmanship, combativeness and sensitivity to criticism that Mr. Trump exhibited throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and underscored his reflex to rebut any criticism or question about his conduct. In his maligning of the nation's intelligence agencies, journalists and Hillary Clinton, the president-elect indicated that he would conduct himself the same way in the White House. Using the same boastful tone that characterized his campaign rallies, Mr. Trump asserted that his victory in November had vindicated his view that he should not release his tax returns, an issue that he said only the news media cared about, not the public. ""I won,"" he said. ""I don't think they care at all."" In a Pew Research Center poll this month, 60 percent of respondents said Mr. Trump should release his returns, although just 38 percent of Republican respondents said he should. Some moments bordered on bizarre for the next president of the United States. Mr. Trump spoke of his awareness as a businessman that there were hidden cameras in hotel rooms in Moscow and other foreign capitals. He called himself ""very much of a germaphobe,"" apparently in an effort to discredit unsubstantiated claims about sex videos with Mr. Trump and prostitutes in a Russian hotel. ""Does anyone really believe that story?"" he said, calling it ""phony stuff"" that ""never happened."" At one point, Mr. Trump got into a confrontation with a correspondent for CNN, which was among the first to report on the allegations, saying to him, ""You are fake news."" Moments later, though, Mr. Trump called on another CNN correspondent. A person who identified himself as a correspondent for RT, the Russian English-language news organization that American intelligence agencies deem a Russian propaganda tool, shouted repeatedly in vain attempts to draw Mr. Trump's attention. Mr. Trump voiced only faint concern about what United States intelligence officials said was a campaign by Mr. Putin to meddle in American democracy. He reserved his sharpest condemnation for American intelligence officials who he said had failed to keep secret the accusations that could be damaging to him. On Wednesday, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., said he had spoken with Mr. Trump that evening and expressed his ""profound dismay"" over the leaks of unsubstantiated information. He said he had emphasized that this information was ""not a U.S. intelligence community product"" and that the intelligence agencies had not determined that it was reliable. He said he did not believe that the leaks had come from the intelligence agencies. The president-elect, asked at the news conference whether he believed that Mr. Putin had directed the hacking effort to help him win the presidency, said, ""If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia."" ""He shouldn't be doing it,"" Mr. Trump said later of the Russian president. ""He won't be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I'm leading than when other people have led it."" Of the intelligence officials who will soon serve him, Mr. Trump said: ""I think it was disgraceful - disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. That's something that Nazi Germany would have done, and did do."" He did not address whether the sanctions President Obama imposed on Moscow for the cyberattacks should stay or be strengthened as some Republicans have urged, especially as the scope of the hacking has become clearer. The hourlong news conference - Mr. Trump's first in nearly six months - touched not only on reports of espionage and attempted blackmail, but also on potential conflicts of interest with Mr. Trump's vast business empire and questions about domestic policy. The glut of pent-up questions for the president-elect gave him an advantage in navigating the exchange; he interrupted inquiries about Russia's hacking to introduce a lawyer, Sheri L. Dillon, who spoke at length about how Mr. Trump would organize his business affairs and explain why he was not divesting from his global business empire. ""President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built,"" Ms. Dillon said. Mr. Trump offered glimpses of his plans for his first days in office, including pledging to choose a Supreme Court nominee within two weeks of Inauguration Day to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia and to invite journalists to watch a series of ""signings"" at the White House, an apparent allusion to the several executive orders he has promised to sign to roll back major pieces of Mr. Obama's agenda. Calling himself ""the greatest job-producer that God ever created,"" Mr. Trump pledged to continue leaning on American companies to keep jobs in the United States. He took particular aim at the pharmaceutical industry, which he said ""has been disastrous"" and had been ""getting away with murder"" on drug pricing. Taking on a powerful lobby that Republicans have long defended, Mr. Trump said he wanted the federal government to use its purchasing power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare and Medicaid - a proposal long favored by Democrats. But he broke starkly with Democrats over the Affordable Care Act as he repeated a promise to submit a plan to repeal and replace the law ""essentially simultaneously,"" as soon as Representative Tom Price, his choice to be secretary of health and human services, is confirmed. ""Obamacare is the Democrats' problem,"" Mr. Trump said Wednesday. ""We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service."" He also insisted, despite repeated denials by Mexican officials, that Mexico would pay to build a wall on the southern border of the United States to block foreigners from entering illegally. Mr. Trump said Vice President-elect Mike Pence was working with federal agencies to begin construction quickly, and asserted that Mexico would ultimately reimburse the cost through a tax or other payment. Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto, reiterated Wednesday that his country would not pay for the wall, but said it would invest in more border security. In front of Mr. Trump was a table stacked with manila folders that he said contained paperwork for a portion of the companies being put into a trust to be controlled and run by his eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and a trustee. They stood to his side along with his daughter Ivanka Trump, who also announced on Wednesday that she would sever ties with the Trump Organization and her own company. Closing the news conference, Mr. Trump even got in a veiled plug for his former reality show, ""The Apprentice"" - he remains an executive producer of the current version, ""Celebrity Apprentice"" - by saying that if his sons did not manage his empire well while he served as president, he would tell them, ""You're fired.""

An Evolving Darwin,"Deep into the night, 15 computer whizzes toiled feverishly on Charles Darwin's groundbreaking research notes at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. As part of the Darwin Manuscripts Project, the team had a daunting mission: piecing together fragments of the renowned British naturalist's handwritten work. Recalling the 24-hour session last November, the self-described hackers -- some from big companies like Google and eBay -- described sitting at a long table in a fossil hall under the tail of a cast of a 122-foot-long titanosaur. They ate brownies, drank lots of coffee and caught brief naps on nearby cots. A buzz was in the air.     ''We love cool problem-solving under the dinosaur tail,'' said Jin Chung, a software engineer at eBay. ''You're looking at a piece of history. We're even touching the Darwin artifacts themselves.''   Their group effort was part of the museum's Hack the Stacks program, which uses tech-driven solutions to solve age-old problems. The 15 hackers worked from 25,540 digitized and mostly transcribed images of Darwin's loose notes -- some consisting of only one sentence -- that he had torn or cut apart to form the raw material for his theory of evolution in ''On the Origin of Species.''   Instantly explosive when it was published in 1859, the book is still viewed as the keystone of evolutionary biology. Legions of scientists remain devoted to its text and to the observations that went into its preparation.   Against this backdrop, the manuscripts project is reassembling Darwin's notes as he originally wrote them. To speed the process, the computer experts use superfast computers to match up the rough edges of the disassembled notes, many in nearly undecipherable handwriting.   ''The fragments are hard by eye to unite because they're all over the place,'' said David Kohn, 76, a Darwin scholar who oversees the museum's program. ''But we had fun putting together what we could.''   A chronic reorganizer, Darwin arranged his notes according to topics that interested him at the time. One page, for example, might be observations made about bees visiting flowers in 1840, originally placed in a portfolio on the behavior of bees. Perhaps 10 years later, he tore or cut that page, moving some of the observations into a portfolio on the pollination of flowers. By reassembling the original pages, researchers hope to understand fully the long arc of Darwin's research and the gradual maturation of his thinking.   Before the manuscripts project began 10 years ago, Dr. Kohn tried to crack the code of Darwin's handwriting. He would sit for hours at the Cambridge University Library, where the original manuscripts are stored, and focus on the slopes and curves of the botanist's scrawl. In 2007, a five-person team embarked on the task of transcribing thousands of pages of Darwin's scientific papers, drawings and book research.   Working from the transcriptions, the computer experts then began trying to reassemble the manuscripts digitally. Their work will accomplish in months what would take years to do by hand.   Darwin, an experimenter extraordinaire, might have appreciated the efforts.   A wealthy landowner, he used Down House, his property of 20 acres or so in England, for hands-on testing of his theories. His laboratory included five greenhouses and a vegetable garden, and his initial experiments consisted of observing 1,000 flowering plants over three summers in the gardens on his relatives' grounds.   Darwin also enlisted some of his 10 children to gather flowers or collect moths at night. They even drew enchanting pictures of flowers on the backs of his notes. Darwin himself ''was a terrible drawer,'' Dr. Kohn said.   ''I was, however, surprised at the depth of involvement with his family,'' he added. ''Darwin had a network to gather and test his theories.''   During the 24-hour hackathon, Dr. Kohn inspired the computer experts with some of these stories about Darwin's exploits in experimentation. For example, Darwin would put vegetable or flower seeds in little bottles with salt water to see how long they could float. That way, he could test his theories about how far seeds could travel and survive.   To sort through the notes, the computer experts used coding and image processing to differentiate pages with ragged, fuzzy or sharp edges. Then they matched curves by performing a shape analysis. The project is expected to be completed by the end of March.   Luis Ibanez, a software engineer from Google who helped with image-processing functions, found out about the manuscripts project at his company, which promoted it internally. He said he had taken part in 15 hackathons for various projects and enjoys picking up ''new tricks'' from other hackers.   Mr. Ibanez was especially impressed that Darwin was able to experiment at his own pace over the decades. ''We couldn't do that at Google,'' he said.   For her analysis of the manuscripts, Ms. Chung applied tools like the Fourier transform, which breaks wave forms into alternate representations. ''I got more exposure to image-processing tools during the hackathon,'' she said.   Data from the project is being uploaded onto GitHub, the open-source software-sharing library, and is publicly accessible.   Dr. Kohn suggested that Darwin would be tickled with the new technology tools.   The naturalist kept up his research until the day he died in 1882. His manuscripts were stored in steel trunks that remained in a son's house until the 1940s, when they were transferred to the Cambridge University Library. In the 1950s, they were finally cataloged, prompting a cottage industry of historical research, Dr. Kohn said.   With the notes newly assembled digitally, Darwin's work can now move into the 21st century.     "
"A Tweet Causes a Seizure, and a Suspect Is Charged With Cyberstalking","WASHINGTON -- When the journalist Kurt Eichenwald opened an animated image sent to him on Twitter in December, the message ''You deserve a seizure for your posts'' appeared in capital letters along with a blinding strobe light. Mr. Eichenwald, who has epilepsy, immediately suffered a seizure. On Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had arrested John Rayne Rivello, 29, at his home in Salisbury, Md., and accused him of sending the electronic file. The agency charged Mr. Rivello with criminal cyberstalking with the intent to kill or cause bodily harm.     The charge could carry a prison sentence of up to 10 years, according to the United States district attorney in Dallas, who is prosecuting the case.   The unusual case has shown how online tools can be deployed as weapons capable of physical harm. The F.B.I. and the Dallas police led the investigation into Mr. Rivello, and the police said he sent the strobe light knowing that it was likely to lead Mr. Eichenwald, who has publicly discussed his epilepsy, into a seizure.   Steven Lieberman, Mr. Eichenwald's lawyer, has argued that the use of the strobe light in a GIF, or moving graphic, was akin to sending an explosive or poison in the mail.   ''This electronic message was no different than a bomb sent in the mail or anthrax sent in an envelope,'' said Mr. Lieberman, who is working on the case as a pro bono service. ''It triggers a physical effect.'' (Mr. Lieberman represents The New York Times as outside counsel, and Mr. Eichenwald was a reporter for The Times from 1986 to 2006.)   That comparison makes Mr. Eichenwald's case different from other claims of harmful attacks using social media. Lawsuits involving stalking and bullying on the internet have focused on how online content, such as disparaging and abusive messages and pictures, can harm victims emotionally and even increase the risk of suicide. But with this case, Mr. Rivello is said to have designed the attack specifically around the victim's medical condition.   ''This is an interesting and unique case in that there are lots of online attacks that can have physical consequences, such as an attack on an electrical grid or the control of air traffic control,'' said Vivek Krishnamurthy, an assistant director at the Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard Law School. ''But this is distinguishable because it is a targeted physical attack that was personal, using a plain-Jane tool.''   Investigators found evidence of the plan to attack Mr. Eichenwald from a search of Mr. Rivello's Twitter account, the Justice Department said in a statement. After obtaining a search warrant for Mr. Rivello's social media account, investigators found direct messages to other Twitter users about Mr. Eichenwald, including one that read, ''I hope this sends him into a seizure.''   Other Twitter messages from Mr. Rivello included one that read, ''I know he has epilepsy.''   Investigators also searched one of Mr. Rivello's digital accounts and found a screenshot of Mr. Eichenwald's Wikipedia page that had been altered to show a fake date of death of Dec. 16, 2016, the day after the strobe light attack, the Justice Department said. The digital account also contained screenshots from epilepsy.com with a list of commonly reported epilepsy seizure triggers.   The attack drew attention from the news media as thousands of Twitter users witnessed the sequence of events unfold live on the social media site.   Mr. Eichenwald, 55, who has about 318,000 followers on Twitter and has written four books, including ''The Informant,'' had been critical of Donald J. Trump throughout his presidential campaign. Mr. Eichenwald suspected that the attacker, who operated under the pseudonym ''@jew_goldstein'' on Twitter, was a supporter of Mr. Trump. Twitter has since suspended the account.   Late in the evening on Dec. 15, Mr. Eichenwald went to his home office in Dallas and saw that @jew_goldstein had replied to a Twitter post with a GIF. When Mr. Eichenwald clicked on the file, the strobe light triggered the seizure, his lawyer said. Mr. Eichenwald fell to the ground.   His wife, Theresa, found him on the floor and saw the Twitter post on his computer screen. She called 911 and then replied on Twitter: ''@jew_goldstein This is his wife, you caused a seizure. I have your information and have called the police to report the assault.''   Mr. Eichenwald was incapacitated for several days, lost feeling in his left hand and had trouble speaking for several weeks, according to his lawyer.   Soon after, he contacted the Dallas district attorney's office. In state court, Mr. Eichenwald's lawyer filed for permission to serve a subpoena of Twitter to gain access to the account for @jew_goldstein. The social media company indicated it would cooperate, which drew protest from an anonymous ''John Doe'' filing that was intended to quash the subpoena.   Investigators would not say how they tracked down Mr. Rivello. Court documents were not immediately available. Mr. Rivello will be transferred to Dallas, where Mr. Eichenwald lives, to appear before the District Court for the Northern District of Texas.   Mr. Eichenwald used Twitter on Friday to thank officials for their work on his case. He said that since the Dec. 15 message, 40 more accounts have sent him strobe light images.   ''Details of their cases are with the FBI. Stop sending them,'' he wrote on Twitter.   Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang.     "
Tech Roundup: Portrait of a Russian Hacker,"A day after federal officials indicted four men -- two of whom were Russian intelligence agents -- on charges they hacked into the internet company Yahoo and breached 500 million customer accounts, a portrait emerged of one of the suspects.  Dmitry A. Dokuchaev, a Russian intelligence officer who was one of the two agents who allegedly directed the Yahoo attack, was once known by the hacker nickname Forb and had specialized in purloining credit card numbers, writes Andrew E. Kramer, a Moscow correspondent for The New York Times.    Mr. Dokuchaev, 33, was a hacker-turned-agent who has been in and out of legal trouble -- and his latest indictment may be the least of his worries. While American officials have claimed that Mr. Dokuchaev hacked Yahoo to help the Russian government, Russian authorities have accused him of being a double agent for the United States. He was arrested four months ago in Russia on charges of treason.   No matter how these cases are resolved, Mr. Dokuchaev would seem to face a future that is not exactly bright.   ''He's a guy without many options,'' Pavel Vrublevsky, a computer entrepreneur and owner of an online payment processing company in Russia who was investigated by Mr. Dokuchaev, told The Times.

Hollywood Studios Choose Former U.S. Ambassador as Next Top Lobbyist,"LOS ANGELES -- Christopher J. Dodd, ending an uneven six-year tenure, will step down in September as chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America and will be succeeded as Hollywood's top lobbyist by Charles H. Rivkin, a former United States ambassador and assistant secretary of state. In announcing the change on Friday, the chiefs of Hollywood's six major studios lavished praise on Mr. Dodd, 72, who took over the movie organization after serving as a Democratic senator from Connecticut for three decades.     ''He helped create a fully integrated, global online antipiracy operation,'' Stacey Snider, chief executive of 20th Century Fox, said in a statement. Mr. Dodd was also credited with helping to gain distribution for Hollywood movies in China.   China is likely to be Mr. Rivkin's initial focus. The studios are working to renegotiate Chinese rules that limit how many Hollywood movies are shown in the country each year. ''If you ask these guys what their three major goals are, they will tell you China, China, China,'' Mr. Dodd said in a telephone interview, referring to studio executives.   But Mr. Dodd, who plans to stay with the association until the end of the year to help with the transition, will also be remembered for two moments when the organization faltered.   A major push in 2012 by copyright holders -- including those represented by Mr. Dodd -- for a tough federal law to control foreign online piracy collapsed in the face of stiff resistance from Google and other technology giants. Mr. Dodd had just taken over as the association's chief and had to adhere to legislation that forbade him from personally lobbying Congress for two years after leaving office, but the failure of the law, the Stop Online Piracy Act, became a black eye nonetheless.   Mr. Dodd was also faulted for his handling of a 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. As hackers exposed thousands of emails and internal documents, Sony was left unassisted for a time, with Mr. Dodd unable to persuade executives at Hollywood's other major studios to offer public support. Sony threatened to withdraw from the organization over the episode, but ultimately remained a member.   Sounding jovial and joking about no longer having to spar with the executive Harvey Weinstein over film ratings, Mr. Dodd said he was proud of his track record, particularly regarding online piracy. ''I wanted to leave the organization in a better place than I found it,'' he said, ''and I believe that is the case.''   Mr. Rivkin, 55, is a familiar face in show business. Before his government career, he ran the Jim Henson Company, the ancestral home of the Muppets. He was also the chief executive of Wildbrain Entertainment, known for producing the hit series ''Yo Gabba Gabba!'' He was named United States ambassador to France in 2009 and later became the top State Department official for business and economic affairs under President Barack Obama.   Despite his experience, Mr. Rivkin faces an arduous task at the association. The organization, which runs Hollywood's movie ratings system, has been weakened by budget cuts. All of the member studios are embedded within global media conglomerates, which employ their own lobbyists and often have competing interests. And when it comes to influence in Washington, Hollywood has been surpassed by Silicon Valley.   ''In today's digital world, the mission and function of the M.P.A.A. are more important than ever,'' Mr. Rivkin said in a statement. ''Chris has done a great job, and I'm excited to work with the member studios to continue to expand the global market for entertainment content, while ensuring creators' rights are respected around the world.''

Thailand Warns Facebook After Video Appears to Show King in a Crop Top,"HONG KONG -- Facebook came under increasing pressure from Thailand's government on Tuesday to remove dozens of pages from its servers, a few weeks after a video that appears to show the country's new king walking through a shopping mall in a crop top was widely shared on the site. The standoff is the latest sign of a clampdown on online speech by a military junta that seized power in a 2014 coup, and the latest test for Facebook, which has struggled to balance local laws and cultural expectations with its core identity as a network where people are free to share ideas and news.     It may also be a gauge of how aggressively the junta plans to enforce an existing lèse-majesté law -- which makes it a crime to insult the king, the queen or the crown prince -- under new leadership.   ''The government's moves to restrict Facebook indicate that it is solidifying ideologically around the monarchy, making it the cornerstone of its overall efforts to stem political freedom,'' said David Streckfuss, author of ''Truth on Trial in Thailand: Defamation, Treason, and Lèse-Majesté.''   ''Its main tactic will be to refashion this law, already much abused, into an offensive weapon designed to eliminate all forms of political opposition,'' he said.   Takorn Tantasith, secretary general of Thailand's National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, told reporters on Tuesday that 131 Facebook pages that were deemed to violate computer crimes or lèse-majesté laws had not yet been removed.   He said that the government had obtained a court order to block 34 of the pages and was still working on the others, and that Facebook had agreed to cooperate. He did not say which pages or what was on them.   ''We must thank Facebook for cooperating with us and complying with Thai law,'' he said.   The 44-second video that was shared in recent weeks appears to show King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 64, in a yellow crop top that exposed his tattooed back. A Facebook post in April by Somsak Jeamteerasakul, a prominent Thai historian and critic of the monarchy who lives in France, that featured the video has been viewed about 458,000 times.   Mr. Somsak's post has been blocked in Thailand, and neither the government nor Facebook has publicly said whether it was one of the 131 in question.   This month, however, Mr. Somsak published what he said was a message about the post that he had received from a Facebook spokesman who identified himself as Tim. The message said that Thailand's Digital Ministry for Economic and Social Affairs had sent the company a court order saying the post violated the Computer Crime Act.   Also this month, the domestic news media quoted the Thai Internet Service Provider Association as saying that it would be forced to shut down Facebook by Tuesday morning if the company had not removed all 131 pages. That shutdown did not occur, and the standoff was not receiving much attention on social media in the country on Tuesday.   The lèse-majesté law carries a maximum jail term of 15 years.   The king ascended to the throne in December, after the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in October after reigning for seven decades.   King Bhumibol was widely beloved by Thais who saw him as an advocate of the common people. King Vajiralongkorn, by contrast, once maintained a lavish European lifestyle full of romantic intrigue, prompting critics to question whether he is suited for the monarchy.   The video has been blocked in Thailand but was still available outside the country on Tuesday.   Facebook, which opened an office in Thailand in 2015, declined to answer questions about its operations in the country or the pages that the government wants to remove. A spokeswoman, Clare Wareing, said only that the company's policy was to comply with requests by governments to restrict access to content that officials believed violated local laws.   ''When we receive such a request, we review it to determine if it puts us on notice of unlawful content,'' Ms. Wareing said in an emailed statement. ''If we determine that it does, then we make it unavailable in the relevant country or territory and notify people who try to access it why it is restricted.''   Facebook has faced political blowback in the region for posts on its social network.   In Indonesia, for example, a proliferation of political propaganda and fake news on the site over the past year led to government calls for the company to do more to control the problem. And in Vietnam, the government demanded Facebook's help in tamping down fake accounts and other posts it said violated its laws.   In Thailand, Facebook has done its best to show respect to sensitivities around the monarchy. After King Bhumibol's death, the network completely suspended advertisements in Thailand on its site for a week.   Yet the government's new demands have presented a distinctly new challenge for the company: While it can say it is following local laws in taking down videos of the king, its actions may embolden other world leaders to expect the same treatment.   Facebook's website says that, after requests from the Thai Ministry of Information and Communication Technology, it restricted 40 pieces of content from last July to December that reportedly violated lèse-majesté laws, up from 10 in the previous six months.   Thailand's military junta, which seized power from a democratically elected government, has frequently used the 2007 Computer Crime Act to prosecute those who criticize it on social media platforms. It also passed a new version of the law in December that Human Rights Watch said would tighten the ''chokehold'' on online expression there.   In late April, Mr. Takorn of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission was quoted by The Bangkok Post as saying that internet service and gateway providers should block websites that carry illicit content and inform the government whether the sites were being encrypted abroad.   ''Despite good cooperation between the regulator and the ministry to prevent illicit content on websites over the last two years, the government hopes for more, and expects better'' results by May, he said.   Last week, the commission said it had identified about 6,900 web addresses that required blocking, including about 600 total from Google, Facebook and YouTube. Google and YouTube had removed the addresses of their own accord, the commission said, and Facebook removed 178 of the 309 Facebook pages that the government had cited, also of its own accord. But 131 other Facebook pages were encrypted, it said, so it would seek the company's help.     "
The Rise and Fall of a Messaging App,"This month, two feminist groups and several former students filed a federal complaint accusing the University of Mary Washington in Virginia and its former president, Richard Hurley, of failing to protect the female plaintiffs from cyber harassment and threats of physical and sexual violence during their time at the university. The platform where all of this took place? Yik Yak, the now-defunct, localized, anonymous messaging app that Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington, two students at Furman University in South Carolina, founded in 2013 and that soon became associated with bullying, discriminatory speech and threats of bomb and gun violence.    ''The lack of responsiveness and inability to control this devastating hate speech I think is what ultimately did this app in,'' said Debra Katz, one of the lawyers who brought the complaint against Mary Washington, located in Fredericksburg, and Mr. Hurley, in federal court for the Eastern District of Virginia.    In response to the suit, the university said it contained ''no new allegations'' and that it had, and would continue, to ''work diligently to create a safe and secure campus environment and to address the issue of sexual violence.''   There was no comment from Mr. Hurley's lawyer.   The lawsuit was just the latest twist in the rocky road the messaging app has traveled in its short life.   In March 2014, a school in Massachusetts evacuated its students twice after Yik-Yak-based bomb threats, and during the same month, a high school in California was put on lockdown for a similar reason.   In October 2014, Jordan Seman, a student at Middlebury College in Vermont, posted an open letter about being targeted on the app for her weight. ''I felt exposed, betrayed and mostly embarrassed,'' she wrote.   The next month, two other high schools in California were put on lockdown after threats of violence, and in Michigan, the police arrested Matthew Mullen, a student at Michigan State whose Yik Yak post threatened  a shooting. Mr. Mullen was eventually sentenced to two years' probation and ordered to pay $800 in restitution for the investigation.   At the University of Missouri, campus police arrested Hunter M. Park and charged him with making threats of violence against black students on Yik Yak. Mr. Park received a three-year suspended sentence and five years' probation after pleading guilty to making a terrorist threat. A former Virginia Tech student pleaded guilty to using the app to threaten a repeat of the 2007 campus shooting in which 32 people were killed.   The high point for Yik Yak came in 2014, when its founders raised $73 million in venture-capital funding. According to App Annie, a firm that tracks metrics for apps, downloads spiked in September of that year and stayed high for several months. But by early 2015, the decline began. App Annie estimates that Yik Yak had 1.8 million downloads in September 2014. By September 2016, it was 125,000.   At the end of that year, Mr. Droll and Mr. Buffington laid off 60 percent of their employees, and last month, they shut down the operation, selling off intellectual property and employee contracts to Square Inc., a mobile payment company, for $1 million. A few months earlier, Hive, a college-based chat app with a similar color scheme to Yik Yak's, popped up in the iTunes and Google Play stores, with Mr. Buffington in one of the screenshots. Whether it was an attempt at reinvention under the Yik Yak umbrella or a side project is unclear, but it is no longer available.   Yik Yak's image problems seemed to stem from its reliance on anonymous posts and the few solutions that were available to curtail racist, sexist, aggressive or threatening language. The app was community-monitored, meaning that users could vote down a post they found vulgar or offensive, and if the post received enough negative feedback, it was removed.   But the app's privacy policy did not allow institutions to identify users who posed a risk without a subpoena, court order or search warrant, or an emergency request from a law-enforcement official with a compelling claim of imminent harm.   Though neither Yik Yak nor its creators were named as defendants in the suit against Mary Washington and Mr. Hurley, the app's role was central. Its name is mentioned 51 times in the 35-page complaint, which outlines instances when members of the campus group Feminists United were targeted in ''Yaks,'' or messages on the platform, after they spoke out against Greek life on campus and were connected with the suspension of a rugby team, some of whose members had sung a song ''that called for violence against women, including rape and necrophilia'' at a party, according to the complaint.   Messages that cropped on Yik Yak disparaged and threatened the feminist group's most visible members. Some of the worst are listed in the complaint: ''Gonna tie these feminists to the radiator and [g]rape them in the mouth,'' ''Can we euthanize whoever caused this?''   Kelli Musick, one of the plaintiffs, who graduated in 2015, said: ''There were days when I felt like I couldn't look away from my phone because a friend or someone I knew would send me a screenshot of a threatening or harassing Yak. We don't blame the app in and of itself. It was a tool. Tools can be used in any way that a person decides to use them.''   But the group did ask the university to request that Yik Yak place a virtual fence around its campus to disable the app. The solution was one Yik Yak had begun using in March 2014 in Chicago-area schools and one it gradually expanded to middle and high schools nationwide after facing criticism from parents and educators.   ''We had parents reaching out to say their 9-year-old has been threatened and harassed on the app,'' said Ross Ellis, the founder and chief executive of Stomp Out Bullying. ''Kids get hysterical when people make mean comments. Their brains are not mature enough to handle it.''   The school administration, citing logistical and first amendment concerns, refused. So the group asked that Yik Yak be banned on the school's Wi-Fi network, a gesture that was primarily symbolic given that students could continue to access it on their personal data plans. The university said no again.   ''This was something over which we had no control,'' said Anna Billingsley, the associate vice president for university relations. ''We couldn't remove the posts from Yik Yak.'' She said that the school offered the protection of campus police and suggested that the students contact Yik Yak and the Title IX office at the university.   ''They told us to report the Yaks to Yik Yak, and if they were found to be credible, Yik Yak would then respond, which is not the case for any other threats of violence on campus,'' Ms. Musick said. ''When it has been a threat of a bomb or a gun, other schools did not say, 'Report it to Yik Yak and they'll follow up.'''   In trying to react to complaints about its product, Yik Yak created geo-fences and added filters that recognized certain keywords, such as ''bomb,'' and would ask users if they wanted to proceed with the message by suggesting: ''Pump the brakes, this Yak may contain threatening language. Now it's probably nothing and you're probably an awesome person but just know that Yik Yak and law enforcement take threats seriously. So you tell us, is this Yak cool to post?''   But little changed and students at schools across the country began to fight back. The College of Idaho student senate requested that Yik Yak geo-fence their campus, and in Georgia Emory University's student government denounced the app in a formal resolution. Students at Clemson University in South Carolina unsuccessfully demanded that the school ban the app after a spate of racist messages.   And at the University of Mary Washington, Ms. Musick and her classmates turned to Ms. Katz to file a complaint with the Education Department. Its Office of Civil Rights opened an investigation, but before it could issue a decision, the White House changed hands and many of the office's employees left. So the women went to district court.   Yik Yak tried to put in place further preventive measures in 2016 first by allowing users to have profiles and handles, then by requiring them. After blowback, the identity markers became optional once again.   Despite these efforts, by this past March, about two and a half years after it had closed a round of funding that raised millions in venture capital, its active users over age 18 had fallen to 264,000, an enormous decline from nearly 1.9 million in November 2014, according to comScore.   Was Yik Yak really that bad? A study at the MIT Media Lab that compared it to Twitter found that posts on the anonymous platform were only slightly more likely to contain vulgar words. The difference was less than 1 percent. ''We find that on anonymous platforms, users are only slightly more likely to use vulgar language than on public ones, and when they do it is not acceptable and leads to negative feedback,'' the authors wrote.   Morgan Hines, who will start her fourth year at Northeastern University in Boston this fall, never encountered nastiness on Yik Yak. ''I thought it was funny,'' she said. ''It formed a lot of camaraderie between students. There would be random shout-outs to things happening on campus, like people who are attractive or being annoying in the library, or a fire alarm going off at 4 a.m.''   But Ms. Hines criticized Yik Yak's hyper-localization. ''Yik Yak was for pockets of people on campus,'' she said. ''If the fire alarm went off at 4 a.m., it only went off at your building, so no one else will give it a thumbs-up.''   That hyper-localization is also what made the cases of harassment particularly galling. Ms. Musick, one of the plaintiffs, said, ''With Yik Yak, in the back of your mind, you know they're not from around the world or other parts of the state, they're right there in your classroom, in your dining hall. On a campus with 4,500 students, that's a pretty small group of people. This isn't some creepy guy in his mom's basement in Indiana.''   In the end, it may have been this aspect of the app that really did it in. Danielle Levitas, the senior vice president for research at App Annie, pointed out that bad press would not necessarily override an app's popularity if it fulfilled a useful function (consider Uber, for example). But, she said, if it does not have something sustainable to offer, it will burn out.   In this case, it seems that being local was to Yik Yak's detriment. When Ms. Hines went home to Kentucky after her freshman year, she forgot about the app. ''I wasn't on campus anymore and I wasn't with my friends anymore,'' she said. And back at Northeastern, ''no one was on campus to comment on anything.'' She added, ''It kind of just became irrelevant in my life.''

"Maybe Private Russian Hackers Meddled in Election, Putin Says","MOSCOW -- Shifting from his previous blanket denials, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia suggested on Thursday that ''patriotically minded'' private Russian hackers could have been involved in cyberattacks last year that meddled in the United States presidential election. While Mr. Putin continued to deny any state role in the hacking, his comments, made to reporters in St. Petersburg, Russia, departed from the Kremlin's previous position: that Russia had played no role whatsoever in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and that, after Donald J. Trump's victory, the United States had become the victim of anti-Russia hysteria among crestfallen Democrats.    Asked about suspicions that Russia might try to interfere in the coming elections in Germany, Mr. Putin raised the possibility of attacks on foreign votes by what he portrayed as free-spirited Russian patriots. Hackers, he said, ''are like artists'' who choose their targets depending how they feel ''when they wake up in the morning.'' Any such attacks, he added, could not alter the result of elections in Europe, America or elsewhere.    Artists, he said, paint if they wake up feeling in good spirits while hackers respond if ''they wake up and read that something is going on in interstate relations'' that prompts them to take action. ''If they are patriotically minded, they start making their contributions -- which are right, from their point of view -- to the fight against those who say bad things about Russia,'' Mr. Putin added, apparently referring to Hillary Clinton.   The Kremlin took a dim view of Mrs. Clinton, considering her far less friendly toward Russia than a President Trump would be because of her blunt criticism of Mr. Putin and his policies in Syria and elsewhere.   Mr. Putin's remarks stopped far short of accepting the conclusions of American intelligence agencies that the Kremlin was behind the election campaign cyberattacks. But they opened room for verbal maneuvering by Moscow -- and also by Mr. Trump -- amid multiple investigations in the United States into Russian meddling, including one by the F.B.I. about the firing of its director, James B. Comey.   Perhaps worried that, as the investigations make headway, evidence will come to light that the Russian state or at least Russians were clearly involved in the hacking, Mr. Putin appeared to be setting up a pre-emptive line of defense, as the Kremlin did when it became difficult to simply deny initially secret Russian deployments to Ukraine in 2014, and to Syria in late 2015.   Swamped by evidence of Russian military involvement in Ukraine and then Syria, the Kremlin retreated from categorical denials to claims that Russians fighting in eastern Ukraine were Russian ''vacationers'' and that burly Russians who appeared in Syria were humanitarian aid workers. It later acknowledged that the supposed aid workers were Russian soldiers.   The questions of Russian hacking, and interaction between Russian officials and members of Mr. Trump's inner circle, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have been a huge thorn in the side of the new administration. The furor has led to the dismissal of Michael T. Flynn as Mr. Trump's national security adviser, forced his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to recuse himself from any Russia-tied election investigation and hampered the administration in fulfilling Mr. Trump's agenda to ''make America great again.''   Mr. Putin's comments on Thursday about Russian hacking echoed those of Mr. Trump, who has dismissed accusations of Russian meddling in the election and said the person responsible for the attack on the Democratic National Committee ''could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.''   Mr. Putin stuck firmly to earlier denials that Russian state bodies or employees had been involved, an accusation leveled by United States intelligence agencies. They concluded in January that Mr. Putin himself had directed a Russian ''influence campaign'' involving cyberattacks and disinformation intended to tilt the November election in Mr. Trump's favor.   ''We're not doing this on the state level,'' Mr. Putin said on Thursday.   The boundary between state and private action, however, is often blurry in Russia, particularly in matters relating to the projection of Russian influence abroad. This provides a measure of plausible deniability for actions that the Kremlin does not want to be linked to publicly.   Nominally private Russian citizens have fought alongside Russian-speaking rebels in eastern Ukraine and taken part in various campaigns to advance Moscow's agenda in Eastern and Central Europe.   While much about Russia's cyberwarfare program is shrouded in secrecy, there is growing evidence that it, too, has drawn on the skills and enthusiasm of nominally private individuals, including college students, who face mandatory military service, and even criminals.   In 2013, Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, told university rectors at a meeting in Moscow that he was on a ''head hunt in the positive meaning of the word'' for coders.   The Obama administration signaled it was worried about Russia's intermingling of state and private hacking when it struck back at Moscow over interference in the 2016 election. In December, it expelled 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States and included among sanctioned Russian companies a private firm set up by a young Russian woman  who called herself ''mishacker.''   American intelligence agencies say a team of Russian hackers affiliated with Russia's military intelligence agency, the G.R.U., stole emails and other data from the Democratic National Committee and then leaked the cache through WikiLeaks.   An expert at muddying the waters and creating confusion, Mr. Putin advanced a number of alternative theories that could help Moscow address any firm evidence that might emerge as a trail leading to Russia.   Stating that modern technology can easily be manipulated to create a false trail, he said, ''I can imagine that someone is doing this purposefully -- building the chain of attacks so that the territory of the Russian Federation appears to be the source of that attack.'' He added, ''Modern technologies allow to do that kind of thing; it's rather easy to do.''   Mr. Putin appeared to be repeating an argument he first made earlier in the week in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro.   ''I think that he was totally right when he said it could have been someone sitting on their bed or somebody intentionally inserted a flash drive with the name of a Russian national, or something like that,'' Mr. Putin told the French newspaper, referring to Mr. Trump. ''Anything is possible in this virtual world. Russia never engages in activities of this kind, and we do not need it. It makes no sense for us to do such things. What for?''   The evolution of Russia's position on possible meddling in the American election is similar to the way Mr. Putin repeatedly shifted his account of Russia's role in the 2014 annexation of Crimea and in armed rebellions in eastern Ukraine. He began by denying that Russian troops had taken part before acknowledging, months later, that the Russian military was ''of course'' involved.   Moscow has been disappointed by Mr. Trump's failure so far to deliver on his election promises to ''get along'' with Russia.   But Mr. Putin told Le Figaro this week that he was ''cautiously optimistic'' that Mr. Trump would be able to break free of people he described as intent on blocking his path toward better relations with Moscow.

Ex-Leader of British Party Scoffs at Report on Russia Ties,"LONDON -- Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, ridiculed a published report on Thursday that suggests United States investigators think he may be able to shed light on any possible collusion between Russia and Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign.  Mr. Farage was responding to an article in The Guardian newspaper on Thursday that said he was a ''person of interest'' in the F.B.I.'s investigation into Moscow's contacts with representatives of Mr. Trump's campaign, including Michael T. Flynn, who briefly served as President Trump's national security adviser.    The Guardian, citing unidentified sources, said Mr. Farage was not accused of wrongdoing but had ''raised the interest'' of the F.B.I. because of his relationships with the Trump campaign and with Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks.   American officials say Russian hackers working for the government obtained documents from the Democratic Party and provided them to WikiLeaks to damage the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.   Under Mr. Farage, the far-right, anti-immigrant UKIP played an influential role in a referendum last year in which British voters supported withdrawing from the European Union, commonly known as Brexit.   The investigators are examining whether Mr. Farage was a link between Mr. Assange and Trump advisers including Roger Stone, who has acknowledged being in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker who is thought to be an agent of Russian military intelligence.   ''This hysterical attempt to associate me with the Putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept Brexit and the election of President Trump,'' Mr. Farage said in a statement to The New York Times.   ''For the record I have never been to Russia, I've had no business dealings with Russia in my previous life and I have appeared approximately three times on RT in the last 18 months,'' referring to the Russian television network that has been accused of serving as a propaganda organ for the Kremlin.   He added that a March meeting he had with Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where the Australian has received political asylum, ''was organized for me by LBC Radio with a view to conducting an interview.'' Mr. Farage has hosted a show on the independent radio station in London.   Mr. Farage said that the Guardian article made him laugh. ''I consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the F.B.I., as I have no connections to Russia,'' he said.     "
'Redacted' Is No Joke On Russian TV Show,"Last week, Lee Camp, an acerbic left-wing comic, dedicated six minutes of his topical TV show, ''Redacted Tonight,'' to the discredited conspiracy theory that it wasn't Russian hackers who leaked emails during the presidential election but Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staff member killed in a botched robbery. Mr. Camp's tepid take -- he doesn't know the truth, but he's skeptical -- was less revealing than his introduction. ''Every day I get an email from at least one person or another who says: Why don't you talk about Seth Rich?'' he said, shouting this demand. ''And that spirals into: Lee Camp has been told not to talk about Seth Rich. And that will soon become: Lee Camp has accepted $1 million to not talk about Seth Rich. And then a week from now, The Washington Post will run with: Russia infiltrates comedian, forces him not to talk about secret Russian agent Seth Rich. Russia!''    If Mr. Camp, who is in his mid-30s, sounds a bit defensive, that may be because it's a challenging time to be a righteous American host of a political comedy show sponsored by the Russian government.    ''Redacted Tonight'' airs weekly on RT America, the English-language channel financed by Russia that American intelligence agencies have described as the ''Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet.'' The program belongs to the television genre pioneered by ''The Daily Show'': A comedic take on the news of the day from an exasperated host and correspondents who mix commentary with jokes.   Mr. Camp -- who looks like a Broadway musical costume designer's idea of a counterculture comedian, with ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' hair and T-shirts bearing images of Bill Hicks or ''Catch-22'' -- has more radical politics than his television peers. Occupy Wall Street and the Bernie Sanders campaign are lodestars. But Mr. Camp covers many of the same topics (net neutrality, global warming) that John Oliver and Samantha Bee do, except that is, when it comes to Russia.   As hacking and Russia's relationship to the Trump campaign increasingly dominate headlines, Mr. Camp's refusal to dig into the story is conspicuous. He avoids the subject on air, and while he does criticize President Trump, his considerable comic bile rarely focuses on him. Mr. Camp, in fact, plays down Mr. Trump as a distraction or as no worse than other elites. The day after Mr. Trump fired the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, whose agency is investigating links between Russia and the president's associates, Mr. Camp alluded to it briefly, and dutifully, only to make fun of the news media for obsessing about the story.   That Mr. Camp does this on RT -- which describes itself as the ''Russian view on global news'' and which paid Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, to speak at the gala where he sat next to Vladimir V. Putin -- raises questions about the comedian's independence, particularly when he delves into the conspiracy about Mr. Rich. Just last month, Andrew Feinberg, a former White House reporter for Sputnik, another Russian-financed media outlet, said that his bosses ''wanted the Seth Rich story pushed.''   Mr. Camp's hard-edge critique of corporate greed and American policy is genuine; he was taking this line in his stand-up act before working for RT. But context matters.   Liz Wahl is a former journalist for RT who quit on air, accusing the network of ''whitewashing the actions of Putin'' in its coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ms. Wahl calls Mr. Camp a ''stooge'' and told me that his comedy plays into the channel's disinformation campaign.   ''The tactic is to use American anger against itself,'' she said. ''They know our divides and aim to make them bigger. To make the angry angrier and the paranoid more paranoid, to push people to extremes.''   Ms. Wahl was working at RT when ''Redacted Tonight'' was being developed (she left shortly before its premiere, in 2014), and she recalled that it was envisioned in the style of ''The Daily Show.'' Mr. Camp has clearly studied the Jon Stewart playbook, leavening serious political arguments with pop culture references, featuring fake-debating correspondents and checking his nonexistent earpiece for a bit. But he pushes skepticism of mainstream media outlets further (he recently described them as ''an elite group of corporate whores'') and says his brand of anti-corporate comedy would never be welcome there.   Mr. Camp turned down my request for an interview, but he has said that he writes his entire show. And in a three-hour discussion with the comic Joe Rogan posted online, Mr. Camp said RT never tells him what to say. He did, however, appear uncomfortable when Mr. Rogan poked fun at Mr. Putin. Mr. Camp quickly changed the subject. Perhaps sensing a dodge, Mr. Rogan, a clever interviewer, zeroed in: ''Putin's a little bit spooky,'' he said. ''Dude's jacking people.''   Squirming in his chair, Mr. Camp abruptly pivoted to a critique of American foreign policy: ''We're blowing people up.''   Ms. Wahl said it was precisely this kind of comment that made him useful to RT. ''It creates the notion that we have no position to assert any moral authority,'' she said. ''It serves the Russian narrative.''   Before he worked for RT, Mr. Camp was a mainstay of the New York comedy scene who had written for The Onion and toured abroad, with a solo show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe called ''Yet Another American Mistake.'' According to several people in the comedy scene, his stand-up diatribes succeeded with like-minded fans but had more trouble with crowds that didn't share his point of view. ''We wouldn't book him for a weekend, let's put it that way,'' said Cris Italia, one of the owners of the New York comedy club the Stand.   Last month, Mr. Camp returned to New York to perform with two fellow stand-ups. ''In Trump's America, I feel freer,'' he said archly at the Cutting Room, a small East Side concert space, before explaining that even if he were to defecate onstage, it ''wouldn't be the craziest thing you see all week.''   He was funniest at his most cynical, describing everyone as replaceable in our economy, including himself. ''My job?'' he said with a Dennis Miller twang. ''It can be replaced by a mop, a joke book and a sense of disillusionment.''   At one point, a fan interrupted his set, yelling, ''Draft Bernie Sanders!'' Mr. Camp looked momentarily thrown off guard. Then the heckler started cursing about the Democratic National Committee.   ''I hear you, but I'm just trying to do a comedy show here.'' Mr. Camp responded, employing Mr. Stewart's old tactic of deflecting political comments by saying he's just a comic looking for laughs. Mr. Camp pointed at the door and said, ''You can have the rally after the show.''   Once Mr. Camp finished and the crowd had filed out, I lingered for a minute on the sidewalk. And while there wasn't any rally, I couldn't help noticing two beefy guys speaking in Russian and laughing uproariously.     "
Denials on Russia Frustrate Even Trump Allies,"In the span of 72 hours, President Trump described the email hacking that roiled the 2016 campaign as a Democratic ''hoax'' and as clear aggression by Russia that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, failed to address. Other times, Mr. Trump has said the hacking might have been done by China.     Or, as he claimed during the first general election debate, the hacking could have been the work of a lone wolf weighing 400 pounds, sitting on his bed at home.   Then there was the time Mr. Trump blamed ''some guy in his home in New Jersey.''   Or, as Mr. Trump has also suggested, there might not even have been hacking at all...   On Saturday, Mr. Trump tried again to focus attention on Mr. Obama.   ''Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action?'' Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ''Focus on them, not T!''   He followed that up with: ''Obama Administration official said they 'choked' when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?''   Government officials, members of Congress from both parties and even some Trump supporters had hoped that, with the campaign behind him, Mr. Trump would finally speak declaratively about the email hacking and recognize the threat Russian cyberattacks present, without asterisks, wisecracks, caveats or obfuscation.   That hope has dissipated. The latest presidential tweets were proof to dismayed members of Mr. Trump's party that he still refuses to acknowledge a basic fact agreed upon by four American intelligence agencies: Russia orchestrated the attacks, and did it to help get him elected.   ''I think he would be rewarded politically for being tough on Russia,'' said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist and an adviser to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Mr. DuHaime suggested that it was time for Mr. Trump to help himself with a public declaration definitively laying the blame on Russia.   ''Most people grew up hearing the Russians are not our allies,'' Mr. DuHaime said. ''He should be tough on them for what they attempted to do.''   It is not easy to explain why the president won't concede the Russia question, but aides and friends say the matter hits him where he is most vulnerable. Mr. Trump, who often conflates himself with the institutions he serves, sees questions about Russia as an effort by Democrats and stragglers from the ''Never Trump'' movement to delegitimize his election victory.   There is another reason, too. Mr. Trump is a wealthy businessman from New York, but he is not a Wall Street titan or a master investor. He is a real estate mogul whose life view is predicated on making deals and who treats almost everything as an open-ended discussion. When it comes to where he stands on Russia and the 2016 election, Mr. Trump, in keeping with his signature approach to almost every issue, appears to be leaving his options open.   It was a winning formula during the campaign. Mr. Trump talked in generalities, refusing to commit to specific policy proposals. ''We're going to have to look at a lot of things very closely,'' was a frequent, vague refrain.   He would speak supportively of both sides of an issue, sometimes in the same sentence, forcing interviewers to scramble to pin him down and leaving supporters and detractors reading what they chose into his words.   ''President Trump treats every issue like an ongoing negotiation by hedging his comments with phrases that allow a flexible interpretation of his position,'' said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist and a former aide to Mitt Romney. ''He refuses to get backed into a corner or pinned down on a specific position so that he always has the option of changing his mind and making a course correction in the future.''   His aides have mirrored that strategy.   On Friday, when Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, was asked by a reporter if the president stood by his lone January statement that Russia was behind the email hacking, Mr. Spicer replied vaguely: ''Of course. He's concerned about any country or any actor that wants to interfere in elections.''   But the campaign is long over. While many of Mr. Trump's allies and supporters are still reluctant to blame Russia, the American intelligence community has said that Russian interference is a fact, not an opinion. Mr. Trump's strategy of muddying his position has let the Russia issue grow, gumming up the gears in his administration's efforts to move forward with major legislation and decisions.   ''Geopolitically, it touches everything,'' Mr. DuHaime said.   That includes some important decisions Mr. Trump will have to make: whether to support tougher sanctions against Russia; to give back Russian properties seized by the Obama administration; or to try to remove Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.   Officials in a number of states have complained that the White House has done little to try to safeguard the 2018 and 2020 elections against potential Russian intrusions, even as evidence grows that there were efforts to tamper with voter rolls last year.   Through it all, the president's allies continue to see Russia as a boogeyman for Democrats and a rapacious news media, an issue his core voters think is manufactured.   ''He doesn't want to be set by this narrative that the Russians hacked the election when he has to negotiate with Russia, who, by the way, sits on China's border,'' said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide to Mr. Trump. ''If Putin adamantly denies that he did it, it's frankly not an issue to the president.''   Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.

"As Elites Switch to Texting, Watchdogs Fear Loss of Transparency","In a bygone analog era, lawmakers and corporate chiefs traveled great distances to swap secrets, to the smoke-filled back rooms of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, or the watering holes at the annual Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. But these days, entering the corridors of power is as easy as opening an app.    Secure messaging apps like WhatsApp, Signal and Confide are making inroads among lawmakers, corporate executives and other prominent communicators. Spooked by surveillance and wary of being exposed by hackers, they are switching from phone calls and emails to apps that allow them to send encrypted and self-destructing texts. These apps have obvious benefits, but their use is causing problems in heavily regulated industries, where careful record-keeping is standard procedure.   ''By and large, email is still used for formal conversations,'' said Juleanna Glover, a corporate consultant based in Washington. ''But for quick shots, texting is the medium of choice.''    Texting apps are already creating headaches on Wall Street, where financial regulations require firms to preserve emails, instant messages and other business-related correspondence.   In March, Christopher Niehaus, an investment banker with the Jefferies Group in London, resigned from his job and was fined nearly $50,000 by British regulators after disclosing confidential client information to a friend over WhatsApp. Deutsche Bank barred its employees from texting and using WhatsApp on their work phones in an effort to curtail underground communication. And last year, prosecutors charged Navnoor Kang, a portfolio manager at the New York State Common Retirement Fund, with securities fraud, accusing him of taking bribes as part of a pay-to-play scheme. According to the indictment, Mr. Kang and his co-conspirators plotted their deeds over, you guessed it, WhatsApp.   The appeal of these apps is no big mystery. Cyberattacks on prominent people -- like the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures executives and the WikiLeaks release of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton's former campaign chairman -- have put the Davos class on high alert. And President Trump's election in November led to a boom in business for encrypted texting apps among those who feared he would intensify surveillance tactics. Whether they are trying to evade the law, arrange fragile deals or just talk candidly without fear of being snooped on, business executives and other leaders have many reasons for wanting a private back channel.   ''After the 2016 election, there's an assumption that at some point, everyone's emails will be made public,'' said Alex Conant, a partner at the public affairs firm Firehouse Strategies and a former spokesman for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Most people are now aware, Mr. Conant said, that ''if you want to have truly private conversations, it needs to be over one of those encrypted apps.''   For now, America's elites seem to be using secure apps mostly for one-on-one conversations, but the days of governance by group text might not be far-off. Last year, a group affiliated with Britain's Conservative Party was discovered to be using a secret WhatsApp conversation to coordinate a pro-''Brexit'' messaging campaign, while a separate WhatsApp group was being used by politicians backing the Remain effort. Steve Baker, the Conservative member of Parliament who led the pro-''Brexit'' group, told The Telegraph that WhatsApp was ''extremely effective'' as a tool for political coordination.   Encrypted chat and email programs have existed for years, but many were clunky and hard to use. That changed when WhatsApp, a messaging program owned by Facebook with more than a billion users, turned on encryption by default for all of its users last year, making it simple for even the tech-averse to talk securely.   Disappearing messages, once the province of teenagers on Snapchat, have also become standard issue for the paranoid, and even mainstream apps like Facebook Messenger now allow users to send secret, self-destructing messages.   Despite their convenience, third-party messaging apps can pose new risks if their security measures are flawed or incomplete. Confide, for instance, was criticized when security researchers found multiple vulnerabilities that could have left users' communications exposed to hackers. (The company said that the issues had been resolved and that Confide offered ''industry-standard cryptography.'')   Self-deleting messages can also foul up long-established record-retention practices and, for some federal employees, they may constitute a violation of the law. White House staff members, for example, are required by the Presidential Records Act of 1978 to store copies of their work-related correspondence, while employees of other federal agencies, including the State Department, are required to save their communications under the Federal Records Act. When those records are created outside of official channels -- or when, in the case of a disappearing message, they're never created at all -- a piece of history is lost.   Few issues produce bipartisan consensus in Washington these days, but the secure messaging trend has drawn criticism from all sides. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, recently filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that Mr. Trump and his associates were ''ignoring or outright flouting'' public records laws by using texting apps like Confide. Judicial Watch, a conservative group, sued the Environmental Protection Agency over its staff members' reported use of Signal, calling the app's popularity among government workers ''disturbing'' and saying that it ''may make it difficult for their work to be overseen.''   ''It's a serious issue that part of the legal record is being destroyed,'' said John Wonderlich, the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a group that advocates open government. ''Lots of record-keeping requirements don't work very well at all for the modern world.''   Secure chats are especially tough to regulate, because they leave few traces by design. But scrutiny of the practice is growing. In March, David S. Ferriero, the nation's archivist, sent a memo to officials at federal agencies reminding them that they were ''responsible for properly managing electronic messages that are federal records'' across a wide range of communications systems.   Representative Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois, recently introduced the Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement (or Covfefe) Act, which would extend the reach of the Presidential Records Act to include social media posts and other digital records. Despite the groaner of a name, a cheeky reference to Mr. Trump's now-infamous misspelled Twitter post, Mr. Quigley's bill addresses a very real issue: As of now, tweets and other social media posts are not explicitly named as protected records.   Daniel Jacobson, a White House lawyer during the Obama administration, told me that the use of apps like Signal and Confide among Trump administration officials might technically amount to criminal activity, under laws that prohibit the destruction of government property. And while White House staff members are unlikely to go to jail for texting, he said that preserving public records was an essential democratic norm, no matter which apps officials use.   ''The public has a right to know what people in the White House worked on,'' Mr. Jacobson said. ''Especially at a time where basic facts are often disputed, it is important to know that the truth will one day be made public.''   Whether illicit or innocent, the use of secure texting apps is probably here to stay. The alternative is just too fragile, in a world where a data breach can mean disaster. Which means it's up to regulators and technologists to find a solution that provides both security and accountability.   If modern communication methods can be aligned with record-keeping laws, it will ensure that when our leaders conduct official business, the public still gets the message.     "
Trump's Son Heard of Link To Moscow Before Meeting,"WASHINGTON -- Before arranging a meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer he believed would offer him compromising information about Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump Jr. was informed in an email that the material was part of a Russian government effort to aid his father's candidacy, according to three people with knowledge of the email. The email to the younger Mr. Trump was sent by Rob Goldstone, a publicist and former British tabloid reporter who helped broker the June 2016 meeting. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he was interested in receiving damaging information about Mrs. Clinton, but gave no indication that he thought the lawyer might have been a Kremlin proxy.    Mr. Goldstone's message, as described to The New York Times by the three people, indicates that the Russian government was the source of the potentially damaging information. It does not elaborate on the wider effort by Moscow to help the Trump campaign.    There is no evidence to suggest that the promised damaging information was related to Russian government computer hacking that led to the release of thousands of Democratic National Committee emails. The meeting took place less than a week before it was widely reported that Russian hackers had infiltrated the committee's servers.   But the email is likely to be of keen interest to the Justice Department and congressional investigators, who are examining whether any of President Trump's associates colluded with the Russian government to disrupt last year's election. American intelligence agencies have determined that the Russian government tried to sway the election in favor of Mr. Trump.   The Times first reported on the existence of the meeting on Saturday, and a fuller picture has emerged in subsequent days.   Alan Futerfas, the lawyer for the younger Mr. Trump, said his client had done nothing wrong but pledged to work with investigators if contacted.   ''In my view, this is much ado about nothing. During this busy period, Robert Goldstone contacted Don Jr. in an email and suggested that people had information concerning alleged wrongdoing by Democratic Party front-runner, Hillary Clinton, in her dealings with Russia,'' he told The Times in an email on Monday. ''Don Jr.'s takeaway from this communication was that someone had information potentially helpful to the campaign and it was coming from someone he knew. Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed.''   It is unclear whether Mr. Goldstone had direct knowledge of the origin of the damaging material. One person who was briefed on the emails said it appeared that he was passing along information that had been passed through several others.   Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, and Paul J. Manafort, the campaign chairman at the time, also attended the June 2016 meeting in New York. Representatives for Mr. Kushner referred requests for comments back to an earlier statement, which said he had voluntarily disclosed the meeting to the federal government. He has deferred questions on the content of the meeting to Donald Trump Jr.   A spokesman for Mr. Manafort declined to comment.   But at the White House, the deputy press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was adamant from the briefing room lectern that ''the president's campaign did not collude in any way. Don Jr. did not collude with anybody to influence the election. No one within the Trump campaign colluded in order to influence the election.''   The president, a prolific Twitter user, did not address his son's controversy on Monday, and instead sought to highlight other issues throughout the morning.   In a series of tweets, the president's son insisted he had done what anyone connected to a political campaign would have done -- hear out potentially damaging information about an opponent. He maintained that his various statements about the meeting were not in conflict.   ''Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen,'' he wrote in one tweet. In another, he added, ''No inconsistency in statements, meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions. In response to further Q's I simply provided more details.''   The younger Mr. Trump, who had a reputation during the campaign for having meetings with a wide range of people eager to speak to him, did not join his father's administration. He runs the family business, the Trump Organization, with his brother Eric.   On Monday, after news reports that he had hired a lawyer, he indicated in a tweet that he would be open to speaking to the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels investigating Russian meddling in the election. ''Happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know,'' the younger Mr. Trump wrote.   Mr. Goldstone represents the Russian pop star Emin Agalarov, whose father was President Trump's business partner in bringing the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013. In an interview Monday, Mr. Goldstone said he was asked by Mr. Agalarov to set up the meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.   ''He said, 'I'm told she has information about illegal campaign contributions to the D.N.C.,''' Mr. Goldstone recalled, referring to the Democratic National Committee. He said he then emailed Donald Trump Jr., outlining what the lawyer purported to have.   But Mr. Goldstone, who wrote the email over a year ago, denied any knowledge of involvement by the Russian government in the matter, saying that never dawned on him. ''Never, never ever,'' he said. Later, after the email was described to The Times, efforts to reach him for further comment were unsuccessful.   In the interview, he said it was his understanding that Ms. Veselnitskaya was simply a ''private citizen'' for whom Mr. Agalarov wanted to do a favor. He also said he did not know whether Mr. Agalarov's father, Aras Agalarov, a Moscow real estate tycoon known to be close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was involved. The elder Mr. Agalarov and the younger Mr. Trump worked together to bring a Trump Tower to Moscow, but the project never got off the ground.   Mr. Goldstone also said his recollection of the meeting largely tracked with the account given by the president's son, as outlined in the Sunday statement Mr. Trump issued in response to a Times article on the June 2016 meeting. Mr. Goldstone said the last time he had communicated with the younger Mr. Trump was to send him a congratulatory text after the November election, but he added that he did speak to the Trump Organization over the past weekend, before giving his account to the news media.   Donald Trump Jr., who initially told The Times that Ms. Veselnitskaya wanted to talk about the resumption of adoption of Russian children by American families, acknowledged in the Sunday statement that one subject of the meeting was possibly compromising information about Mrs. Clinton. His decision to move ahead with such a meeting was unusual for a political campaign, but it was consistent with the haphazard approach the Trump operation, and the White House, have taken in vetting people they deal with ahead of time.   But he said that the Russian lawyer produced nothing of consequence, and that the meeting ended after she began talking about the Magnitsky Act -- an American law that blacklists Russians suspected of human rights abuses. The 2012 law so enraged Mr. Putin that he halted American adoptions of Russian children.   Mr. Goldstone said Ms. Veselnitskaya offered ''just a vague, generic statement about the campaign's funding and how people, including Russian people, living all over the world donate when they shouldn't donate'' before turning to her anti-Magnitsky Act arguments.   ''It was the most inane nonsense I've ever heard,'' he said. ''And I was actually feeling agitated by it. Had I, you know, actually taken up what is a huge amount of their busy time with this nonsense?''   Ms. Veselnitskaya, for her part, denied that the campaign or compromising material about Mrs. Clinton ever came up. She said she had never acted on behalf of the Russian government. A spokesperson for Mr. Putin said on Monday that he did not know Ms. Veselnitskaya, and that he had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting.   Ms. Sanders said at a news briefing that the American president had learned of the meeting recently, but she declined to discuss details.   The White House press office, however, accused Mrs. Clinton's team of hypocrisy. The office circulated a January 2017 article published in Politico, detailing how officials from the Ukranian government tried to help the Democratic candidate conduct opposition research on Mr. Trump and some of his aides.   News of the meeting involving the younger Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Manafort blunted whatever good feeling the president's team had after his trip to Europe for the Group of 20 economic summit meeting.   The president learned from his aides about the 2016 meeting at the end of the trip, according to a White House official. But some people in the White House had known for several days that it had occurred, because Mr. Kushner had revised his foreign contact disclosure document to include it.   The president was frustrated by the news of the meeting, according to a person close to him -- less over the fact that it had happened, and more because it was yet another story about Russia that had swamped the news cycle.

A Secret Service School On Fighting Data Crime,"HOOVER, Ala. -- The classrooms, tucked above a municipal court here in the Birmingham suburbs, are a long way from the White House. But walk through a set of secured doors and into the futuristic-looking work space, and you will find an important wager by the agency best known for protecting presidents, the Secret Service. Only it has almost nothing to do with earpiece-wearing agents or armored cars.    Though the Secret Service may be better known for keeping government executives safe, it also has a mandate to investigate and fight financial and other cybercrimes. And in an era of overworked protection details and nonstop cybercrime, it could use some help.    So here at the National Computer Forensics Institute, the pupils are hardened police officers, prosecutors and, occasionally, a judge. Instruction mimics what the agency teaches its own special agents. And tuition is not only free, but the Secret Service throws in travel, room, board and, for police officers, tens of thousands of dollars of technology to set up their own forensics labs back home.   In exchange, the Secret Service has quietly empowered a network of thousands of law enforcement officers across the country capable of processing digital evidence and indebted to the agency that taught them.   ''The threat nature has increased in the world, and the threats are all more and more integrated with the digital world,'' said Ben Bass, the special agent in charge of the institute. ''So assimilating that into what we do is really important.''   The institute opened in 2008 as a partnership between the Secret Service and the state of Alabama, which contributed space and money for its construction. At the time, few state and local law enforcement agencies had the capability to process digital evidence found on computers and cellphones, even as it was exploding in volume and importance. That left agencies heavily reliant on the Secret Service and the F.B.I. for processing and created a yearslong backlog in many cases.   The Secret Service reasoned that it would be critical to the future of its mission -- not to mention the effectiveness of local and state law enforcement -- to try to change that. The program remains the only one of its kind and scale in the country.   Though its protective mission occupies the public's attention, the Secret Service has been investigating crimes since 1865, when President Lincoln saw the need to create a small force of investigators within the Treasury Department to combat counterfeit currency that was undermining American markets. That mandate has changed and widened in the decades since, along with threats to the country's financial systems, and the agency now investigates bank fraud, credit card fraud, identity theft, child exploitation as well as counterfeiting.   It does so with a reasonably small force. The majority of the Secret Service's 3,300 agents work out of field offices. The F.B.I., by comparison, has more than 13,000. To amplify its effect, the agency relies on dozens of electronic and financial crimes task forces across the country, where local and state law officers and people in academia and businesses work alongside its own agents.   The help has arrived at the right time for the agency, where in recent years low morale, high attrition and more people to protect in more places have conspired to pinch resources. Because protection is a nonnegotiable task, investigations often take the hit.   The effect can be significant. In the 2016 fiscal year, the agency spent 65 percent of its time on protection and 35 percent on investigative work, according to calculations it shared with members of the House Oversight Committee. That was an election year, when protection demands are highest. But it appears the ratio for this fiscal year -- which only included the last month or so of the campaign -- has not changed much, with 60 percent of time going to protection through the end of May. Typically it would be about 40 percent for a post-campaign fiscal year.   Robert Novy, the deputy assistant director for investigations, said the task forces help ensure that cases continue to move forward regardless of protection demands. He also said that they have begun to free the Secret Service's own staff to focus on larger-scale cyberthreats and high-dollar financial crimes.   ''By elevating their capacities and capabilities, it allows us to focus on finding ways to counter more significant financial threats,'' Mr. Novy said.   Still, building the program has proved challenging. A decade after it first opened its doors, the institute trains about 1,100 people a year. But it is running at between 30 percent and 40 percent of capacity because of a shortage of federal funds. For some programs, would-be enrollees can wait as long as three years.   Its financial outlook remains uncertain. President Trump's 2018 budget proposal zeroed out the program, though Randolph D. Alles, the agency's new director, told lawmakers last month that he considered it ''critical'' to the agency and would move money from elsewhere in his budget to pay for it if need be. At the same time, lawmakers in the House and Senate have introduced legislation that could stabilize its funding.   The institute's finances appeared to be on few minds on a recent early summer day in Hoover, where a class of two dozen prosecutors sat in neat classroom rows, computers humming beside their feet, as data from the cellphone of a fictitious drug smuggler flashed onto their computer screens. The evidence was all there in ordered folders: call logs, texts, even compromising photographs of a would-be drug dealer, made visible by powerful software and a few patient instructors.   One room away and a few hours later, two dozen police officers packed into a wood-trimmed mock courtroom listened to another instructor hold forth from the witness stand on the ins and outs of being a good forensics witness. The key, he said, is balancing the use of technical details like ''master boot records'' and ''disk partitions'' with the bigger picture a less tech-savvy jury can more easily grasp.   ''I need to be able to understand it so I can translate it when I go before a panel of 12 people,'' said Jennifer Eugene, a prosecutor from New Jersey, describing her experience in front of a jury. ''The law has not caught up with where the technology is.''   A five-week course for police on the basics of computer evidence recovery is the most popular, and graduates of the course leave here with $28,000 worth of technology and the ability to search seized computers for evidence of a crime. A similar course on mobile devices is growing in popularity. And more advanced courses cover network intrusion.   Prosecutors and judges can take shorter courses meant to familiarize them with digital evidence, which is still relatively new to many courtrooms.   But the mutual benefits of the program were on display, too. Frank Garibay, a detective with the San Antonio Police Department who had returned to the institute as a proctor after taking coursework himself, said his training here had transformed what his department could do.   It had also meant that when officials from the Texas Rangers and Homeland Security Investigations zeroed in on an illegal gambling ring in Texas, they could turn to the Secret Service's San Antonio-based electronic crimes task force, including Mr. Garibay, for help.   The Secret Service paid for members of its task force to travel to the small South Texas town of Falfurrias for a weekend to set up a war room to process digital evidence.   The operation ended up taking down about a dozen illegal casinos, recovered almost $6 million, exposed drug and human trafficing rings, and ultimately public corruption.

Little Expressions on the Big Screen,"In late 2014, the hack of Sony resulted in the publishing of private emails that much of the internet had a great time laughing at. One item considered particularly risible in certain corners was a pitch to the co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment from a sort of youth consultant, averring that ''NBD,'' shorthand for no big deal, was popular text speak among millennials and that it should be used as dialogue in a new ''Spider-Man'' movie.  Sony's latest release, ''The Emoji Movie,'' features among its heroes a female computer hacker who at one point shrugs off a crisis by saying ''NBD.'' I'm not sure if this is an indication of abject cluelessness, or if it represents what I believe some millennials call a self-own.    This film is exactly what its posters would lead you to believe it is: an animated narrative film about emoji. It tells the story of Gene (voiced by T. J. Miller), who is a ''meh'' emoji but who is capable of making more expressions than the blasé one he has been assigned. His versatility is considered a malfunction, even, to some extent, by Gene himself. This leads the effusively smiling leader of the emoji to lobby for Gene's deletion from the phone on which he lives.   The rationalization this movie uses for the anthropomorphization of the emoji is weak, to put it mildly. But once that has been taken care of, Gene goes on his hero's quest in search of the cloud, where he seeks to be reprogrammed so he can do the job he takes so much pride in. He of course has a bumbling sidekick (a high-five emoji) in tow. They enlist the help of the hacker Jailbreak and move through the corridors of their phone. Much labored app humor follows.   For a long time, Hollywood has been propagating the idea that the panderingly, trendily idiotic can be made to seem less so, by polishing it up with bright shiny gloss and enlisting engaging talented performers and writers. I can't be entirely certain of this, but I would say ''The Emoji Movie'' takes this notion to the outer limits of credibility. The voice cast is full of name actors, some of whom have genuine appeal. One of the screenwriters is the very astute Mike White. This movie's ''believe in yourself'' message is borne out, in a perverse way, by the very fact that it even exists. And yet the whole thing remains nakedly idiotic. To add to the pain and despair of the experience, ''The Emoji Movie'' is preceded by a short, ''Puppy,'' featuring the characters from the ''Hotel Transylvania'' animated movies. It is also idiotic.   The Emoji MovieRated PG. Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes.             "
Germans Covering Election Await a Trove of Stolen Files,"BERLIN -- To come here as an American on the eve of Germany's next national political campaign is to go back in time to our own recent past, before the hacks and the (Wiki)leaks led to the paralyzing debate over whether Russia intervened in our presidential election. I arrived in this idyllic, rational and not completely batty world capital (a strange sight to these American eyes) the week before last to find the country's political world on tenterhooks, waiting for disruptive leaks but not knowing when or whether they might come.    A group of hackers -- ''not us,'' say the Russians; ''yeah, you,'' say the Germans -- was sitting on a huge trove of political secrets gathered over the past couple of years.    Its first big attack, on the Bundestag, the German Parliament, came in 2015. It vacuumed up some 16 gigabytes of emails and digital files from at least 16 members' offices, including, officials here believe, that of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Cyberthieves have since struck think tanks related to her party, the Christian Democratic Union, and to its junior coalition partners, the Social Democrats.   None of the data has seen the light of day -- yet. But as the German newspaper Die Zeit reported, ''unknown persons'' have registered a new site called btleaks.com.   That, the newspaper theorized, might be a vehicle through which the hackers release their digital booty ahead of the Sept. 24 election, which will be a referendum on Ms. Merkel, the de facto European Union leader (and, it happens, one of the strongest Continental voices for continued Russian sanctions).   Whatever the case, if the data does leak, Germany will face a test like the one America faced last fall. More specifically, the German media will face a test like the one the American media did.   I had to wonder: Will it do better than we did? And should we have done better in the first place?   The Clinton campaign, its supporters and even some in the media itself have complained since last summer that American news organizations were all too ready to make themselves the weapons of a hostile foreign power, by happily reprinting emails from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton adviser John Podesta, which intelligence officials say were the fruit of Russian hacking. The charge has taken on still more potency with the investigations into whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. (They say they didn't; Russia denies involvement in the hacks.)   The view has its adherents here, including the chief editor of the influential German magazine Der Spiegel, Klaus Brinkbäumer.   ''I wouldn't say the American media failed, but I actually do agree when somebody says that they'd been weaponized and used, it's sad to say,'' he told me over the telephone from his headquarters in Hamburg.   ''It was out there very quickly, and very, very soon, and of course there was a plan behind it,'' he said, ''and I'm not sure every journalist who used this material understood what was behind it.''   Should similarly stolen emails drop into the decidedly tamer media here, Mr. Brinkbäumer told me, Der Spiegel would not use any information it couldn't independently verify.   ''We want to be not as quick as possible but as honest as possible and as sincere as possible -- that means there will be no rush,'' he said.   The editors at Bild, Germany's largest newspaper, plan to go further.   ''We will have a special teaser, and in the teaser we will have a banner saying 'Hacked,' because 'Hacked' is more known than 'Leaked' in Germany,'' Julian Röpcke, the Bild political editor, told me at the paper's offices in the headquarters of its corporate parent, Axel Springer.   ''And then we will have every paragraph where we use leaked information in red,'' he said. ''So we will have black and red paragraphs, and under it we will write something like, 'The information in red was leaked to manipulate your opinion about this person.'''   Mr. Röpcke said Bild's decisions were partly informed by what had taken place in the United States, though he said he wasn't being judgmental about his overseas colleagues.   ''I think we would have made the same mistakes, because it was so early and you didn't really know what was happening,'' he said as we spoke over Cokes in the Axel Springer Journalists Club, a throwback to a bygone newspaper era featuring original wood paneling from The London Times and sweeping views of Berlin.   Then again, United States intelligence officials suspected Russian involvement in the hacking early on. At the time, though, editors at major media outlets -- including this one -- said that if the contents of the emails were newsworthy, they had no choice but to report them.   Hillary Clinton's aides argue that they were covered excessively. The much bigger story, they say, was that the emails were allegedly the fruit of a Russian attempt to undermine the American political process.   ''There were not commensurate journalistic resources committed to investigating the chain of custody of the hacked materials compared with the easy task of just regurgitating what was in them,'' Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton's former press secretary, told me over the phone.   Sensitive to charges of excuse-making, Mr. Fallon added: ''I'm not saying the media is solely to blame. The Clinton campaign made plenty of mistakes.'' But that, he said, ''shouldn't free the media from looking at itself if this is going to be the norm -- where foreign governments are going to interfere in elections.''   Mr. Fallon acknowledged that there had been some newsworthy material in the stolen emails. If there hadn't been, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, would not have had to resign (over emails showing she favored Mrs. Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the primary season), and CNN would not have broken its contributors' contract with Ms. Wasserman-Schultz's interim successor, Donna Brazile (over emails showing she shared with the Clinton campaign a question proposed for a CNN/TVOne candidates' town hall-style forum).   Mr. Fallon directed his criticism at less consequential tidbits, like gossipy quips captured in the email exchanges of Mr. Podesta and the prominent Clinton supporter Neera Tanden. They fed a stream of blog items and social media posts, he said, that allowed ''the Russians to manipulate the news media's attention.''   They also fed the American media's voracious appetite for bite-size, traffic-driving tidbits that are the opiates of the nation's new information addiction.   Several people I spoke with here said they were optimistic that news of the hack-and-leak operation in the United States had helped prepare Europe for similar efforts. They pointed to France, where leaks of stolen emails from Emmanuel Macron's political movement, En Marche, failed to sway the electorate there.   The French newspaper Le Monde, for instance, declared that it would not allow itself to be ''manipulated by the publishing agenda of anonymous actors.''   But the leaks also hit just hours before a legal blackout that forbids candidates and media to share ''electoral propaganda'' 44 hours ahead of voting. And, as Le Monde wrote, it was not enough time to verify any newsworthy material, anyway.   It was never clear that there was much newsworthy in the leaked files to begin with.   As Marcel Rosenbach, a cybersecurity reporter for Der Spiegel, told me, ''If there's actually something in the material that amounts to something -- if there is a scandal to be reported on -- that's the most important question.''   In that case, the German media's fervent hopes for dealing with stolen data will face their true test.   If history, and what I know about reporters everywhere, are a guide, they will publish. That, after all, is the imperative of a free press. But getting the story right means getting the whole story, including when the leaks are part of a suspected state action aimed at swaying opinion.   If we've learned anything so far, it's that the answer to information as a weapon is more information, as a path to the truth. And, yes, we can handle it.     "
Senate Crackdown on Online Sex Trafficking Hits Opposition,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate's latest effort to crack down on online sex trafficking is designed for success. Proposed legislation has an unassailable title, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017, and bipartisan support. And it targets websites that knowingly facilitate the work of sexual predators online. But the bill is running into vigorous opposition from technology companies and digital rights groups alarmed at the potential infringement of online speech.    So far, the bill, which would amend the Communications Decency Act, is sponsored by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and a group of 26 other senators, including eight Democrats.    It follows the culmination of a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, a classified advertisement website notorious for prostitution and trafficking ads.   ''Finally, victims of human trafficking are going to see justice when we get this passed, and that's really important to many of us who have been following this,'' said Mr. Portman, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. This summer, the committee recommended that the Justice Department open a criminal investigation into the website's connection to online sex trafficking, citing evidence that Backpage employees were instructed to delete flagged words indicative of trafficking -- ''Lolita,'' ''rape,'' and ''teenage'' among them -- before publishing the advertisements online.   In federal and state investigations, Backpage has successfully cited as a defense Section 230 of the decency act, which says that websites cannot ''be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.''   If passed, the Portman bill would clarify that Section 230 cannot shield a website from federal trafficking laws. It would also impose liability for knowingly assisting and facilitating online sex trafficking, and allow civil suits related to sex trafficking.   Backpage.com officials did not respond to requests for comment. The website announced in January that it had formally closed its adult section after the Senate investigation found that employers ''knowingly facilitated the criminal sex trafficking of vulnerable women and young girls,'' but trafficking advertisements have been reported in the website's dating section.   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which praised the bill in a letter to senators this week, reported that 73 percent of reported sex trafficking was traced through advertisements on websites like Backpage.   However, some lawyers and members of the technology community say that while they support the policing of websites that knowingly encourage sex trafficking, the broad language of the bill opens other online entities to new legal challenges. With the potential for lawsuits, there is concern that websites would begin to actively and pre-emptively delete and police users' posts and videos.   A similar bill introduced in the House in April, which would not only modify the decency act but create harsher penalties for providers found to have had knowledge of sex trafficking, has been criticized for being even broader than the Senate bill.   ''It would be good for the drafters of the bill to engage seriously with the nontrivial objections that are meant to support freedom of expression online, and it's not freedom of expression to sex traffic,'' said Jonathan L. Zittrain, a professor of internet law at Harvard, emphasizing that critics were not arguing against prosecuting websites like Backpage.   ''They are worried about sites that don't resemble Backpage at all running into trouble if the immunity is lifted,'' he said. Like many other critics of the bill, Mr. Zittrain said he would prefer narrower language or the chance to prosecute websites under current legislation, including the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015.   And despite the strong bipartisan support in Congress, the bill will have to overcome dissent from other lawmakers and Silicon Valley executives concerned about freedom of speech on the internet.   But Senate staff members involved in the bill's development said that they had made an effort to work with tech companies concerned about modifying the decency act. ''We did our due diligence, met these folks on a bipartisan basis for months, and yet they offered no constructive feedback,'' said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Portman. ''It's sad that they'd oppose a narrowly crafted, two-page bill to help stop online sex trafficking of women and children.''   Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who was partially responsible for the inclusion of Section 230 in the decency act while serving in the House, said the bill was ''yet another example of the technical ignorance of Congress threatening the jobs, lives and economic opportunities of millions of Americans.''   ''This bill will make it less likely that tech companies help the victims this bill is meant to protect,'' he said Tuesday in a statement.   Michael Beckerman, president and chief executive of the Internet Association, a trade group that represents major online companies, said in a statement that the bill would create ''a new wave of frivolous and unpredictable actions against legitimate companies rather than addressing underlying criminal behavior.''   Mr. Portman said such criticism of the bill's language was unfounded. ''It seems like a stretch to me,'' he said, adding that he felt the bill clearly targeted companies complicit in trafficking.   ''The alternative is not to do nothing and allow these girls and women to continue to get thwarted in every effort they make to seek justice,'' he said.   In a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday night, Mr. Portman argued that the bill preserved the decency act's ''good Samaritan'' provision, which protects websites that regulate their content.   ''This provision simply protects good actors who proactively block or screen for offensive material and thus shields them from any frivolous lawsuits,'' he said.   For Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland, the bill's language -- in particular phrases like ''assist, support or facilitate sex trafficking'' and ''conduct violates federal criminal law'' -- are too vague in defining what constitutes facilitation and violation. While she supports modest change to the statute, she said she would rather see the courts re-evaluate their interpretation of the law's specific language.   Critics also say the bill opens up websites to potential prosecution by states, a change that could force sites to make costly modifications to meet state laws or expose them to expensive litigation if a law is changed or accidentally ignored, said Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates civil liberties online.   It is a cost that tech giants like Google, YouTube and Twitter can handle, but that would likely stifle the development of new and smaller websites.   ''I worry about the next Google, the next Twitter, the next emerging platform that we would grow to love,'' Ms. McSherry said, ''but it'll never exist because that platform, that business would never get off the ground.''

Explicit Texting on Plane Leads to 2 Arrests,"On a flight from Seattle to San Jose, Calif., on Monday, a woman caught a glimpse of some text messages that alarmed her. A man seated in front of her on the Southwest Airlines flight was ''texting about sexually molesting young children,''  the San Jose Police Department said in a news release.     The man, identified by police as Michael Kellar, 56, of Tacoma, Wash., was using a large smartphone with enlarged text, making it easier for her to read his messages and take photographs of them.   The woman alerted a member of the flight crew, who notified police officers working in the Mineta San Jose International Airport. Mr. Kellar was arrested after the plane landed.   The woman is a preschool teacher, said Detective Sgt. Brian Spears, commander of the San Jose Police Department's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. ''She's definitely a hero in our eyes,'' he said.   Mr. Kellar was charged with attempted child molestation and solicitation of a sex crime, both felonies. He was arraigned on Thursday and was being held without bail at the Santa Clara County Jail.   Police named Gail Burnworth, 50, also a resident of Tacoma, as the person Mr. Kellar was suspected of texting. They have also located two children, ages 5 and 7, who may have been victims of sexual abuse.   Sergeant Spears said the text messages ''described specific sex acts performed on children, as well as bestiality.''   ''It definitely goes beyond just that flight,'' he added. ''There is a history of conversations between them.''   According to a statement from the city of Seattle on Wednesday, it seems that Ms. Burnworth ''had access to the children either as a caregiver or babysitter.'' She was arrested in Tacoma on Monday but was released after prosecutors did not formally charge her within 72 hours.   She was arrested again on Friday night on a federal warrant for conspiracy to produce child pornography.   Southwest Airlines did not provide access to the crew member who alerted police because of the criminal investigation. In an emailed statement, it said, ''We always encourage customers to say something to our employees or law enforcement if they see something suspicious.''   The authorities in California and Washington said federal charges are likely, and the F.B.I. was involved in the continuing investigation.   Capt. Mike Edwards, commander of the Seattle Police Department's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, said the two children who may have been victims remained at their home with their parents.   Police did not identify the teacher who reported the text messages. ''We're very grateful that she was on that plane,'' Captain Edwards said.   ''I think the big message and the big takeaway on this is, for all of us, is to pay attention to what's going on around you,'' he said. ''You never know how important it could be.''   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
"For HBO, Storm Clouds Gather Over What Should Be a Smashing Summer","HBO should be riding high. It just aired the fifth episode of the penultimate season of ''Game of Thrones'' on Sunday night, a week after the previous episode delivered the series' highest ratings ever. The Emmy Awards are a month away, and HBO is primed for another big night after leading all competitors in nominations for a 17th consecutive year.    And yet, the premium cable channel is confronting two major headaches that have turned what should be a triumphant summer into an exhausting one.   Roughly two weeks ago, a hacker began releasing material stolen from HBO in a cyberattack. On Sunday, another wave of material was released, including unaired episodes of two anticipated fall series, ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' and ''The Deuce.'' Though the material that has come out so far has not been damaging to HBO -- there have been no embarrassing emails like there were in the attack that hit Sony in 2014 -- it has certainly been an irritant that has shown no sign of fading.    And this weekend's deadly rallies in Charlottesville, Va., also served to remind HBO that the public outcry over its recent announcement of a new alternate-history drama called ''Confederate'' may linger for some time.   All of this is happening as HBO's parent company, Time Warner, is on the brink of a merger with AT&T.   The storm surrounding ''Confederate'' started shortly after HBO announced in mid-July that the next project from the ''Game of Thrones'' creators D.B. Weiss and David Benioff would be an alternate history drama in which the South successfully seceded during the Civil War, and government-sanctioned slavery was still a reality.   A backlash emerged, with some accusing HBO of being cavalier with the topic of slavery and the contemporary plight of black life in the United States. A social media campaign built around the hashtag #NoConfederate began trending on Twitter.   Several prominent writers denounced the series, including Ta-Nehisi Coates, who wrote in The Atlantic  this month: ''African Americans do not need science-fiction, or really any fiction, to tell them that that 'history is still with us.' It's right outside our door. It's in our politics. It's on our networks.''   Then came this weekend's events in Charlottesville, where a rally of white nationalists turned into a series a melees and a 32-year-old woman was killed when a car sped into a crowd of counterprotestors.   One of the creators of the #NoConfederate campaign, April Reign, who also created the #OscarsSoWhite social media campaign, said that the events over the weekend were a reminder that ''we have not fully reconciled what the Confederacy means.''   ''How is this an alt-history when we have things like Charlottesville playing out?'' she said in a telephone interview.   #NoConfederate HBO: ""What if the South had won the Civil War?""Black people: pic.twitter.com/qCQq3tDAen -- Awad (@AwDaniel23) August 12, 2017   HBO defended the series in a statement on Monday.   ''We support everybody's right to express an opinion but the suggestion of irresponsibility on our part is simply undeserved,'' the network said. ''HBO has a long history of championing intelligent storytelling and we will approach this project with the same level of thoughtfulness that has always defined our programming. We recognize the sensitivity of this project and will treat it with the respect that it deserves. Our creative partners should be given time to develop the series rather than face prejudgment.''   The backlash to the show has also spurred a debate about whether the #NoConfederate campaign constituted a form of censorship, because the criticism of the show developed before a script was even written. Judd Apatow, the television and movie producer, said on Twitter that ''to criticize work before it exists is dangerous to all expression.''   HBO said that ''Confederate'' would not go into production until ''Game of Thrones'' was finished next year, meaning that it will probably be at least two years before the show is ready to air.   The network has dealt with pre-emptive furor before. In the months before the release of the science fiction drama ''Westworld,'' the network faced criticism that it was once again relying on sexual violence against women as a plot point in a prominent show. (''Game of Thrones'' has also been subject to this criticism during its run, another reason that some thought Mr. Weiss and Mr. Benioff, who are both white, were less-than-ideal creators of a show that dealt with slavery.) But by time ''Westworld'' debuted, much of that had died down, and the first-year drama was showered with good reviews, strong ratings and numerous Emmy nominations.   In the meantime came the release on Sunday of more hacked episodes from upcoming series, including a new episode of ''Insecure,'' and several unaired episodes from ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' and the new series ''The Deuce,'' which will form the backbone of HBO's fall lineup. (To complicate matters further for HBO, a producer of ''The Deuce'' will be sentenced Tuesday for his role in the fatal cocaine overdose of a 38-year old dermatologist).   The hacker, who refers to himself as Mr. Smith, described this as the ''third wave'' of material. So far, the attack has remained relatively contained compared with the one involving Sony, which included a trove of embarrassing and racially insensitive emails that forced the studio's executives to publicly apologize and meet with civil rights activists. HBO has said that it did not believe its email system ''as a whole'' had been breached, though the hacker has had access to some emails and released a number from the account of one network executive.   The information released from the Sony theft was also eventually made available on WikiLeaks, making private emails easily searchable by the public.   In contrast, the HBO hacker has primarily released the material to members of the news media, and it is not clear how widely some of the hacked episodes have actually spread online. Further, the hacker has not released any upcoming episodes of ''Game of Thrones,'' HBO's crown jewel, which has two episodes left this season.   Mr. Smith has said that he wants HBO to pay him a ransom for the rest of the material. On Monday, the hacker provided a copy of a letter that he had purportedly sent to HBO. ''You disappointed us, so we will bring down your nasty empire,'' it read.   HBO said in a statement that it was no longer in communication with the hacker, and that it would not comment on every bit of material that was released.   ''The hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention,'' the network said. ''That's a game we're not going to participate in. Obviously, no company wants their proprietary information stolen and released on the internet. Transparency with our employees, partners, and the creative talent that works with us has been our focus throughout this incident and will remain our focus as we move forward. This incident has not deterred us from ensuring HBO continues to do what we do best.''   But it has contributed to an unexpectedly anxious summer.     "
How to Avoid Phony Facebook Phone Lines,"Q. Why doesn't Facebook have its telephone-support number listed on its website? I often have questions about using the site. A. Facebook does not list a telephone number for technical support because Facebook does not offer technical support over the phone. However, if you search the web for a Facebook tech hotline, you will find plenty of phone numbers on the results page -- and most of them are frauds.     Dialing one of these ''Facebook support'' numbers can get you on the line with a con artist (often working in an overseas call center) who may make all sorts of claims about your account security or general computer health. Many promise to fix the problem in exchange for payment -- sometimes in the form of iTunes gift-card numbers, which are used as currency in shadier parts of the internet. Because you have inadvertently supplied your phone number, failing to supply payment can lead to a barrage of harassing calls claiming that your Facebook account is becoming further compromised.   If you need assistance with your Facebook account, the company's main resource is its online Help Center, which consists of pages of frequently asked questions on common topics, like managing your friends list, reporting abuse and keeping your account secure from intruders. You can report problems with your account by submitting a form on the site. The Help Center area also has community discussion forums, where you can post specific questions and get advice and (hopefully) answers from other Facebook users.   Facebook is not the only company attracting its share of scammers hoping to capitalize on the situation; many free social-media services (including Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter) send users to their online help guides in lieu of telephone-based support. If you think a company may have live customer-service representatives to contact, check for a number directly on its site instead of searching the web -- but make sure the listed number is actually for technical support and not for the general corporate switchboard.   If you find human interaction works better for you for technical support, consider hiring a personal computer trainer (Angie's List and Thumbtack are two possible sources for finding help locally) or asking for help in a nearby computer shop. Friends and family can be another source of help.   As for internet-based fraud that targets unsuspecting users, the Federal Trade Commission's website keeps a running list of frauds to avoid. On the site, you can also sign up to get fraud alerts by email.

Shaming Extremists Online Becomes a Mainstream Tool,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Riding a motorized pony and strumming a cigar box ukulele, Dana Cory led a singalong to the tune of ''If you're happy and you know it clap your hands.'' ''You're a Nazi and you're fired, it's your fault,'' she sang. ''You were spotted in a mob, now you lost your freaking job. You're a Nazi and you're fired, it's your fault.''    ''All together now!'' Ms. Cory, 48, shouted to a cheering crowd in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood on Saturday. They were protesting a rally planned by far-right organizers about a mile away.   ''Dox a Nazi all day, every day,'' she said.    Online vigilantism has been around since the early days of the internet. So has ''doxxing'' -- originally a slang term among hackers for obtaining and posting private documents about an individual, usually a rival or enemy. To hackers, who prized their anonymity, it was considered a cruel attack.   But doxxing has emerged from subculture websites like 4Chan and Reddit to become something of a mainstream phenomenon since a white supremacist march on Charlottesville, Va., earlier this month.   ''Originally it was little black-hat hacker crews who were at war with each other -- they would take docs, like documents, from a competing group and then claim they had 'dox' on them,'' said Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University who wrote a book about the hacker vigilante group Anonymous. ''There was this idea that you were veiled and then uncovered.''   Now the online hunt to reveal extremists has raised concerns about unintended consequences, or even collateral damage. A few individuals have been misidentified in recent weeks, including a professor from Arkansas who was wrongly accused of participating in the neo-Nazi march. And some worry that the stigma of being outed as a political extremist can only reinforce that behavior in people who could still be talked out of it.   Doxxing was on the minds of a number of protesters on the streets of San Francisco on Saturday. In the Castro and Mission neighborhoods and Alamo Square, the home of the famous row of houses known as the Painted Ladies, thousands participated in counter-demonstrations to the right-wing rally. There was the energy of a street party -- children and dogs joined in, protesters shared baked goods, and the bars nearby were full.   Marla Wilson, 35, of San Francisco, said she was appalled when she saw white supremacists marching so brazenly in Charlottesville. Doxxing, she believed, was an effective way to make people think twice about being so bold with their racism.   ''Some of what is happening now will make these white supremacists realize why their grandparents wore hoods,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''At least then there was shame.''   The ethics -- and even the definition -- of doxxing is murky. It is the dissemination of often publicly available information. And, some at the protest asked, are you really doxxing a person if he or she is marching on a public street, face revealed and apparently proud? It is not as though they are hiding their identities.   But Tony McAleer, a former white supremacist leader who now runs Life After Hate, a rehabilitation program for neo-Nazis, called doxxing a '' passive aggressive violence.'' He said publicizing the names and workplaces of neo-Nazis may offer some level of solace to people outraged by them, but it makes his job more difficult.   ''For us, it slows things down. We try to integrate people back to humanity,'' Mr. McAleer said. ''If isolation and shame is the driver for people joining these types of groups, doxxing certainly isn't the answer.''   In short, once someone is labeled a Nazi on the internet, that person stays a Nazi on the internet.   Internet vigilantism has a checkered history. In April 2013, amateur detectives on Reddit used screen shots of security camera footage to identify two men as being connected to the Boston Marathon bombing. The New York Post put the image on the cover under the headline ''Bag Men.''   But the two young men pictured were not the bombers. At one point, Reddit sleuths even set their sights on a student from Brown University, about 60 miles away in Providence, R.I., who was missing. He had nothing to do with the bombing; he had committed suicide.   The next year, doxxing became a tool by in the ''GamerGate'' controversy, an online dispute purportedly about ethics in video game journalism that became a foundational moment for some of today's fringe far right. Mostly male video-game players began to publish personal information -- including home address and phone numbers -- for women in their community, typically journalists and game designers who they said were unfairly politicizing gaming culture.   For Ms. Coleman, the real mainstream moment for online vigilantism was in 2015, when an image of a dentist standing over a lion he had shot swiftly spread on social media. The lion was Cecil, a well-known conservation icon. Animal lovers seethed. The actress Mia Farrow even posted the dentist's home address on Twitter.   ''People went berserk,'' Ms. Coleman said. ''That, to me, was this interesting turning point where it showed the general public would be willing to jump into the fray.''   Charlottesville has made doxxing even more commonplace.   ''For a long time it was only a certain quarter of people on the internet who would be willing to do this,'' Ms. Coleman said. ''It was very much hinged on certain geek cultures, but there was an extraordinary quality to the Charlottesville protest. It was such a strong public display I think it just opened the gates.''   The right-wing rally ultimately fizzled on Saturday, but counter-protesters were still on the lookout.   ''It's important to dox Nazis,'' said Andrea Grimes, 33, of Alameda, Calif. She held a sign that read: ''White people pick one: Be the problem. Be the solution.'' She said she had ''outed'' white supremacists to their parents, which she said often worked well to stop bad behavior online.   Ms. Cory, the ukulele player moving by electric pony, said that she had posted that morning a picture of a man she thought was a white-pride agitator. He was at a local train station wearing camouflage and smoking a cigarette near a car with Oregon license plates.   ''They're here, '' she said. Then she started the next song: ''Tiki Torch Nazis,'' set to ''Beauty School Dropout'' from the musical ''Grease.''   Nearby, Jim Alexander, 55, a software engineer, was carrying high a sign with the words, ''Hug an Extremist.''   Asked about the message, he lowered the placard and looked at it again.   ''Unfortunately, I think this might not work,'' Mr. Alexander said.     "
A Conspicuous Absence of Data,"The story started, as many do, with our own confusion. The most unusual of presidential elections -- one marred by Russian trolls, a digital Watergate-style break-in and the winning candidate's dire warnings of a ''rigged election'' -- was followed by the most unusual period of acceptance. In the immediate aftermath of the 2016 election, government officials, the Clinton campaign, intelligence analysts, and civic and legal groups all appeared to calmly accept claims that votes had not been hacked.    I had been on the cyber beat for six years and had grown accustomed to deep, often lengthy digital forensics analyses of cyberattacks against a wide range of targets: Silicon Valley start-ups, multinational conglomerates, government agencies and our own Times breach by Chinese government hackers. In the vast majority of cases, it takes investigators months or years to discover that hackers had indeed been lurking undetected on victims' machines.   Yet American intelligence officials were adamant in a report in January -- just two months after Election Day -- that vote tallies had not been hacked. This despite the broad consensus among United States intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election through an extensive disinformation and propaganda campaign, as well as the hacking of electoral databases and websites, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.    My colleagues Michael Wines, Matthew Rosenberg and I set out to find out how government officials had nixed the possibility of vote hacking so readily. It was especially unclear to us given that officials at the Department of Homeland Security testified last fall that Russian hackers probed election systems in 21 states, with varying degrees of success, and that months later, a National Security Agency report found that Russian hackers had indeed successfully infiltrated VR Systems, an election service provider in eight states, including the battlegrounds North Carolina, Florida and Virginia.   As we dug more into our investigation, the more unresolved incidents we found.   Among other things, we learned that intelligence agencies had intentionally worded their conclusions to specifically address ''vote tallying,'' not the back-end election systems -- conclusions that were not even based on any in-depth investigation of the state election systems or the machines themselves, but on the accounts of American spies and digital intercepts of Russian communications, as well as on assessments by the Department of Homeland Security -- which were largely superficial and not based on any in-depth investigation of the state election systems or machines themselves.   In fact, we discovered that precious little research had been conducted, the result of legal limits on the authority of intelligence agencies to address domestic issues and states' historic reluctance to permit federal oversight of elections.   Michael Wines, who covers election issues for the Times, said that what stood out to him was the vulnerability of the nation's vast Rube Goldberg election system. Elections, he explained, ''are run by understaffed, underfinanced and sometimes undertrained local officials, serviced by outside contractors who may or may not be well vetted, conducted with equipment and software that may or may not be secure.''   And Matthew Rosenberg, who covers national security issues for the Times, discovered that the intelligence community's conclusion -- that the Election Day vote was not hacked -- was extremely limited in scope.   I started calling around to the election security and technology experts who had witnessed some of the troubles that cropped up on Election Day. I found that they, too, were still searching for answers and were befuddled by the lack of any substantial investigation.   We zeroed in on Durham, N.C. -- a reliably blue county in a swing state that went for Donald J. Trump -- where a breakdown in the electronic check-in software prevented hundreds of would-be voters from casting their ballots and hundreds more to simply give up in the face of long lines.   Officials there relied on check-in software sold by VR Systems. Nobody in Durham -- or any other county that relied on VR Systems's electronic poll books -- was ever informed that their equipment had been compromised by Russian hackers. And yet Durham County officials rebuffed several offers to examine their systems at no cost -- from the D.H.S., the F.B.I. and even Free & Fair, a group of qualified forensics investigators, many with security clearances.   Susan Greenhalgh, one of the few election technology specialists fielding technical complaints from North Carolina on Election Day, told me she was still haunted by what happened in November, and even more so by the lack of any follow-up investigation. ''If you were looking to influence an election, one thing you could do is keep people from voting in a targeted county by monkeying with the e-pollbooks so people couldn't check in, which would lead to long lines and chaos at the polls,'' she said.   ''This,'' she told me, referring to what she witnessed in Durham on Election Day, ''is exactly what that looked like.''   To this day, county, state, and federal officials have yet to investigate what transpired in Durham in November.   Instead, Durham officials asked Protus3, a little-known Raleigh firm comprised primarily of physical security experts and former law enforcement types with little, if any, of the technical expertise that is typically standard for breach investigations, to conduct an audit.   The firm's confidential report was unlike any data breach investigation I have seen in my six years on this beat. Investigators had done none of the malware or coding forensics necessary to understand whether hackers had sabotaged VR Systems's software, instead basing their analysis largely on eyewitness accounts of poll workers with limited technical understanding. When I shared the report with some of the top digital forensics experts in the country, many had visceral reactions: They simply could not believe that this was the definitive take on what transpired in Durham that day.   But through the course of our reporting, Michael, Matthew and I discovered that this was the norm.   There was a seeming lack of interest in doing much of anything about the problems on Election Day, or even in securing future elections. ''Bills to tighten election security are languishing in congressional committees,'' Michael noted. ''The White House is focused on erasing fraud by individual voters, which experts say is a miniscule problem at its worst. A vast throng of voting machines that Congress financed after the disputed 2000 presidential election are now outdated, and no one wants to pony up the cash to modernize them.''   The more places we looked, the worse things looked. In fact, we discovered that VR Systems was not the only back-end supplier of election services that was hacked by Russians ahead of Election Day. Two more vendors that provide critical election services were also hacked.   Follow Times Insider on Twitter.

Vatican Shines a Light on Child Abuse as Claims Against Priests Persist,"VATICAN CITY -- For a church hierarchy excoriated for decades over the sexual abuse of children in its trust, hosting a conference this week about the spreading scourge of online child pornography was an opportunity to strike a positive note about the Vatican's role in protecting minors. ''Yes, yes, yes,'' said Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state, when asked Tuesday night at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome if the Catholic Church could lead a global response to the problem.     But in an awkward confluence of events, the four-day congress, Child Dignity in the Digital World, is taking place mere weeks after the Holy See recalled Msgr. Carlo Capella, a church diplomat in the Vatican's Washington Embassy, amid accusations that he had possessed child pornography.   It was just the latest of the abuse accusations against priests that have dogged the church around the globe for decades even as it has promised to punish predators and protect the preyed upon. Advocates for the victims have questioned the church's commitment.   Last week, as organizers prepared for the congress -- with its keynote address by Cardinal Parolin, the second-highest-ranking official after Pope Francis; blanket coverage by the church's news media; and a papal audience with Francis on Friday -- the Canadian police issued an arrest warrant for Monsignor Capella. He was accused of distributing child pornography during a Christmas visit in 2016 to Ontario.   Cardinal Parolin, speaking to reporters on Tuesday before his address, called the case a ''very painful affair, a great trial for all those who are involved.'' He said the priest's case was being handled with the ''utmost seriousness.'' The Vatican has also said that the Holy See's chief prosecutor was investigating and that if the monsignor was tried and convicted, he could be sentenced up to 12 years in a Vatican jail.   The Vatican has done much to address child abuse by clergy members, which has threatened to stain the entire church. (Pope Benedict XVI once memorably called it ''filth.'') It has removed abusive priests, worked more closely with local law enforcement officials, toughened its laws and generally adopted a ''zero tolerance'' approach.   But advocates for victims have argued that the Vatican's invocation of diplomatic immunity to recall the Italian monsignor from the United States shows that it still prioritizes protecting its own.   In his speech before top Italian officials and representatives from Interpol, the United Nations, Russia, China, the United States, Facebook and Microsoft, Cardinal Parolin spoke at length about the growing threat of internet abuse on the spirit and psyches of young users. He acknowledged that when it came to the exploitation and abuse of children, ''over the past few decades, this tragic reality has come powerfully to the fore in the Catholic Church, and extremely grave facts have emerged.''   Last month, Francis said in unscripted remarks to a commission he had created to advise him on the issue that the church had ''arrived late'' to the crisis. He lamented his leniency, early in his pontificate, toward an Italian priest who subsequently continued his abuse.   ''The old practice of moving people around and not confronting the problem made consciences fall asleep,'' the pope said. He said he would limit the chances of pedophile priests to appeal their convictions by church tribunals.   But critics say Vatican action has lagged behind the pope's words. For example, a tribunal to discipline bishops who cover up abuse was disbanded because, the pope said, the Vatican already had the requisite offices to deal with the issue.   A commission Francis created with top cardinals, outside experts and abuse victims (the committee's only two victims have since left) has seemed stifled by Vatican bureaucracy.   And the pope brought  Cardinal George Pell to Rome as a top adviser despite allegations of abuse against him. The cardinal is now back in Australia facing charges of sexual assault against minors.   Advocates for abuse victims say they consider the Capella case a shameful echo of an earlier episode involving Josef Wesolowski, a Polish archbishop accused of abusing children in the Dominican Republic, where he served as the Vatican ambassador. The Vatican removed the archbishop and denied appeals that he be tried in the Dominican Republic. He was defrocked and died in the Vatican before facing justice.   The Rev. Hans Zollner, a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, said he was confident that this time, the accused cleric would face justice.   ''Everyone who commits a crime needs to be punished,'' he said. ''Period.''   The congress, meanwhile, is seeking ways to protect children in what has been depicted as a frightening digital world, where abusers surf a dark web and child pornography proliferates.   The conference has included top experts in the field speaking about the risks as more children in developing countries go online. They have discussed troubling statistics, such as the finding last year by the Internet Watch Foundation that more than 57,000 websites contained images of children being sexually abused. And they have sat on panels such as one called International Politics and Law Regarding Child Sexual Abuse.   For years, top Vatican officials in Rome had dismissed the abuse crisis as a unique product of the Anglo-Saxon world, and suggested that it had been overplayed by the news media. But organizers of the congress said the majority of the experts came from countries in the global north because that is where the problem has been confronted most aggressively.   In an interview, Father Zollner said that on his global travels looking into the problem, he had observed that bishops and clerics in countries such as Malawi were finally facing an issue they would not talk about as recently as a year ago. But other nations are still constrained by local cultural taboos about discussing child abuse, he said.   Italy, he noted, was not without its own bombshell reports of sexual abuse in the church. He compared the book ''Lust,'' about abuse in the Vatican, by the investigative journalist Emiliano Fittipaldi, to the breakthrough reports by The Boston Globe's Spotlight team on the cover-up of priests' sexual abuse of children.   Father Zollner he said the media focus on Monsignor Capella could have a positive side effect and put ''more attention to the topic of the congress,'' which, he said, was to better understand the phenomenon of child pornography and how to prevent it.   ''That is our whole purpose,'' he said.     "
'Dear Equifax: I Want Out.' If Only It Were That Easy.,"Twitter: @ronlieber The emails have landed in my inbox, one every other day or so since Equifax revealed that cyberthieves had helped themselves to the Social Security numbers and dates of birth of more than 140 million Americans in the company's files. And though the words differ (and some are unprintable in this space), the messages all end with the same demand: I want out.    I want out of Equifax's system. That company no longer has permission to make money off my personal data. I want them to delete my file and never start a new one.   It's hard to blame people for wanting to quit in a fit of pique. This is an industry that uses our personal and financial data as its product, and the real customers are the banks and others who want to check up on us. And this breach isn't like those at other companies that have let their data loose, like Yahoo or Target, where you can simply find another company to patronize.    So, can you dump Equifax? And if not, shouldn't you be able to?   First, some practicalities. When you sign up for a credit card or a mobile phone or any number of other loans or services, you agree -- whether you know it or not -- for the provider to send a report card on you to credit reporting agencies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.   So let's say you no longer trust Equifax to store your data in the wake of its breach. Sure, you could approach all of those providers and try to persuade them not to send data about you to Equifax each month. But it would be far easier to simply ask Equifax to erase your file and not make a new one.   But what happens if you need to borrow money in the future and you have credit files only at Experian and TransUnion? This poses an enormous problem when it comes time to make the biggest of all purchases -- a home. Fannie Mae, whose rules govern the standards for many mortgages, wants information from all three credit ''repositories,'' as the company puts it.   There is already a potential out in the rules that allows for data from just two agencies if that is ''the extent of the data available.'' While this rule may exist to help people with a limited credit history, there's no reason Fannie couldn't also apply it to people with an extensive history that happens to reside only at Experian and TransUnion, and not at Equifax.   This wouldn't be ideal for the mortgage industry, though. Credit reports tend to be riddled with errors, so lenders prefer a wider range of data to survey. ''Lenders will compare the three and make their best guess,'' said Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a research group. ''They kind of triangulate the errors.''   While it's a nifty trick when an industry's rank incompetence seems to necessitate a permanent triumvirate, a better solution might be a duopoly that actually cares about getting the data right.   Lenders who deal in smaller amounts seem flexible enough, and would have to become more so if more people had only two major credit files. American Express already is. It simply looks to the other two big credit bureaus for underwriting guidance if an applicant does not have a file at the third, said Ashley Tufts, a company spokeswoman. (She declined to comment on why American Express planned to continue to send data to Equifax, given the bureau's now proven inability to protect it.)   Some readers, many of whom will have no need for mortgages or much new credit in the future, have tried to delete their Equifax files since the breach. One person sent letters making his demand to Equifax's former chief executive, Richard F. Smith, before he retired last week. (The request received no reply.) Others have called the company's various call centers. Often, they couldn't get through or waited for more than hour and then spoke to someone who insisted that it was not possible to have a file deleted.   Peter Herman, a self-described recovering attorney in Charleston, S.C., had a typical experience: a long wait, a number of prompts, a disconnection and a firm ''no'' on deleting his file. Then came an odd warning from the live human being he did reach. Any attempt to get his lenders to stop sending payment information to Equifax, Mr. Herman said he had been told, might result in his credit score being ruined because his payments would be marked late. ''I did not then ask for a supervisor, I was so befuddled,'' he said.   Equifax doesn't have to deny these kinds of requests, according to Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney with the National Consumer Law Center and an expert on the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the federal law that governs these matters. That law doesn't prohibit Equifax from shutting down a person's file, though there is a narrow exception, she noted, for overdue child support notifications.   I had hoped that Equifax would have an on-the-record conversation about why you just can't quit the company, but no one would speak with me. In fact, no one has been willing to speak with me since this whole mess began, though I do get some emailed statements from time to time.   So we can only let Mr. Smith, Equifax's former chief executive, speak for the company. In hearings this week, he spoke out of both sides of his mouth on the subject of our power to cut ties with Equifax. He said that the breach was horrific and described the task of his successor as one of resurrection. And at first, he seemed to suggest that Equifax should give people what they want.   ''I envision as this evolves over time, the consumer will have an opportunity to invite into their world who they want to have access and who they do not,'' he said, describing the company's efforts to create a new paradigm of consumer control over their credit history. ''It will be their choice and power, not ours.''   The next day, however, he sang a different tune when Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, asked him to answer a yes-or-no question about whether people should be able to delete their data from Equifax's systems. Mr. Smith hemmed and hawed and talked about the ability to lock one's credit file. But eventually, he conceded that his answer was no.   Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat who pursued a similar line of questioning in an earlier hearing, thinks Mr. Smith got it wrong. While she has not included file deletion rights in a data protection bill she recently reintroduced, she didn't rule it out when I spoke with her by phone.   ''We're not done with them,'' she said. ''We should be able to say, 'Get out of my life; I want nothing to do with you.'''     "
Hacking Casts a Pall,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Pavel Cherkashin, a Russian investor based in this city, thought he had the perfect name for a Catholic church that he is spending $11.5 million converting into a tech palace. It would be called Hack Temple. But that was before the nearly daily deluge of news about Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election by hacking computers and using Facebook and Twitter to spread inflammatory messages and sow division.    ''We had so many concerns from our investors saying this would be inappropriate and we should change it,'' said Mr. Cherkashin, 44, who planned to officially open Hack Temple this fall. ''A bunch of Russian guys opening a hacker temple in the middle of San Francisco at a time when Russian hackers are considered the most evil in the world. They say you can't.''   With news of the hacking and influence campaigns escalating all year, the Russian immigrant community of Silicon Valley, which numbers in the tens of thousands, is in a strange new position. Some Russian venture capitalists said start-ups were more wary about taking their funding, while several Russian-born engineers said they were being treated differently socially and in their companies. Lawyers also said some tech firms were installing tighter security measures restricting what data foreign-born coders can see.    At the same time, many said that as Russia gained a reputation for its hackers, interest in hiring its tech talent was increasing.   The tension is new. Russian immigrants helped build the last generation of Silicon Valley behemoths: The Google co-founder Sergey Brin and the early Facebook investor Yuri Milner are both Russian-born.   Now when Mr. Cherkashin, a partner at GVA Capital, which is investing $120 million in start-ups, pitches companies on why they should take investments from him, he gets skeptical questions as soon as they hear his accent, he said.   ''It feels like if you're a politician and you fell into a sex scandal, and everybody knows you for this, and every time someone recognizes you they have this smile on their face, 'So how's your personal life doing?' '' said Mr. Cherkashin, whose firm was incorporated in the United States.   ''This is how I feel every time I meet with an investor and they hear my Russian accent,'' he added. ''They have this smile on their face.''   Prospective partners and start-ups invariably ask the same question, Mr. Cherkashin said: Is his money clean?   ''This question comes up two or three times a day,'' he said. ''I don't think people would ask this question to a manager from another region.''   Julian Zegelman, an entrepreneur and a lawyer who represents and invests in Russian-speaking founders, said potential local tech partners worried they would accidentally get into business with the Russian government.   ''They don't want to be invested or dealing with companies whose technical talent is captive in Russia,'' he said.   Mr. Zegelman said he had noticed that some cybersecurity firms, big tech companies, government customers and large venture capital firms were the most wary about working with new Russian immigrants. Yet some start-ups and small investment firms are more interested in Russian talent now.   ''If you would have asked 10 years ago what Russia was known for, it would be Putin, the oligarchs and oil,'' he said, referring to Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin. ''Now when you ask folks, 'What do you think about Russia?' you get things back like: 'Oh, great cryptography.' 'Oh, it's a lot of talented engineers.'''   Leonard Grayver, a lawyer specializing in start-ups who is on the board of the American Business Association of Russian-Speaking Professionals, said the hacking had put Russian tech talent at ''the forefront.'' His firm brokers technology deals between Russia and Silicon Valley, handling tech licensing and talent acquisitions, and he said the average size of a deal had risen to $4 million this year, from $1 million to $2 million last year.   And as companies staff up with Russian talent, he is getting a new question that he finds bizarre: ''Are we letting the wolf in the henhouse? '' Some companies have asked him to help arrange for heightened internal security, he added.   ''A lot of clients are trying to find ways to hire those Russian hackers and at the same time instituting heightened security protocols internally,'' he said. ''They're isolating source code so you don't have access to the main tree.''   When young Russian technologists first arrive in San Francisco, the person they often text is the investor Nicholas Davidov. Mr. Davidov, 30, said he was part of what he called the New Wave, which is a group of Russian founders and engineers who came over to Silicon Valley in the last few years. They gather at a Russian immigrant-owned bar in San Francisco, Rum & Sugar, and every Wednesday at a smoke shop in Redwood City, Calif., where they share stories.   Most of the comments that Mr. Davidov and his friends now get are couched as jokes, he said.   ''Somebody announced me on one of the conferences where I was speaking and said, 'I invited Nick because I wanted to collude with Russians,' '' he said. ''Just a lot of jokes.''   Mr. Davidov is an investor in Wallarm, a cybersecurity firm based in San Francisco. He attributes Wallarm's double-digit growth this year directly to the peculiar reputation that has come from the election-influence campaign and the fact that the company's founders are Russian.   Ivan Novikov, 29, a co-founder and the chief executive of Wallarm, was less enthusiastic about how news of Russian interference in the election has affected his life.   ''Technically, any Russian who works in I.T. is a hacker, so we're all 'Russian hackers,' and a lot of people like to mention it, but it's not so funny when it's 10 times per day or 10 times per party,'' he said. ''We definitely don't like this hype about it.''   Some Russian-born entrepreneurs said they had noticed no change in how they were treated. Stanislav Shalunov, a co-founder of Open Garden, which develops peer-to-peer mesh networking software, said he hadn't experienced anything different.   ''With all this hacking news, I don't think anyone alleges anyone from the Russian tech community in the U.S. is engaged in it,'' he said. ''And it's pretty obvious that lots of people from Russia are getting hired.''   Back at what may only briefly be known as the Hack Temple (investors want a new name before it officially opens), two young Russian entrepreneurs made breakfast sandwiches in the rectory kitchen one morning last week. The building has eight bedrooms, some with bunks to fit up to four; a living room full of Midcentury Modern sofas; and a patio covered in artificial turf and often used for beer pong. Before Mr. Cherkashin bought the building in January 2016, it was Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe Church.   In the cavernous nave, the stained-glass saints were covered in gauzy panels to soften the religious feel. Volunteers have fixed the broken organ so it plays again, now for parties.   ''If there would be a city in the world where you can go to church and a hackers' house,'' Mr. Cherkashin said, ''it would only be this one.''   On the wall along one of the aisles, Evgeniy Lapchenko, the Ukrainian artist, has remade Hieronymus Bosch's ''Garden of Earthly Delights.'' Among the twisted human figures are tech luminaries: the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs taking a selfie, revelers at Burning Man and Mr. Brin of Google in a self-driving car.   As for rebranding Hack Temple, Mr. Cherkashin hasn't found a new name he likes.   ''It can be called the Start-Up Temple,'' he said. ''But it's just too boring.''

"Questions, and Some Answers, On the Dreaded Equifax Breach","You had some questions. Dozens, actually. They arrived in more than 2,000 email and Twitter messages since Equifax disclosed to the world on Sept. 7 that hackers may have stolen over 140 million Social Security numbers. Never in my 24 years of reporting have so many people expressed so much confusion about a single piece of news that I've covered.   Aggravation and outrage were the prevailing emotions, given that there is no easy way to avoid having Equifax (and its siblings in oligopoly, Experian and TransUnion) track and judge our behavior and dictate the terms of our financial lives. I'm angry, too, and since the first day of this mess, I've been flinging questions at the company and waiting days or weeks for what are often half answers. All along, I've been updating a running list of what I'm learning from Equifax (and from you) at nytimes.com/ yourmoney. One important piece of news from this week: A few readers who have frozen their credit file at Equifax (more about that below) have told me that they now have trouble temporarily lifting it. I had the same experience this week. The company refused to answer questions about this, even though this puts people in jeopardy of not being able to apply for new jobs or mortgages. This ought to be a giant red alert to the bankers who have mostly hidden out since the breach: If your customers can't unfreeze their credit files, it's going to be hard to do business with them. Perhaps some banker in a position of authority ought to have a word with Equifax about its callous disregard for people who are merely trying to protect themselves. If you're just beginning to digest the breach and its ramifications and figure out what to do, the information below should get you started. The online version is longer, filled with links to the sites and tools I mention, and has more information for people who can't access Equifax's broken systems. What's Happened? How do I know if I've been affected by the Equifax breach? Equifax has a website where you can check. But even if you come up clean, it's a good idea to freeze your credit anyway. Why? When a thief shows up with your Social Security number and address to apply for credit in your name, the lender will try to fetch your credit report before anything else happens. If it can't retrieve the report because of the freeze, then no new account for the thief. What did the thieves actually steal?? According to the company, thieves took names, Social Security numbers, birth dates and addresses for up to 145.5 million people. What Should I Do About It? How do I freeze my credit file? You can -- and you should -- set up a freeze on the websites of all three credit bureaus. There may be fees associated with doing it. Don't trust the security of the companies' sites? Try calling them instead. EQUIFAX 1-800-685-1111 EXPERIAN 1-888-397-3742 TRANSUNION 1-888-909-8872 Why freeze at all three bureaus? Because thieves might take stolen data and apply for credit at a lender that only checks Experian or TransUnion files. If you haven't frozen those, then you're vulnerable. If you're married, both you and your spouse should freeze your files. Freezes at Equifax are free through January. Why not make them free for life? The company would not directly address this question. So Much of This Does Not Seem Sensible or Easy. Why? Why didn't Equifax make its credit freezes free the moment it announced the breach? The company sent me a response to this question that did not actually answer the question. Why not have frozen files be the default for all people? Equifax has repeatedly dodged this question. Why not coordinate with Experian and TransUnion so that consumers can get one year of freezes or locks for life at all three companies? Equifax won't answer this one directly, either. TransUnion has a $19.95-permonth monitoring service that lets you lock your TransUnion and Equifax files. Experian said that because ''not all locks are created equal,'' it would be hard to create a one-stop locking shop. Why are people running into technical problems when PINs are supposed to appear on their screens after they get an Equifax freeze? ''Our technology team is aware of some limited situations in which consumers are unable to view their PINs,'' the company said in an emailed statement. I do not believe the problems to be ''limited,'' given the volume of my mail. If you request a security freeze online, the PIN shows up on the screen only. The company said it does not currently email the PIN as a follow-up or send it via United States mail. If you request a security freeze over the phone, Equifax said it will mail you your PIN. Didn't get your PIN at all? Equifax said you can call 866-349-5191 to get it. If people are having problems with Equifax's various websites, where is the best place to call to reach someone who actually knows what they are talking about? According to the company, the best number to dial for help is 1-866-447- 7559. Some readers have had trouble getting good information from the above number and say they found success with these: â-  865-410-8643 â-  888-548-7878 ''We have worked hard to improve the experience with our call centers,'' an Equifax spokesman said. I'm having trouble getting Experian to accept my freeze request online or by phone, and they want me to send them a bunch of personal information by mail. Are they doing this on purpose to discourage me from getting a freeze in the first place? This is for your own protection! Or so said Experian, in a statement: ''When we are unable to sufficiently match identification online or by telephone, we request additional documentation in order to verify the individual's identity. We do so as an additional precaution in an effort to protect the consumer.'' Was Equifax deliberately throttling back its website to try to keep people from getting freezes? No, the company told me. What Is This About 'Locking' Instead of 'Freezing'? What are these locking services that Equifax, Experian and TransUnion offer? How are they different from freezes? Locking has the same effect as freezing, so no new lender or company will be able to check a file whether it's locked or frozen. But there may be differences in processes, restrictions and fees. The glass-half-full crowd will note that unlocking your file doesn't require the random PIN that comes with a frozen file. The glass-half-empty people will note TransUnion's requirement that you waive legal rights and Experian's high fees. Equifax's TrustedID Premier service includes a one-year lock but not a permanent freeze. For more, see my columns on Sept. 27 and Oct. 4. Lots of people who have registered for Equifax's credit lock via its TrustedID Premier service have not received confirmations. Are they ever going to get them? ''We assure you we are working diligently to send confirmation information as quickly as possible, and apologize to the consumers who have not yet received their confirmation emails,'' the company said. Many people who finally do get the emails click on the activation link and land on a webpage that doesn't work. Should they just keep trying? ''We are making the navigation easier to understand and eliminating steps in the enrollment process and investing in technology that allows more people to register faster,'' the company said in a statement. Why is Equifax sending people activation emails with links inside them? Every bit of advice we get on security says to never click a link that is inside an email. This is in case the email came from a hacker masquerading as a trusted source and the link is going to harvest information from you in some way. Equifax, however, says that the ''emails and links have been designed with security in mind.'' I signed up for a free Equifax lock for a year through the TrustedID Premier program. Once a year is up, will I automatically be switched into the recently announced free-lock-for-life program that begins Jan. 31, 2018? The company has not figured it out yet. Will Equifax force people to submit to mandatory arbitration or some other loss of privileges or rights in exchange for the new offer of free credit locks for life? The company has not answered this question so far. Equifax has said that the new locks will be free for life. Do the contracts specify what happens in case the company is purchased by a private equity firm, sold off for parts and/or renamed? The company has not answered this yet. What's the Best Way to Push Back Against Equifax? I'd like to punish Equifax by joining a class-action suit. How do I do that? There is no need to join, according to Stuart Rossman, director of litigation at the National Consumer Law Center. There will be an eventual consolidation of all the federal suits against the company and any person whose information ended up with the thieves will eventually be eligible for any award. He warns that recoveries tend to be quite small. I'd like to punish Equifax through the legislative process. How might this happen? Members of Congress have proposed a variety of solutions, but movement in this industry has historically happened in state legislatures. Contact your state representatives and ask them about legislation that would force the three credit bureaus to provide free credit freezes or locks for life, with free temporary lifts as well. How Else Should I React and Protect Myself? Why can't I just get a new Social Security number? The Social Security Administration will allow it only in limited circumstances, and mere annoyance or existential fear over the Equifax breach doesn't cut it. I'm worried about someone using my data to file tax returns in my name and commit refund fraud, which would keep me from getting my legitimate refund. Can I do anything to stop it? File returns early to get ahead of thieves who may try to beat you to it. Some people are eligible to receive personal identification numbers from the Internal Revenue Service, which you'd have to include with your taxes to get your refund. For now, they are available only to people in places with high instances of fraud, like Florida, Georgia and the District of Columbia. Victims of identity theft are also eligible to get a PIN if they fill out an affidavit, but the I.R.S. won't give them out if your only claim is being a victim of a breach like Equifax's. I'm worried about someone using my data to establish a Social Security Administration online account in my name and claiming my benefits. Can I do anything to stop it? Yes. If you have a freeze on your credit files, you'll need to temporarily lift it before setting up your Social Security online account. This is not clear to people using the site, to the great annoyance of the customer service representative I spoke with on the phone after waiting on hold for 45 minutes. (She gets a lot of calls about this issue, she said.) Want to protect yourself further? You can block online access altogether. This is reversible, but you'll have to contact the Social Security Administration for help when you're ready. How can people protect their children? The nasty problem of child identity theft has been around for a while, and I wrote a column about it in 2015. Equifax's response to my breach-related questions so far has been illogical, noting that it doesn't ''typically'' maintain credit files on minors. If that's true, however, then why did so many parents who put their children's Social Security numbers into Equifax's ''Am I Impacted?'' site find that their child ''may'' have been? If that's the case, then parents need answers to their questions. If not, the website isn't working. The company has not addressed this question over a couple of weeks now, and instead it asks people to call the very same customer service agents who have proven themselves to be consistently unhelpful. No, thanks. Instead, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion all have their own baroque processes that parents can use to figure out if a child has a credit file (I've linked to them online) and if so, if anything bad has happened to it. Some states let you freeze a child's file, while others don't. The National Conference of State Legislatures maintains a state-by-state guide on its website. Can I delete my Equifax credit file, so that I don't have to worry about them setting any more of my data loose on the world? The company refused to answer when I wrote a column about this question. But for those who can bear the risk of not having an Equifax file (including potentially running into trouble with mortgage lenders who may want a look at credit reports from all three bureaus), it sure seems like a wish that Equifax ought to grant. And if it won't, perhaps state or federal legislators should take up the question.     "
The C.I.A.'s Fake News,"Kenneth Osgood is a professor of history at the Colorado School of Mines. Russia's crafty campaign to hack the 2016 election may seem unprecedented, but in a way it's not. Sure, secret agents and front groups have hacked email systems, dumped documents on WikiLeaks, paid an army of internet trolls and spent thousands buying political ads on social media. It all seems new because the technologies are new. But it's not the first time a government tried to mess with our heads by manipulating our media. In fact, for more than two decades during the Cold War, the public was bombarded by an enormous publicity campaign to shape American views of Russia and its foreign policy. Advertisements appeared on every TV network, on radio stations across the country and in hundreds of newspapers. The campaign may have been the largest and most consistent source of political advertising in American history. And it was orchestrated by a big, powerful intelligence service: the Central Intelligence Agency.     It all began as a cover story. As the Cold War was getting underway, the C.I.A. wanted to take the fight into Russia's backyard. So, in 1950, it created Radio Free Europe, a government-sponsored broadcasting station. Ostensibly, it provided unbiased news for Eastern Europeans, but in fact the agency used it to wage a subversive campaign to weaken Communist governments behind the Iron Curtain.   But how to hide the agency's hand? How to account for the millions of C.I.A. dollars pouring into the broadcasting station? Simple: pretend that ordinary Americans are paying the bills.   The C.I.A.'s freewheeling spymaster, Frank Wisner, created a well-heeled and well-connected front group, the National Committee for a Free Europe. Each year it ran an enormous fund-raising campaign called the Crusade for Freedom (later renamed the Radio Free Europe Fund) that implored Americans to donate ''freedom dollars'' to combat Kremlin lies, complete with annual appeals resembling a hybrid of World War II war bond campaigns and contemporary NPR pledge drives.   Every president from Harry Truman to Richard Nixon endorsed the campaign. So did hundreds of governors, mayors, celebrities, editors and executives. Entertainers like Ronald Reagan, Rock Hudson, Jerry Lewis and the Kingston Trio pleaded for donations on radio and television. The Hollywood producers Darryl Zanuck and Cecil B. DeMille amplified those messages, as did powerful media figures like Bill Paley, the president of CBS; C. D. Jackson, the publisher of Fortune; and the media mogul Henry Luce. Even newspaper delivery boys played a part, soliciting donations from subscribers on their paper routes.   Then there was the Ad Council, the same industry organization that turned Smokey Bear into a cultural icon. The council sponsored the crusade as a public service, arranging for broadcasters to run ads without charge. The Ad Council's sponsorship translated into as much as $2 billion worth of free advertising over the campaign's history, in 2017 dollars.   The message was simple: Russia was aggressive; Communism was awful. The enemy couldn't be trusted. Typical ads conveyed a brutalized vision of life behind the Iron Curtain: ''a strip of Communist-controlled hell-on-earth,'' one read. Donating a few bucks would save Czechs, Poles, Hungarians and others from this tyranny. Many thousands of Americans took the bait. They dutifully wrote checks to Radio Free Europe, and their contributions were magnified by gifts from many of the country's biggest corporations, yielding, on average, about $1 million annually.   It wasn't enough: The donations barely covered the cost of running the ''fund-raising drives,'' to say nothing of Radio Free Europe's $30 million annual budgets. But that wasn't the point.   Declassified documents reveal that almost from the start, the C.I.A. saw that it could exploit the fund-raising campaign as a conduit for domestic propaganda. It was a way to rally public support for the Cold War by dramatizing Communist repression and stoking fears of a worldwide menace. The plight of Eastern Europe brought moral clarity to the Cold War, and it cemented the region as a vital national interest in American domestic politics.   Its impact outlived the campaign itself. Even though the pleas for donations ended in 1971, when the C.I.A. was exposed and stopped funding the station, they cemented anti-Communist hostility that animated conservative opposition to détente in the 1970s. It provided the leitmotif for Reagan's denunciations of the ''evil empire'' in the 1980s. One can even hear echoes in Donald Trump's recent speech to the United Nations: His long digression on the evils of socialism seems drawn from the heated rhetoric of ads gone by.   So, too, does our post-truth media environment carry voices from this past. The crusade blasted all information from enemy sources as lies and deceit -- fake news, we could say. This counter-propaganda sought to inoculate the public from being receptive to anything said by the other side. It's a tactic we've seen play out in real time on the president's Twitter feed.   And almost certainly, Radio Free Europe itself -- which continues to operate out of its headquarters in Prague -- has shaped Vladimir Putin's worldview. Russia has long tried to claim Eastern Europe as its sphere of influence. Moscow hated the station for its meddling. As a K.G.B. officer, Mr. Putin no doubt spent many hours fretting over its activities in the Soviet bloc. It was a major irritant. He may even see the 2016 election hack as a way to even the score. If so, it's payback indeed.   Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.      "
What Is the 'Russia Story'?,"Confused by all the news about Russia and the 2016 presidential election? We are here to help.  In late 2016, top United States intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government directed a massive cyberattack aimed at denying Hillary Clinton the presidency and putting Donald J. Trump in the White House. This broad campaign included hacking and leaking Democratic emails, pushing false information on Russian media outlets, gaining access to state and local electoral boards, and using social media to disseminate misinformation. President Trump and his advisers have been dogged by revelations of undisclosed meetings, emails and phone calls between Russian officials and people connected to Mr. Trump during the campaign and presidential transition.   Some of Mr. Trump's senior advisers denied knowing about any contacts with Russia. But new information indicates that several of them were aware of discussions, according to court documents and reporting. It was also recently revealed that Donald Trump Jr. exchanged private messages on Twitter with WikiLeaks, the antisecrecy group that published Democratic emails stolen by Russian hackers. Here are some of the ways Mr. Trump may have interfered in the criminal and congressional investigations, according to ethics and legal experts:  Mr. Trump admitted he was thinking about the investigation of the F.B.I. when he fired its director, James B. Comey.  Mr. Comey testified under oath that Mr. Trump asked him to drop the investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. Mr. Trump has denied he pressured Mr. Comey.  Mr. Trump urged senior Senate Republicans, including the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to end the panel's investigation.  Mr. Trump may have helped write Donald Trump Jr.'s initial response to inquiries about a meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer -- a response he could have known was misleading.     "
The D.N.C. Hack Was Just the Start,"Robby Mook managed , Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for president. Imagine the headlines if, in 2015, Russian agents had leapt out of a van at 2 a.m. in Southeast Washington and broken into the Democratic National Committee offices using sophisticated tools and techniques to steal tens of thousands of documents, including the names and Social Security numbers of donors and employees, and confidential memorandums about campaign strategy for the presidential election. The world would have been aghast. It would have been, people would say, worse than Watergate.     Something similar did, in fact, happen at the D.N.C. two years ago, and it was worse than Watergate. This wasn't just one party spying on the other; these were hackers under orders from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia who were trying to ''undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process,'' according to a report released Friday by the office of the director of national intelligence. But the immediate reaction to the break-in was nothing like what followed Watergate.   That's because most of us don't think of hacking as a crime like breaking and entering. Before the D.N.C. break-in, I thought of hacking as a prank by mischievous tech-savvy people to get revenge. When North Koreans hacked Sony Pictures in 2014 in retaliation for making the satire ''The Interview,'' I was much more disturbed by the embarrassing things the movie executives said in emails to one another than by how easy it was for a dictator to punish critics in the United States. It wasn't until I lived through the Russian hackings of Democratic staff members and organizations that I realized how dangerous such an attitude could be.   I saw it firsthand in July, when I was asked about the first wave of stolen documents on ABC's ''This Week'' and CNN's ''State of the Union.'' I thought it was a bombshell -- Russians hacked into the Democratic National Committee! -- but my alarm was dismissed by the news media and our opponents as merely campaign spin, feigned distress meant to dodge real questions about how the embarrassing messages might hurt Hillary Clinton's prospects.   This perception has to change. I'm not referring to the D.N.C. incident in particular, but about cybercrimes in general. Unless we realize how vulnerable we are, we are playing into the hands of foreign aggressors like Mr. Putin.   The chilling effect of these attacks can be very public, and very personal. But they can also be more subtle, impeding dialogue within an organization. For all the fanfare we give the internet for freeing speech, when it is weaponized against you, it can also be used to stifle speech. At the D.N.C., certain conversations could take place only on an encrypted phone app, which made communicating more complicated logistically.   Skeptics, including President-elect Donald J. Trump, have compared the hacks to leaks to the news media. They're not the same. A leak occurs when someone who is authorized to have information gives it to a reporter without authorization. The ''Access Hollywood'' video of Mr. Trump talking about assaulting women was a leak. When someone on my staff shared a memo about our campaign launch without permission, that was a leak. Leaks are frustrating, and they happen all the time.   What Mr. Putin did by dumping Democrats' emails wasn't a leak; it was an attack with stolen information.   Until we start to see these situations in this light, ''Moscow's longstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order,'' as the national intelligence office report called it, will remain potent, and the democratic process will remain vulnerable. The news media needs to spend at least as much time reporting on the source of these foreign-led cybercrimes as they do on the contents.   This isn't a partisan issue, as Republican senators like John McCain and Lindsey  Graham  have already made clear. Mr. Putin and Kim Jong-un of North Korea aren't registered Democrats or Republicans -- they're anti-American, and they want to hurt democracy itself. To justify what Mr. Putin did, or to blame the victim, as Mr.  Trump and his staff have chosen to do, simply leaves them, and all of us, under threat, because the next attack may be aimed not at a political party, but at the White House or the Pentagon.   Of course, Americans need to do a better job protecting ourselves. Law enforcement needs to create better bridges between the intelligence services that monitor attacks and the individuals and organizations they affect. There are very few protocols for the F.B.I. and C.I.A. to alert and assist potential victims. Our democratic structures -- elections equipment and officials, elected officials and candidates, activists and reporters -- must be elevated as a priority.   At the time of the D.N.C. attack, water treatment plants, nuclear power plants and even casinos were on the Department of Homeland Security's ''critical infrastructure'' list. Voting equipment was added last Friday, but we must do much more to protect the people who animate our democratic process. Imagine how stolen information could be (or already has been) used to influence or corrupt officeholders, or voters themselves.   Watergate inspired greater vigilance in the press and prompted major reforms to safeguard our democratic institutions. We need to do that again.

Democrats Confront F.B.I. Chief During an Intelligence Briefing,"WASHINGTON -- America's intelligence chiefs sat down with members of Congress behind closed doors on Friday for what they thought would be a straightforward briefing on Russian cyberattacks. What ensued instead was a confrontation Democrats have long sought with James B. Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Why, the House Democrats demanded to know, did Mr. Comey believe it was O.K. to make repeated disclosures during the campaign about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails but to this day refuse to say if the F.B.I. is investigating links between the Trump campaign and Russia?     His answers did not prove very satisfying. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, grew so frustrated that at one point she chastised Mr. Comey for being ''condescending to members.''   Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who was chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee when it was hacked, asked why Mr. Comey had never called her about the intrusions, which began in August 2015 and continued over the course of many months. The F.B.I. notified the committee of the original hacking, but reached a low-level tech support contractor and went back and forth with him for months before the leadership of the organization was informed and took steps to halt the intrusion.   The committee and the bureau have blamed each other for the delay, and the pattern continued on Friday, according to multiple Democrats in the meeting.   Afterward, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, called the tenor of the exchanges ''contentious at times.''   ''I don't want to go into the contents of what were discussed,'' Mr. Schiff said. But ''a great many members are concerned with whether the director has employed a double standard.''   The hearing took place a day after the Justice Department's inspector general said it was investigating Mr. Comey's decision during the campaign to hold a news conference announcing the end of the case -- and then, just before the election, inform Congress there was possible new evidence only to say days later that it did not amount to anything.   Mr. Comey ''didn't really answer,'' said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York. He dismissively referred to Mr. Comey as ''a policeman,'' and added, ''I don't remember anything substantive he said.''   The reaction to the assessment by intelligence agencies that Russia sought to promote the candidacy of Donald J. Trump has been mixed. Mr. Trump has seen it as undermining his electoral victory and ridiculed the agencies, accusing them this week of using leaks to discredit him after it briefed him on a dossier of unsubstantiated reports of compromising personal information the Russians allegedly collected.   But on Friday, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and the panel's vice chairman, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, announced that the committee would hold hearings on the Russian activity and its effect on the election.   Before Russians were an issue, there was the F.B.I. investigation into whether Mrs. Clinton or her aides mishandled classified information that was in emails on a private server she was using.   Mr. Comey discussed the investigation and sharply criticized Mrs. Clinton at a news conference announcing that no charges would be brought against her. He also wrote two letters near the end of the campaign that Clinton supporters say cost her the election. But Mr. Comey has not publicly commented on whether there are any open investigations of Mr. Trump or anyone associated with his campaign.   Democrats said the closest Mr. Comey came on Friday to offering an explanation for his actions was to say he would only disclose an ongoing investigation if the public had an overwhelming need to know about it or if it was obvious there was one underway. He said he did not believe any possible investigation into Trump or his associates met either standard.   The F.B.I.'s position is that it does not discuss counterintelligence investigations that could compromise important methods and sources.   Speaking to reporters afterward, Ms. Pelosi said that ''really, the American people are owed the truth.''   ''There is a great deal of evidence to say that this is an issue of high interest to the American people,'' she continued. ''For that reason, the F.B.I. should let us know whether they're doing that investigation or not. They're usually inscrutable.''   The F.B.I. declined to comment on the meeting.   Mr. Nadler said he thought Mr. Comey should have been fired ''months ago.'' Other Democrats, perhaps concerned about who Mr. Trump would name to replace Mr. Comey, either said that he should remain on the job or that they were still unsure.   The meeting in the auditorium of the Capitol's visitor center was standing room only. Some Republicans unsurprisingly had a different reaction.   ''Their questions and comments seemed to make the case that Hillary Clinton would be president if it were not for hacking,'' Representative Steve King of Iowa said.   Mr. King left the meeting unconvinced about the Russian hacking, which the intelligence chiefs did manage to discuss amid the questions about Mr. Comey's conduct.   The congressman added that he thought ''some'' intelligence officials were trustworthy. But ''not all. People there need to be rooted out,'' he said without elaborating.

Pakistan's missing bloggers,"Raza Rumi, who teaches at Ithaca College and the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs, is a consulting editor for The Friday Times, a weekly in Pakistan, and the author of ''The Fractious Path: Pakistan's Democratic Transition.'' Since Jan. 4, at least five bloggers and activists have disappeared in Pakistan. Perhaps the best known is Salman Haider, a poet and academic who has been a vocal opponent of religious extremism and the Pakistani authorities' abuse of opposition activists. The others who have vanished had the courage to critique organized religion, the influence of clerics in Pakistan and the country's powerful military on social media. Throughout Pakistan's history, dissent and free speech have been muzzled by a state that inherited a repressive legal framework from the British colonizers who ruled the Indian subcontinent until 1947. Journalists, poets, intellectuals and many politicians who questioned the state were labeled traitors, sometimes jailed or exiled, and on occasion killed. Almost every Pakistani government -- military or civilian -- has tried to control and manipulate the news media.     That kind of control has become more difficult as print and electronic media have expanded in the past decade and a half. Since the deregulation of electronic media in 2002, Pakistan has gone from three to 89 television channels. The state's monopoly of the airwaves is over. Noisy talk shows regularly challenge the elected governments and their policies. But when it comes to the military, journalists and commentators are cautious, often indulging in self-censorship. Laws governing freedom of speech and the news media are vague, and their enforcement is arbitrary; critics are often accused of endangering national security.   The rise of social media and blogs has further expanded the space for dissent. Pakistanis can say on Facebook things they still could not get away with on television or in print. The missing activists, for example, were allegedly affiliated with satirical Facebook pages that ridiculed the hypocrisy of religious clerics and the flawed state policies of using jihad to further foreign policy goals.   Last year, the Parliament passed a draconian cybercrimes law curtailing digital freedoms. This law grants the government overarching powers to control and block information that state officials find offensive, examine and retain users' data, and impose harsh penalties for a variety of offenses. The law builds on the narrow definition of freedom of speech that the Constitution guarantees in principle but with a number of exceptions that include ''glory of Islam,'' ''the integrity, security or defense of Pakistan'' and ''public order, decency or morality,'' among others. Such ambiguous terms are easily invoked to suppress dissent.   After the enactment of the cybercrime law, Pakistan's intelligence agencies reportedly asked for legal cover to take pre-emptive ''action'' against people they believed were breaching national security. This demand was accepted. It is unclear whether the five bloggers and social media activists have disappeared under this arrangement. In fact, there is no information from any official source. But there is good reason to be worried.   In recent years, hundreds of suspected insurgents from the southwestern province of Baluchistan and religious militants from other parts of the country have allegedly been picked up by security agencies, never to be heard from again. A government commission is handling at least 1,129 cases of ''missing'' persons.   Even if the five activists reappear, they will face the wrath of zealots who want instant justice for blasphemers. In recent days, right-wing social media users and pundits have been smearing the missing men as blasphemers. In addition, they have been accused in absentia by conservative sections of the Pakistani media and right-wing trolls as pawns of foreign powers (read India, the eternal enemy) who are waging an information war against Pakistan.   The exact relationship between these right-wing loudmouths and the security services remains, as ever in Pakistan, murky. But these activists' lives are most likely in danger. In 2011, a police guard killed Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab Province, because he had publicly defended a Christian woman sentenced to death under the blasphemy law, a law he said needed to be reformed.   By cracking down on people opining on social media, Pakistan joins Turkey, Bangladesh, China and other countries where journalists and activists are hounded by the state and by extremists. Pakistan's elites, both civilian and military, frequently complain that their country has an image problem. Such disappearances certainly don't help. Moreover, in an interconnected world, such moves are counterproductive. The elected government of Pakistan must be held accountable for such brazen curtailment of rights. The Parliament needs to review the scope of internet freedoms as well as reconsider the nebulous guarantee of free speech provided by the Constitution.   The international community should help, too. It can remind the Pakistani government of its obligations under the United Nations Convention against Torture and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to put an end to enforced disappearances. In its 2015 compliance report on the civil rights covenant, the government stated that it was ''firmly committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.'' It is time to move beyond lip service. Upholding freedom of speech will only bolster Pakistan's fragile democracy.

"Messages About iMessages, but Not From Apple","Q. I got an email on my iPhone from ''Apple iMessages'' saying my user name and password had been used to log into an iPhone 6. I do have an iPhone 6, but if this is spam, how do they know? I am temporarily ignoring this, but what do I do now?  A. For years, online criminals have tried variations of the account-security email for Apple's iMessages, iTunes and iCloud services to lure recipients into clicking on malicious links or providing Apple ID account information. By including the name of the iPhone model in the message, the sender is hoping to get your attention with specifics. Adding the name of a model still in widespread use broadens the potential audience for the message.    Even if the return address on the message says it is from Apple (or one of its services), you can usually see the account it really came from by tapping the sender's name in the message header. The next screen shows the actual address.

"Fearful of Hacking, Dutch Will Count Ballots by Hand","Follow Sewell Chan on Twitter @sewellchan . Concerned about the role hackers and false news might have played in the United States election, the Dutch government announced on Wednesday that all ballots in next month's elections would be counted by hand. The decision to forgo electronic counting is a stark response to warnings that outside actors, including Russia, might try to tamper with pivotal elections this year in the Netherlands, France and Germany -- three major democracies in which establishment parties are facing pressure from right-wing populism of the kind that fueled Britain's vote to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump's triumph in the United States election.    ''The cabinet cannot exclude the possibility that state actors might gain advantage from influencing political decision-making and public opinion in the Netherlands and might use means to try and achieve such influence,'' Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk said in a statement. ''We're talking about actors that both have the intention and ability to do this.''    Parliament recently discussed the finding by intelligence agencies that the Russian government tried covertly to help Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump's allegations -- made without evidence -- that millions of undocumented immigrants had cast ballots, costing him the popular vote.   Ronald Van Raak, an opposition member for the Socialist Party, demanded guarantees from Mr. Plasterk that the Dutch elections, set for March 15, would not be hacked -- and said that if the government could not provide such a guarantee, it should resort to paper ballots.   In a report on Monday, the broadcaster RTL concluded that the Dutch election would be ''easy to hack,'' citing interviews with experts and an in-depth investigation of the vote-tallying software the nation has used since 2009.   On Wednesday, Mr. Plasterk said the government was looking into the electoral system's vulnerability to fraud, but was taking pre-emptive action to remove ''any shadow of a doubt'' about electoral integrity. So it will abandon the use of computer technology for vote tallying. Voting in the Netherlands, a nation of 17 million, will occur the old-fashioned way: Voters will use red pencils to mark paper ballots, which will be hand-counted in each voting precinct and then tallied across the nation's 20 voting districts. The results are then submitted to the central voting office and the nation's electoral council.   Herbert Bos, a computer scientist at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam and an expert on election integrity, said it was essential that the country maintain a voter-verifiable paper audit trail, to allow voters to ascertain that their vote was cast correctly and to allow the checking of the stored electronic results.   ''In the Netherlands the whole system was frighteningly insecure,'' Mr. Bos said in an email. Although the country still uses paper ballots, ''the rest of the chain, from the polling stations all the way to the announcement of the final election results,'' has been ''completely computerized'' since 2008, he said.   ''You did not even need to be super sophisticated to manipulate the counts,'' Mr. Bos said. ''Could a foreign country such as Russia, China or indeed any advanced state do this? Oh yes. Easily. Will the decision to pull the plug on the computerized vote counting improve integrity? Yes. You need manual counting and a paper trail that is checked.''   He added: ''Election results are the heart of our democracy. You cannot risk any of this. Even if the vulnerabilities were small, you do not want to take any chances. And in this case they were not small. And there were many.'' As for elections since 2008, Mr. Bos said he could not be certain that no tampering had occurred.   Kees Verhoeven, a member of Parliament for D66, a centrist party that supports marijuana legalization, welcomed the government's decision but said that Mr. Plasterk should have acted sooner. ''The elections will be held in six weeks, and only now the minister sees that the software is not secure,'' Mr. Verhoeven said, adding that election integrity is at ''the core of our democracy.''

"In an Age of Cybercrime, Low-Tech Thieves Target Mailboxes","Email: dwyer@nytimes.comTwitter: @jimdwyernyt The streets of Upper Manhattan were quiet, but a police officer saw two men standing in front of a blue mailbox at Broadway and Academy Street. It was around 1:30 a.m., Jan. 17.    One of the men was holding a plastic bottle, which was tied to a string. While his partner stood lookout, the other man lowered the bottle into the mailbox, as if he were feeding a line off a pier, played the string a bit, then pulled it out.   Four pieces of mail were stuck to the bottle.    When the police officer stepped forward, the two men took off, leaving behind the plastic bottle. They were quickly caught. The mail was stuck on the bottle with glue.   ''Such devices are commonly used to obtain mail from inside of mailboxes,'' Officer Vito Guagenti said in a criminal complaint.   This may be the age of cybercrime, but in some New York neighborhoods crooks are on a spree of fishing old-fashioned snail mail out of street corner mailboxes, using decidedly low-tech tools like plastic bottles, glue and string.   Or, as in another case in Upper Manhattan, a glue trap like those typically used to catch mice.   Some thieves wash the ink off the checks they snare and change the payees' names. Others make trouble by using the account information.   Over the last year or so, the police and postal inspectors made about 150 arrests in the Bronx on charges of mail fishing, according to Donna Harris, a spokeswoman in New York for the United States Postal Inspection Service.   ''We've been keeping this low profile,'' she said. After realizing that ''we weren't going to arrest our way out of the problem,'' Ms. Harris said, the postal authorities started changing the Bronx street mailboxes to make them harder to pilfer.   Like fishing fleets that go where the schools are running, the mail thieves seemed to have pulled anchor in the Bronx and sailed to northern Manhattan. Since October, 14 arrests have been made there, Ms. Harris said.   The crime wave had little chance of staying low profile, thanks to social media and reporting by the news website DNAinfo. Residents have taped warnings on the boxes after finding coatings of glue, or double-side tape.   Laurie Piette was walking her dog one morning in November in the Inwood neighborhood and spotted an envelope addressed to Con Edison that was stuck to a mouse glue trap. The envelope had been torn open, but the return address was legible. She posted an inquiry on Facebook.   Eventually, word got to the sender, Helen M. Churko, who had mailed her Con Edison bill and check a few days earlier.   A picture of the torn envelope stuck to the mouse glue trap was posted online.   ''It was a great photograph,'' Ms. Churko said, but shocking. ''Literally the minute I stopped getting hysterical, I called my bank and told them what was going on.''   With electronic payment available for many bills, you might think that the pickings would be slim for mailbox thieves. But particularly in parts of Inwood and along Fort Washington Avenue in Washington Heights, older residents are more likely to use checks to pay their bills by mail.   For her part, Ms. Churko said she wrote checks because she was on computers all day at work. ''I'm old school when it comes to things like money,'' she said. ''There are too many stories about cybertheft and identity theft.''   Also, many landlords do not accept electronic payment. A few days into January, Andrew Graham dropped his rent check into a mailbox at Broadway and Dongan Place. He got a call from his bank. Someone had taken the check and written another name over the landlord's. ''Whoever's committing fraud in this way is really looking for unbanked folks who are mailing out money orders or cash,'' he said.   Barbara Kennedy mailed her rent check in a box at Fort Washington Avenue and 183rd Street after the last pickup on Dec. 28. The next morning, she saw the mailbox had been pried open and emptied. She stopped payment. ''I put two posts on Facebook to alert people,'' Ms. Kennedy said.   People are being advised not to deposit mail after the last pickup of the day or on weekends. ''That lets it sit in the box overnight,'' said Ms. Harris of the postal inspectors. (She said to report suspicious activity to 212-330-2400 or 911.)   The Police Department also advised using gel ink, which is harder to wash off.   ''We're supposed to write our checks with indelible ink?'' Ms. Churko said. ''This ticks me off even more.''     "
Love for Leaks Quickly Faded After Election,"WASHINGTON -- As a candidate for president, Donald J. Trump embraced the hackers who had leaked Hillary Clinton's emails to the press, declaring at a rally in Pennsylvania, ''I love WikiLeaks!'' To the cheering throngs that night, Mr. Trump marveled that ''nothing is secret today when you talk about the internet.'' The leakers, he said, had performed a public service by revealing what he called a scandal with no rival in United States history.    Now, after less than four weeks in the Oval Office, President Trump has changed his mind.   At a news conference on Wednesday and in a series of Twitter postings earlier in the day, Mr. Trump angrily accused intelligence agencies of illegally leaking information about Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser, who resigned after reports that he had lied about conversations with the Russian ambassador.    ''It's a criminal action, criminal act,'' Mr. Trump fumed at the White House. In a Twitter message, he asserted that ''the real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence' like candy. Very un-American!''   But this is Washington, where leaks are common currency -- and, depending what side you're on, either sinister or patriotic. Democrats these days see the proliferation of leaks about the Trump administration as the acts of public servants revealing the misdeeds of a presidency. Republicans see them as the reckless actions of disgruntled bureaucrats eager to advance their own agendas and sabotage Mr. Trump.   Either way, Mr. Trump's presidential flip-flop follows a landmark month for Washington leaks.   Drafts of his executive orders floated around the city for days before he signed them. Parts of the president's conversations with foreign leaders have been published verbatim in news accounts. Agency memos and cables have been repeatedly cited by journalists to document anxiety among the city's civil servants.   And an endless stream of articles about the connections between Trump advisers and Russia have been generated by leaks from intelligence and law enforcement sources. There are so many, in fact, that in one article about Mr. Flynn, The Washington Post cited an unusually large number of sources, beyond the customary two: ''Nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls.''   Laura R. Handman, a lawyer who represents news organizations on First Amendment issues, said of Mr. Trump, ''He will not be the first president who has decried leaks once they become president.''   ''That does seem to be pretty much a constant in the Oval Office,'' she said. ''It's definitely true that he embraced them when the shoe was on the other foot.''   Over the last several days, leaks about Mr. Flynn and the broader issue of communications with Russia have created the president's first major scandal, forcing Mr. Flynn to step down and leading to calls on Capitol Hill for investigations.   But Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said that too little attention had been paid to how the information about Mr. Flynn was made public in the first place.   ''It was through a leak of classified information through the Department of Justice and presumably the intel community,'' Mr. Spicer said. ''Those are the only ones that have access to that information.''   ''The idea that there's been zero attention paid to an issue of that sensitivity should be concerning and alarming,'' he said.   Mr. Trump's Republican allies followed up on Mr. Spicer's lead by demanding to know who in the government has been leaking to the news media.   Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News that his committee would be ''asking the F.B.I. to do an assessment of this to tell us what's going on here, because we cannot continue to have these leaks as a government.''   Other Republicans have been circumspect about whether they intend to support investigations into the Russian connections. Some, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, support an inquiry by the intelligence committees. But Mr. McConnell has rejected the need for a select committee to investigate the issue.   ''We know how to do our work,'' Mr. McConnell said on MSNBC. ''We have an Intelligence Committee.''   In Mr. Trump's remarks at the White House, the president appeared to press for an inquiry on how information about Mr. Flynn's communications with the Russians became known publicly.   ''It's been going on for a long time before me, but now it's really going on,'' Mr. Trump said of the leaks, accusing those who spread the information of ''trying to cover up'' for Mrs. Clinton's loss in the election last year. Mr. Trump added that there were ''documents and papers that were illegally -- I stress that, illegally leaked.''   If Republicans succeed in guiding those committees to focus more on leaks -- rather than on the underlying information they reveal -- they will be following a well-worn path.   President Barack Obama, a Democrat, waged a furious war against leaks during his eight years in office, prosecuting more whistle-blowers than all of his predecessors combined.   Joel Kurtzberg, a partner at Cahill, Gordon & Reindel who specializes in First Amendment cases, said Mr. Obama's actions had served to discourage public officials from disclosing information that revealed wrongdoing or was embarrassing to the administration.   ''I would be concerned that, this early on, there is a public call to start a leak investigation, and really chill the divulgence of newsworthy information,'' Mr. Kurtzberg said. ''It is a very important thing for the press to be able to report on truthful information.''   Journalists who work in Washington are often criticized for their use of anonymous sources and for publishing information that is sensitive or classified. That criticism often comes from those in power -- which now includes Mr. Trump and his aides.   ''It's been the case in Republican and Democratic administrations that presidents have not liked it,'' said Leonard Downie Jr., a former Washington Post executive editor who is now a journalism professor at Arizona State University.   Mr. Downie said he had been surprised by the volume of information leaked to reporters in just the first three weeks of Mr. Trump's presidency, apparently from people inside the government that Mr. Trump now leads.   ''I would be concerned if this administration followed suit and began to try to punish people'' who are responsible for leaking that information or publishing it, Mr. Downie said.   For his part, the president appeared eager to do just that.   In his Twitter messages, Mr. Trump railed against the ''fake news media,'' which he accused of engaging in conspiracy theories and ''blind hatred,'' apparently directed against him or his aides.   ''Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?),'' Mr. Trump wrote in one post. ''Just like Russia.''

Verizon's Cost to Buy Yahoo Is Reduced by $350 Million,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Faced with unknown costs related to two huge data breaches, Yahoo and Verizon Communications announced Tuesday that they had agreed to shave $350 million from the price that Verizon would pay to buy Yahoo's core internet businesses. The two companies said they would also share liabilities related to the breaches, which occurred in 2013 and 2014 but were only disclosed last year after the deal was announced.     The revised agreement, now valued at $4.48 billion, paves the way for the deal to proceed to a shareholder vote as early as April, although securities regulators are still assessing how Yahoo disclosed information about the breaches to investors. Yahoo, which is winding down its own investigation of the breaches, will share more details about the incidents and their impact in the next few weeks when it makes required regulatory filings.   Yahoo reiterated on Tuesday that it still expected the deal, originally struck last July, to close by the end of June. The outlines of the new agreement were reported last week.   Consummation of the sale to Verizon would bring closure to a negotiation that has stretched on for nearly three years as Yahoo's board and its chief executive, Marissa Mayer, considered various plans to separate the company's fading internet businesses from its much more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, an affiliated company controlled by SoftBank Group.   Yahoo still faces dozens of lawsuits related to the theft of its user data. Hackers stole information, including weakly encrypted passwords, on one billion user accounts in 2013, later selling the information online. The year after, another set of hackers, which Yahoo believes were sponsored by a foreign government, stole similar information on more than 500 million accounts.   The two breaches, the largest known hacks of a private corporation, came amid infighting at Yahoo over security investments and safety measures that would inconvenience users.   Yahoo has argued that disclosure of the breaches had little effect on use of its services. In a securities filing on Tuesday, the company provided charts indicating that after the larger breach was disclosed in December, the number of pages viewed on its core sites like news and sports fell compared with the previous year. However, other measures like overall page views and the number of email messages sent and received showed no significant drop.   Verizon and Yahoo, whose internet advertising businesses are tiny compared with juggernauts like Google and Facebook, are eager to move forward on integrating their internet operations.   ''We have always believed this acquisition makes strategic sense,'' Marni M. Walden, the Verizon executive vice president who oversees product innovation and new businesses, said in a statement. ''We look forward to moving ahead expeditiously so that we can quickly welcome Yahoo's tremendous talent and assets into our expanding portfolio in the digital advertising space.''   Verizon intends to keep the Yahoo brand separate from AOL, another internet pioneer that it acquired in 2015. But executives hope to use digital advertising technology and a unified sales force to court advertisers who want to reach the companies' combined audience of well over one billion active internet users.   Yahoo still attracts large audiences to its sports, news and financial sites, and its email service retains a loyal audience. Although Yahoo and AOL do not carry the clout they had during the early days of the web, marketers do want to preserve alternatives to Google and Facebook, which increasingly dominate digital advertising.   It's unclear whether Ms. Mayer, a former Google executive who was hired as Yahoo's chief in 2012, will remain with Verizon after the deal closes. Ms. Mayer failed to turn around Yahoo's struggling internet businesses and was forced to write off much of the value of Tumblr, her biggest acquisition.   After the sale, Yahoo's Asian investments will remain in a stub company, called Altaba, which will study how to extract the maximum value from them. The Alibaba stake has a face value of about $39 billion and the Yahoo Japan stake is worth about $9 billion, but any transactions to dispose of the shares are likely to incur multibillion-dollar tax bills.

Trump Appears to Side With Assange Over Intelligence Agencies' Conclusions; Transition Briefing,""" President-elect Donald J. Trump appears to side with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over United States intelligence agencies, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence backing him up. "" She's hired: Omarosa Manigault gets a White House post, as do some notable Trump loyalists. But Mr. Trump is leaning on Republican veterans in the Oval Office's top slots. "" The president-elect finds something ""very strange"" about his intelligence briefing on Friday - even though the White House says it was always planned for Friday. President-elect sides with Assange over hacking  For the Republican Party, Mr. Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, was once purely a villain. He found little sympathy with conservatives after he leaked American military secrets from Iraq, published purloined diplomatic cables that could have gotten American sources killed and sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, fleeing charges of rape. But now, Mr. Trump appears to be siding with Mr. Assange over the conclusions of America's intelligence services. Mr. Assange appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night with Sean Hannity, one of Mr. Trump's biggest news media boosters, to declare once again that the Russians were not the source of the purloined emails that WikiLeaks released from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. [Video: Hannity Julian Assange FULL Interview 1/3/17 Watch on YouTube.] Mr. Trump followed that appearance with a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released, most likely by Thursday. There were actually two separate hackings that the Obama administration has said came from Russian intelligence - with ""100 percent"" certainty. As he has previously, Mr. Assange said: ""Our source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties."" But Mr. Assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources. It is highly unlikely that anyone approaching WikiLeaks with the emails obtained by Russian government hacking would acknowledge the source, so it is likely that Mr. Assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails. Mr. Assange and Mr. Hannity did not address that, in addition to WikiLeaks, the leaked Democratic material was published by two mysterious websites, DCLeaks.com and a blog written by someone called Guccifer 2.0. American intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by Russian agents. In addition to American intelligence agencies, most private researchers also say they believe that the D.N.C. and Podesta hackings were carried out on orders of Russian government officials, though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public. Mr. Assange's statement is unlikely to change that conclusion. Intelligence officials will brief Congress on their Russia inquiry on Thursday, ahead of a briefing for Mr. Trump in New York on Friday. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will hold the first hearing on the matter on Thursday as well. As for that ""terrible"" information mentioned by Mr. Trump, the CNN commentator Donna Brazile did send Mr. Podesta an email ahead of a Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., tipping him off that a woman in the audience would ask why the government was not doing more to help clean the city's lead-contaminated water supply. That was, in fact, reported widely and often, here and here and here and here, among other places. And that was hardly an unexpected query - for Mrs. Clinton or for her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It did cause Ms. Brazile to lose her CNN post. The president-elect appears to be getting a jump on the news. Pence backs up Trump - and Republicans squirm Vice President-elect Mike Pence defended Mr. Trump's Assange posts at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday, effectively doubling down on the incoming administration's icy blasts toward United States intelligence. Mr. Trump ""expressed his very sincere and healthy American skepticism about intelligence conclusions,"" Mr. Pence said, with House Republican leaders by his side. Mr. Trump's remarks have again placed fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position. Asked on Wednesday morning about the Twitter post, Speaker Paul D. Ryan steered clear of criticizing the president-elect, saying he would not be commenting on ""every little tweet or Facebook post."" But he called Mr. Assange ""a sycophant for Russia,"" who ""leaks, steals data and compromises national security."" Mr. Ryan noted that Mr. Trump had not yet received his latest briefing on Russia. ""Hopefully, he'll get up to speed on what's been happening and what Russia has or has not done,"" he said. From 'The Apprentice' to the White House Ms. Manigault, the villain and diva from Mr. Trump's reality television show ""The Apprentice,"" was officially named assistant to the president and director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison, one of a slate of Wednesday appointments that went to ardent Trump loyalists. The appointments include Bill Stepien, a confidant of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and a figure in the ""Bridgegate"" scandal, who will be White House political director. Keith Schiller, who was head of private security at Mr. Trump's real estate company, will be director of Oval Office operations. John DeStefano, a longtime aide to former House Speaker John A. Boehner, will direct presidential personnel. And George Gigicos, who organized those giant campaign rallies, will be director of advance, a further indicator that Mr. Trump plans to continue that sort of thing as president. But for star power, no one is going to beat Ms. Manigault. [Video: OMAROSA's OFFICIAL SIZZLE REEL Watch on YouTube.] Top White House jobs are going to political veterans Ms. Manigault aside, Mr. Trump is turning to some seasoned veterans to run key operations in his White House. Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday that he had selected Joe Hagin, who served for 14 years in the White House under Roanld Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, as his deputy chief of staff for operations, a key post in which he will be responsible for organizing presidential trips and security, among other things. He named Rick Dearborn, who has 25 years of experience on Capitol Hill, as his chief liaison to Congress, heading the Office of Legislative Affairs as well as the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Cabinet Affairs. Katie Walsh, who was chief of staff at the Republican National Committee under Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump's incoming chief of staff, will become his deputy at the White House, overseeing senior staff, scheduling and the Office of Public Liaison. In a statement, Mr. Priebus called the three a ""team of doers"" who would fill critical roles. Kellyanne Conway, who served as counselor to Mr. Trump, said she was thrilled to have ""another strong female leader"" on the team in Ms. Walsh. Trump finds timing of intelligence briefing 'very strange' First, Mr. Trump said that the nation should move beyond talk of Russian interference in the presidential election, but that he would listen to what American intelligence experts had to say. Then, on New Year's Eve, the president-elect promised that by Tuesday or Wednesday, he would reveal information on the hacking that Americans do not know. And now, he seems to think the intelligence community has not quite gotten its story straight. The Obama administration quickly let it be known that, in fact, intelligence leaders always intended to brief Mr. Trump on Friday in New York. And intelligence officials were not amused. Nor were some Republican political consultants. But this is not the first time the president-elect has taken a swipe at the intelligence community, which has concluded that Russia tried to help get him elected president. As debate begins on repealing health act, Trump steels G.O.P. spines President Obama is on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to plot a strategy to save his signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act. Vice President-elect Mike Pence countered with his own visit to congressional Republicans. ""The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare,"" Mr. Pence said. ""It needs to be done."" And Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter, trying to stiffen Republican spines as Democrats press their point that a fast gutting of the law will endanger the health care of 20 million people covered under the law and put at risk tens of millions more with pre-existing health problems. ""Schumer clowns"" may not be an olive branch to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new minority leader, but it is a signal that the incoming president is ready for war over health care. ""Republicans should stop clowning around with Americans' Medicare, Medicaid and health care,"" Mr. Schumer responded after meeting with the president. He warned that Republicans would ""throw the entire health care system into chaos."" Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, tried to coin a phrase: ""Make America sick again? Is that what Republicans want?"" Trump picks an S.E.C. chairman The Trump transition office named the lawyer Jay Clayton to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The president-elect is expected to speak to the news media on Jan. 11 The last time Mr. Trump held a real news conference was on July 27, when he said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had called him a genius and wrongly insisted that ""many people"" saw bombs strewn all over the floor of the San Bernardino, Calif., attackers' home and failed to report it. That long stretch without a real news media grilling did not do him much harm. He did, after all, win the election. But he says he will hold a true, open news conference next Wednesday. No word yet whether this session will take the place of the one he scheduled for last month, then canceled, to specifically reveal his plans for the future of his corporation.

Intelligence Chief Criticizes 'Disparagement' of Findings on Russian Hacking; Live Briefing,"WASHINGTON - The nation's top intelligence official, in a comment aimed at President-elect Donald J. Trump, said on Thursday that there was a difference between expressing ""skepticism"" of intelligence reports that Russia interfered with the American election and ""disparagement"" of the intelligence community. The official, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, was testifying at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, where Republicans and Democrats defended Mr. Clapper and others just as Mr. Trump has questioned foreign involvement. Other highlights from the hearing:  "" Intelligence officials said Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, should not be given credibility. "" Senator Lindsey Graham accused President Obama of throwing a ""pebble"" at the Russians. He said he would use a ""rock."" "" The Russian practice of planting ""fake news"" was an election-year propaganda tactic that remains in use, Mr. Clapper said. Difference between 'healthy skepticism' and 'disparagement' Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, was the first to take direct aim at Mr. Trump, wondering aloud ""who benefits from a president-elect trashing the intelligence community."" Mr. Clapper said pointedly that there was ""a difference between healthy skepticism"" - a phrase Vice President-elect Mike Pence used in defending Mr. Trump's criticism of the intelligence agencies - and ""disparagement."" ""The intelligence community is not perfect,"" Mr. Clapper added. ""We are an organization of human beings and we're prone sometimes to make errors."" But he referred to the wall of stars in the C.I.A. lobby commemorating the deaths of agency officers on duty and said the agencies' efforts to keep the country safe were not always appreciated. Ms. McCaskill said there would be ""howls from the Republican side of the aisle"" if a Democrat had spoken about intelligence officials as Mr. Trump has. ""Thank you for that nonpartisan comment,"" joked Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the committee. Intelligence officials say Assange deserves no credibility Mr. McCain steered the conversation to Mr. Assange, saying, ""I believe he is the one who's responsible for publishing the names of individuals who work for us who put us in direct danger."" ""Do you think there's any credibility we should attach to this individual?"" Mr. McCain asked. ""Not in my view,"" Mr. Clapper replied. Mr. McCain turned to Adm. Michael S. Rogers, a leader of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command. ""I would second those comments,"" Admiral Rogers said. Asked by Mr. McCain whether hacking the American elections would be an attack on the United States, Mr. Clapper demurred. ""Whether that constitutes an act of war is a very heavy call that I don't think the intelligence community should make,"" he said. But he called it a matter of ""great gravity."" Mr. McCain was sharply critical of what he described as the Obama administration's failure to devise a clear-cut policy of deterrence and retaliation for cyberattacks, saying that at times the United States government appeared to be a ""bystander."" Pebbles or rocks? Mr. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, asked Mr. Clapper if the intelligence community was prepared for ""being challenged"" by the president-elect at a briefing on Friday. ""Are you ready for the task?"" Mr. Graham asked. ""I think so,"" Mr. Clapper said dryly, adding that he and his colleagues were glad to be challenged and ready to explain their views. Mr. Graham said the Obama administration had lobbed mere ""pebbles"" at Russia in retaliation for the interference. ""When it comes to interfering with our election, we better be ready to throw rocks,"" he said. Mr. Graham also made clear that Republicans could well become the target of cyberattacks next time. ""Could it be Republicans next election?"" he said. ""It's not like we're so much better at cybersecurity than Democrats."" What about 'fake news'? Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat, asked if the dissemination of ""fake news"" was part of the Russian effort to influence the election. Mr. Clapper said it was, calling the attack ""a multifaceted campaign."" ""The hacking was only one part of it,"" Mr. Clapper said. ""And it also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news."" ""Does that continue?"" Mr. Reed asked. Mr. Clapper said yes. Senator offers a defense of Trump Perhaps the closest to a defense of Mr. Trump came from Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas. Noting ""imprecise language"" stating that Russia ""hacked the election,"" Mr. Cotton referred to Mr. Clapper's Oct. 7 statement on the matter and pressed him to be more specific about the agencies' findings. Mr. Cotton also suggested that the conventional wisdom that Mr. Putin favored Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton might be wrong. Mr. Trump promised a stronger military and more American oil and gas production - policies Mr. Cotton suggested would not be to Russia's advantage. Public must wait for new information on hackings Mr. Clapper suggested that he would not be unveiling major new inside information on the intelligence agencies' conclusion that the Russian government had directed the interference in the election. Mr. Clapper said he knew there was ""great interest"" in Russian interference in the election, but he indicated that public curiosity might have to wait for the release of an unclassified report on the matter early next week. President Obama is being briefed today on the full, classified report, and Mr. Trump will get an identical briefing on Friday. While keeping any scoops about the Russian attack for next week's release, Mr. Clapper did promise to ""push the envelope"" in declassifying as much detail as possible, including the motive of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in carrying it out. ""We'll be as forthcoming as we can, but there are some fragile and sensitive sources and methods here,"" he said. Mr. Clapper offered no new details but said that ""our assessment now is even more resolute"" that the Russians carried out the attack on the election. He confirmed that there was no Russian hacking that altered the actual vote count and repeated that it was not the agencies' job to assess the political impact of information released by Russian agents. What comes next? Though senators from both parties, led by Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on the Republican side, have called for a select committee to investigate Russian interference in the election, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has said a select committee was unnecessary. The Senate Intelligence Committee is ""more than capable of conducting a complete review,"" Mr. McConnell said last month, adding that Mr. McCain could also conduct an investigation on the Armed Services Committee.

"Trump, Fort Lauderdale, Golden Globes: Your Weekend Briefing","Here are the week's top stories, and a look ahead. 1. A U.S. intelligence report on Russian hackingahead of the American presidential election describes a sophisticated cyberattack scheme ordered by Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin. (Read the full declassified report.) It was released Friday, shortly after intelligence officials met in New York with President-elect Donald J. Trump, who then appeared to concede some Russian involvement - after months of casting doubt on it.  But he maintained that ""there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election"" and called for a closer relationship with Russia. Russian politicians and commentators ridiculed the findings. _____ 2. The gunman accused of killing five people and wounding six at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Friday was a former National Guardsman who was mentally disturbed, law enforcement officials said. They said Esteban Santiago, 26, heard voices in his head telling him to commit acts of violence, and they warned that learning his motive for the attack would be a long, complex process. Above, a victim of the shooting. _____ 3. President Obama will give a farewell address from his hometown, Chicago, on Tuesday (9 p.m. Eastern; stream it live). Earlier that day, Mr. Trump's pick for attorney general, SenatorJeff Sessions of Alabama, will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of his confirmation hearings. Similar hearings will be held for other cabinet picks throughout the week (here's a schedule), though many of them have yet to completebackground checks and ethics clearances - a situation the head of the Office of Government Ethics said had no precedent. _____ 4. Some of America's gravest racial fissures were in the spotlight last week. In South Carolina, a racist manifesto written by Dylann Roof, above, after he gunned down black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., in 2015 was read aloud as jurors considered whether to sentence him to death. A decision may be reached early this week. And in Chicago, four African-Americans were charged with hate crimes in the beating of a white teenager with mental disabilities. Video of the attack was broadcast on Facebook. _____ 5. Macy's and the long-struggling Sears Holdings announced numerous store closings, and new figures showed the U.S. job market closed 2016 on a tepid note. Still, Mr. Trump will inherit an economy that is fundamentally solid. One economist said he expected wages to rise by 3.5 percent in 2017, which would be the biggest gain for pay in nearly a decade. _____ 6. Some big names are on the move. Megyn Kelly, above, the No. 2-rated personality in cable television news, is leaving Fox News for NBC, where she'll have a daytime talk show and a Sunday news show. And Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general under Mr. Obama, is headed to California - at least for work. He was hired to represent the state in any legal fights against the new Republican White House. _____ 7. Ivanka Trump and her family are also migrating - to Washington. But as her husband, Jared Kushner, prepares for a White House role, his undisclosed talks with a secretive Chinese company highlight potential conflicts of interest. _____ 8. McAdozy. McAdork. Ben McAdoo, above, the head coach of the New York Giants, has become something of a cult figure on social media, often for reasons that have more to do with his bushy mustache than with football. His team plays the Green Bay Packers in a wild-card game on Sunday (4:40 p.m. Eastern, Fox) during the first weekend of the N.F.L. playoffs. On Saturday, the Houston Texans knocked out the Oakland Raiders and the Seattle Seahawks shut down the Detroit Lions. And in college football, the Clemson Tigers enter Monday's national championship game against Alabama looking to avenge last year's title-game loss to the Crimson Tide. _____ 9. Movie awards season kicks into high gear on Sunday with the Golden Globes (8 p.m. Eastern, NBC). We'll be covering it live. Oscar voting is also underway and will wrap up on Friday. Our podcast discusses four films you should know about: ""Fences,"" above, ""Passengers,"" ""La La Land"" and ""Patriots Day."" _____ 10. One of our best-read stories all week was about Dr. B.J. Miller, above, a triple amputee who is on a quest to change the way we die. His small, pioneering hospice is trying to reclaim the end of life as a human experience instead of primarily a medical one. The goal, as Dr. Miller likes to put it, is to ""de-pathologize death."" _____ 11. Finally, we asked our photo editor to pick his favorite image from this year's 52 Places to Go. He chose Botswana, above, which was fifth on the list. ""Apart from the famed wildlife, I highly recommend spending time getting to know Tswana traditional culture,"" said Daniella Rose Montemarano, a reader who commented on our Facebook post, saying she once lived there.

Trump Reacts to Russian Hacking; His Voters Shrug It Off; Letters,"To the Editor: Re ""Putin Led Scheme to Aid Trump, Report Says"" (front page, Jan. 7): President-elect Donald Trump's willful spurning of the nation's intelligence services, his continued praise for Vladimir Putin and his desperate speculation about alternative sources of the hacking that benefited his campaign should, taken together, give reasonable Americans pause. While we can be relieved that bipartisan leaders in Congress want to get to the bottom of this matter, will they be brave enough to subpoena the financial records and tax returns that Mr. Trump has refused to release?  Would these records show that Mr. Trump is, literally, indebted to the Russian oligarchy? Such findings would provide plausible motivation for both Russian actions and the president-elect's tweeted musings. I, for one, would like this nagging suspicion put to rest. STEPHEN SMITH Brooklyn To the Editor: So after deigning to receive information from sources other than whatever it is that simmers behind his own fevered brow, Donald Trump concedes that yes, there was some Russian hacking. Good of him. What will his story on this issue be tomorrow, or 10 minutes from now? He can't seem to hold onto an opinion for more than a few minutes at a time. MARTIN HYKIN Victoria, British Columbia To the Editor: Good for Donald Trump! What's wrong with reconciliation with Russia? Isn't this the proper Christian approach? Do we really want to keep Russia as our perpetual enemy? How long should we be dominated by the warmongers and the military-industrial complex? I disagree with almost everything Mr. Trump stands for. But he's got it right on this issue. MICHAEL RUSTIGAN Laguna Beach, Calif. To the Editor: Has anyone followed up on President-elect Donald Trump's statement on New Year's Eve that ""on Tuesday or Wednesday"" of last week he would surprise us with his revelations on hacking? I am waiting with bated breath (not). Or is this one more example of the showman keeping his name in the news? We have to get with the program - facts don't matter, publicity does! ELIZABETH BRANCH New Canaan, Conn. To the Editor: Re "" 'What's the Big Deal?' if Putin Meddled, Trump Voters Ask"" (front page, Jan. 8): Hacking, no big deal. Misogyny, no big deal. Racism, no big deal. Ignorance, no big deal. Pollution, no big deal. Opportunism, nepotism and corruption, no big deal. Regulations, just useless. Are these really the reactions of thoughtful citizens? If hacking is no big deal, everyone gets hacked and we should just get used to it - then why care about Hillary Clinton's private server? If nepotism and corruption in one's foundation and business are just the way of the world, then why was the Clinton Foundation suspected of possible wrongdoing? Do we really understand what has been going on here? These swings from nihilism to critical pseudo-thinking are just mind-boggling. To quote our Nobel laureate Bob Dylan: ""Something is happening here but you don't know what it is. Do you, Mr. Jones?"" STEVE DAVIDSON Georgetown, Tex. To the Editor: Trump voters playing down the Russian hacking would be apoplectic had Vladimir Putin intervened to help Hillary Clinton. They'd likely be calling for military reprisal. However, with their unruffled response to Mr. Putin's aiding Donald Trump, it's clear that they prize partisanship over patriotism. Not a pretty sight.   BRUCE TORFF Locust Valley, N.Y.  "
Senate Votes to Overturn Web Privacy,"WASHINGTON -- Republican senators moved Thursday to dismantle landmark internet privacy protections for consumers in the first decisive strike against telecommunications and technology regulations created during the Obama administration, and a harbinger of further deregulation. The measure passed in a 50-to-48 vote largely along party lines. The House is expected to mirror the Senate's action next week, followed by a signature from President Trump.    The move means Verizon, Comcast or AT&T can continue tracking and sharing people's browsing and app activity without permission, and it alarmed consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers. They warned that broadband providers have the widest look into Americans' online habits, and that without the rules, the companies would have more power to collect data on people and sell sensitive information.    ''These were the strongest online privacy rules to date, and this vote is a huge step backwards in consumer protection writ large,'' said Dallas Harris, a policy fellow for the consumer group Public Knowledge. ''The rules asked that when things were sensitive, an internet service provider asked permission first before collecting. That's not a lot to ask.''   The privacy rules were created in October by the Federal Communications Commission, and the brisk action of Congressional Republicans, just two months into Mr. Trump's administration, foreshadowed a broader rollback of tech and telecom policies that have drawn the ire of conservative lawmakers and companies like AT&T, Verizon and Charter.   Republican lawmakers and the new chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, have said the privacy rules were onerous and unfairly strapped regulations on telecom carriers, but not on web companies such as Facebook and Google that also provide access to online content.   ''It is unnecessary, confusing and adds another innovation-stifling regulation,'' Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said this month when he introduced the resolution to overturn the rules using the Congressional Review Act procedure that lets Congress overrule new agency regulations.   The Senate's vote was a victory for giant telecommunications and cable companies. The F.C.C. chairman under the Obama administration, Tom Wheeler, had declared that broadband would be regulated more heavily, by categorizing the service in the same regulatory bucket as telephone services, which are viewed as utilities.   That move acknowledged the importance of the internet for communications, education, work and commerce and the need to protect online users, Mr. Wheeler had said.   Under the internet privacy rules that Mr. Wheeler passed, apart from broadband providers having to ask permission to track browsing and other online activities of a user, the companies were also required to use ''reasonable measures'' to secure consumer data against hackers. The privacy rules were scheduled to go into effect at the end of this year   Broadband providers had balked and ramped up lobbying against the rules. Comcast and other broadband providers created the lobbying group 21st Century Privacy Coalition, led by a former Federal Trade Commission chairman, Jon Leibowitz, to defeat the broadband privacy rules.   ''We appreciate today's Senate action to repeal unwarranted F.C.C. rules that deny consumers consistent privacy protection online and violate competitive neutrality,'' the cable industry lobby group, NCTA-The Internet & Television Association, said in a statement on Thursday.   With Republicans now in charge across the government, AT&T and Comcast are also poised to benefit from further deregulation. Since the presidential election, the companies have pushed the new Republican-led F.C.C., lawmakers and the White House to roll back net neutrality, the requirement that broadband providers give equal access to all content on the internet, saying the rules hamper their ability to invest in new networks and jobs.   The F.C.C. chairman, Mr. Pai, has also talked with Republican allies in Congress about privacy and broadband classification. Mr. Pai has already chipped away at more than a dozen regulations, including aspects of net neutrality and the program, known as Lifeline, that provides subsidies for broadband users in low-income households.   Consumer groups warned that internet users would suffer from the changes. The Federal Trade Commission, the consumer protection agency, is barred from overseeing broadband providers, so without the F.C.C. privacy rules, the federal government will be a weaker watchdog over internet privacy, supporters of the regulations said.   ''Senate Republicans just made it easier for Americans' sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared and sold to the highest bidder without their permission,'' said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.   Democrats had taken to the Senate floor on Wednesday and Thursday to warn that without the rules, broadband providers will now have free range to peer into their customers' lives. A company like AT&T or Sprint can tell the time people wake up by when they check the clock on their phone, or see where users go to lunch or whom they visit. By tracking a user's browsing of medical websites, a carrier can also determine if that person might have an illness.   The Senate's action also signaled a philosophical shift on tech regulation. Lawmakers and Mr. Pai have said regulations should be created only when there is proof of harmful activity. They also argue that the telecom industry competes with internet firms such as Facebook and Google for access to online content, so any rules should also include those companies. Republicans have said the F.T.C. should be the watchdog for all online privacy.   But Democratic regulators have said the key difference is that consumers do not have many choices for broadband access, which makes them vulnerable to data collection by internet service providers.   ''Subscribers have little or no competitive choice as to which provider to use,'' said Terrell McSweeny, a Democratic commissioner of the F.T.C. Yet broadband providers ''know our identities, and their position gives them the technical capacity to surveil users in ways that others cannot.''     "
Trump Completes Repeal of Internet Privacy Rules,"President Trump on Monday signed a congressional resolution to complete the overturning of internet privacy protections created by the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama administration. The change will allow broadband internet service suppliers, such as cable and telecommunications companies, to track and sell a customer's online information with greater ease.     The Republican opponents of the Obama-era rules, which would have gone into effect later this year, said they would have unfairly placed restrictions on broadband providers, like Verizon and Comcast, that were more stringent than those on internet companies, like Google and Facebook.   The rules, approved in October when a majority of the commissioners were Democrats, would have required broadband companies to receive permission before collecting data on a user's online activities.   Some technology policy experts said jettisoning the rules would allow broadband providers to collect customers' internet browsing histories and other personal data and sell them to advertisers with little government oversight or fear of enforcement. Self-regulation and market competition, they said, may not sufficiently protect consumers.   ''This is a repeal with no replacement,'' said Danny Weitzner, director of the M.I.T. Internet Policy Research Initiative, who was a technology policy official in the Obama administration.   Broadband companies, privacy experts said, occupy a different position than internet companies. Google and Facebook, they noted, are corporate giants with plenty of market clout. But they are not a fundamental pathway to the internet the way the broadband providers are. And, privacy experts said, there is little or no competition for broadband service in many markets.   ''You can live without Google or Facebook,'' said Dallas Harris, a legal and policy fellow at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer group. ''It's pretty difficult to walk away from internet service altogether.''   The privacy practices of internet companies are overseen by the Federal Trade Commission, while broadband providers fall under the F.C.C. Since the 1990s, the trade commission has policed the privacy practices of internet companies under its mandate to protect consumers from ''unfair and deceptive practices.''   The F.T.C. requires internet companies to have privacy policies that the agency finds acceptable, and it conducts investigations into violations. Privacy advocates have criticized the trade commission for giving the companies too much freedom.   ''It is lightweight regulation, but there is a real enforcement backstop as well,'' Mr. Weitzner said.   Broadband carriers all have privacy policies. They can be sued by private plaintiffs and investigated by Congress, as they were about a decade ago, when an intrusive surveillance technique of personal data trails, known as deep packet inspection, came to light.   Just how valuable data collection may be for broadband companies is uncertain. Online advertising can be a lucrative, high-profit business. That is why Verizon, for example, bought AOL and is in the process of acquiring Yahoo's internet assets.   Yet Google and Facebook account for two-thirds of online ad revenue, and their share of the market is growing. ''The challenge is that Google and Facebook dominate this market,'' said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen & Company.   The broadband suppliers have ''valuable, anonymized profiles of users,'' Mr. Gallant said, adding, ''But it's not clear what the size of the market for the raw data is.''

How to Protect Your Private Data From Prying Apps,"In the real world, your personal life is a private space. But in tech, your personal data is a ripe resource for businesses to harvest in their own interests. That was the broad takeaway from last week's New York Times profile on Uber, the car-summoning service, and its chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Among other revelations, the report illuminated that to stay competitive, Uber bought information about its main American ride-hailing competitor, Lyft, from Unroll.me, a free email digest service.    How did Unroll.me get data about Lyft? While people could use the service free of charge to unsubscribe from marketing emails, Unroll.me made money by scanning the contents of its users' inboxes and selling anonymized data, information that did not have individuals' names attached to it (in this case, emailed Lyft receipts), to other companies, including marketers. Many consumers found Unroll.me's practices misleading.   In addition, Uber was involved in some deception of its own: It participated in fingerprinting, a process in which iPhones were tagged with permanent identities that were detectable even after the Uber app was erased from the devices. The practice violated Apple's terms of service, which could have resulted in Uber's being banned from the App Store. Uber eventually revised the app to remove the fingerprinting code.    When it comes to data collection, services like Unroll.me and Uber are small fry compared with internet giants like Google and Facebook, which have a wealth of information about people. And then there are large data brokers like Acxiom, CoreLogic, Datalogix and ID Analytics, which collect, analyze and sell billions of details about consumers' online activities for marketing purposes.   For consumers, giving up some data has become part of the trade-off of receiving compelling, personalized services. But that doesn't mean you have to be caught by surprise. Here are some tips from privacy experts on protecting yourself from tricky data collection.   Read privacy policies   It was never a secret that Unroll.me was sharing anonymized user data with third parties. Its privacy policy, which was publicly posted, says that ''we may collect, use, transfer, sell and disclose non-personal information for any purpose'' and that data can be used ''to build anonymous market research products and services.''   That so many people were caught by surprise showed how rarely they bother to read terms of service agreements, including privacy policies, said Runa Sandvik, director of information security for The New York Times.   When you sign up for a new app or web tool, the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service. To avoid a privacy pitfall like the one involving Unroll.me, start perusing the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy. If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable, opt against using the service.   Of course, you would not be alone if you felt confused or uninformed after reading a terms of service agreement, which is saddled with language written by lawyers.   ''People quickly run into the challenge that there's so much legalese that it's up to you to envision how your data may be used,'' Ms. Sandvik said.   Still, it's better than reading nothing.   Research company business models   Rarely is a free product ever truly free, and a company's business model can provide insight into how your data may eventually be shared. If you are using a product that does not charge an upfront fee or show any advertising, a for-profit company has to find some way to monetize your patronage.   For many companies, the path to monetization is anonymized, aggregated user data. That means while your name will not be attached to the information, your age, gender, shopping activities and location will all be rolled up with other users' data. Altogether, that becomes incredibly valuable information to many retailers looking for market research.   The good news: There are some nonprofits with no ties to the advertising industry that offer tools to protect your privacy, said Lee Tien, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. For example, his nonprofit provides Privacy Badger, a free ad blocker, in hopes of getting people to become members and donate to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Free open-source tools like uBlock Origin, another ad blocker, and Signal, an encrypted messaging app, also lack skin in the advertising game.   But if it's a for-profit business offering a free product, count on it monetizing your data somehow.   ''Follow the money,'' Mr. Tien said. ''If you're not paying for it with money, you're paying for it with data.''   So before subscribing to a free app or online tool, take a moment to do a web search for the company's business model.   Audit your apps   It's worthwhile to periodically check your primary online accounts, like Facebook, Twitter or Google, to see which apps are hooked into them. Chances are you have used those accounts to quickly sign up for a web tool or app. The ones you never use may still be leeching off your personal data, so you should disable them.   On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to the account. On your Google account page, you can find a similar apps list labeled ''Connected apps & sites.'' And on Twitter, go to the Apps page under ''Settings and privacy.''   Ms. Sandvik recommended pruning apps that you don't recognize or have not used in the last six months. Once you have narrowed down the list, take a deeper dive on the ones that remain and read up on how they use your personal data. If their data-sharing practices sound offensive, remove the apps.   Do this audit at least once a year: The number of connected apps on your online accounts can pile up over time. On my neglected Facebook account, for example, I had 82 connected apps. After removing many unused or defunct apps, like LivingSocial, Words With Friends and Draw Something, I had 32 left.   Opt out for good   Deleting your app from your phone or computer often isn't enough. You'll remove data from the device itself, but not from the company's servers.   If you've lost trust in a company, make the cleanest break possible: Delete your account. In the case of an app like Uber, for example, you can submit a request on the company's website to have your account deleted. Similarly, with Unroll.me, you can log in to the site and click through the settings to delete your account.   Even after doing that, you will have to reconcile with the idea that the company will probably hold on to the information you have already shared.   ''Data you've provided to the service as part of using the service is data that they can store and continue to use,'' Ms. Sandvik said. ''It falls under the terms of service.''   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
Facebook Challenged On Privacy In Europe,"Facebook suffered a setback on Tuesday over how it uses the reams of information it collects about users worldwide, after two European privacy watchdogs said that the social network's practices broke their countries' data protection rules.  The announcement by Dutch and French authorities was part of a growing pushback across the European Union about how Facebook collects data on the bloc's roughly 500 million residents. Some European governments, notably in Germany, are considering hefty fines against the company and other social media giants if they fail to crack down on hate speech and misinformation on their networks.    As part of their separate announcements on Tuesday, the Dutch and French officials said that Facebook had not provided people in their countries with sufficient control over how their details are used. They said that the social network had collected digital information on Facebook users as well as nonusers on third-party websites without their knowledge.   The French regulator, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés, or CNIL, said that it had fined Facebook 150,000 euros, or about $164,000, for failing to meet France's data protection rules. The CNIL chairwoman, Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, also leads a Pan-European group of privacy officials. The fine represents a relatively small amount for Facebook, which generates tens of billions of dollars a year in online advertising. The Dutch authority, which could still reach a settlement with Facebook, did not impose a financial penalty.   ''Facebook proceeded to a massive compilation of personal data of internet users in order to display targeted advertising,'' the French watchdog said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. ''It has also been noticed that Facebook collected data on browsing activity of internet users on third-party websites without their knowledge.''   Despite the financial penalty, the agency has not ordered Facebook to alter how it handles data on people in France who use the service.   Facebook said that it was complying with European data protection rules, which are among the most stringent in the world. The company added that it had simplified its online privacy tools in recent years to give people more control over how their data was used.   ''Facebook has long complied with E.U. data protection law through our establishment in Ireland,'' Lena Pietsch, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement, referring to the company's international headquarters in Dublin. ''We remain open to continuing to discuss these issues with the CNIL.''   Facebook, which said it had not decided whether to appeal the most recent data protection rulings, has battled Europe's privacy laws before. Last year, the company won on appeal a case, brought by the authorities in Belgium, alleging that the social network had been collecting too much data on users in the country.   Separately, data protection agencies in Germany and in Spain continue to investigate Facebook's activities.     "
Checking a Website's Security,"Q. I was browsing online and noticed a small letter ''i'' in a circle. What does that mean? I use the Chrome browser. A. The web is full of sites that do not use the strongest security, and some browsers -- including Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox -- now warn users when the page they are visiting may put their information at risk. In Chrome, that ''i'' symbol indicates a site may not be secure because it is using an unencrypted connection to exchange data with your computer. When you click the ''i'' on the left side of the Chrome address bar, you can see more information about the site, adjust some settings and possibly see a ''Your connection to this site is not secure'' warning.     As you may have noticed from online shopping, sites with secure connections use the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure technology to encrypt data between their web servers and your computer; this helps protect your credit-card number and other personal information from being intercepted by someone else. These sites also have a security certificate from a trusted authority that verifies the website's identity, so you know you are not on a spoofed site. You should see a padlock icon and a URL that starts with https:// when you have a secure connection.   Chrome labels sites that use a plain HyperText Transfer Protocol connection (http://) without the encryption factor as ''nonsecure,'' because a third party could intercept your information -- or the site could be masquerading as something else; try adding an ''s'' to the end of the http:// prefix to see if the site has a secure version. Sites that Google considers dangerous because of major security lapses or possible malicious intent get a red alert triangle in the address box, and sometimes a full-page warning.   Google announced in September that it was ''moving towards a more secure web'', and Mozilla recently added insecure-password warnings to the Firefox browser. Many sites around the web (including NYTimes.com and other news organizations) have also switched to https:// connections to improve user privacy and security.

Keeping Data Secure When Your Laptop Is in the Shop,"Q. I need to take my laptop to get its dead battery replaced, but I'm worried about other people being able to see my files. How can I make sure no one working on the computer can get into my personal information?  A. Your computer repair shop probably has a checklist of things to do before you drop off the laptop, but start by doing a full backup of your system so you have a copy of all your files in case something inadvertently happens when the machine is open on the work table. Fixes like battery or keyboard replacement, memory upgrades and jack repair should not affect the data on the hard drive, but making a complete backup should provide peace of mind in case of complications.    As for the security of the data on the drive, you can lock up personal folders that you would like to keep private with encryption software -- or encrypt the whole hard drive if you do not think the technicians will need to log into the computer. Windows 10 Professional includes a utility called BitLocker, and macOS has a disk-encryption tool called FileVault you can use to lock up the contents of your disk behind a password; third-party encryption software like VeraCrypt is available for systems without built-in security features.   If you think a technician will need to start up your computer to verify the results or assist with the repair, you may want to take other privacy precautions, like deleting browser history and stored passwords, and any files that contain financial or identity information. Unless the technician needs to use an administrator account, creating a guest or limited user account can also keep the intrusions to a minimum. If an administrator account is needed, disabling the password or changing it temporarily lets you avoid sharing the real one.

Skipping the Line With the Touch of a Finger,"Airport terminals are often a maze of lines that choke check-in counters and kiosks, baggage drop-off areas, gates and security checkpoints. Finding solutions to line fatigue has become a priority for the Transportation Security Administration -- and a business opportunity for others. A company called Clear is using fingerprints and iris scans to spare some passengers the first phase of the T.S.A.'s security airport screening process -- the document-verification checkpoint and its line.    Clear says it can speed fliers through checkpoints while maintaining tight security. But the rollout process has been slow -- Clear is available only in some terminals at 24 domestic airports -- an earlier iteration of the company had a data security issue.    The core of Clear's business is biometric security, using scans of body parts to verify identity. To enroll, people submit to fingerprint and iris scans at the company's airport kiosks. The data is captured and stored electronically. Before each flight, Clear customers are prescreened by the T.S.A., like other travelers. But at an airport where Clear is operating, instead of handing passports or driver's licenses to T.S.A. agents, Clear members may re-scan their fingers or eyes at the company's kiosks. They then walk through a dedicated lane that leads directly to T.S.A. body and carry-on bag scanners, where they undergo physical screening. There they might encounter a line, typically a shorter one.   The T.S.A. ''oversees and actively tests Clear's technology,'' Lisa Farbstein, a T.S.A. spokeswoman, said in an email. The company's technology is certified by the Department of Homeland Security as part of the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act.   The biometrics used by Clear are an improvement over the traditional method of identity verification because they lessen ''the human error factor,'' said John Pistole, former chief of the T.S.A. ''People make mistakes from time to time,'' he said. (Mr. Pistole is now a member of the Director of National Intelligence Senior Advisory Group, president of Anderson University in Indiana and a paid adviser to American Airlines and to an airport-security start-up called Evolv Technology.)   Since Apple installed fingerprint readers on the iPhone in 2013, biometric screening has become commonplace. It is used by credit card companies and in consumer products like gun safes.   But in 2003, when Clear was founded, biometric technology was rarefied, known to the public mostly through science fiction films. The company, originally called Verified Identity Pass, filed for bankruptcy in 2009, a year after it temporarily lost a laptop with enrollees' unencrypted personal information. Verified Identity Pass claimed there had been no security breach, but the T.S.A. required it to encrypt all sensitive personal data and submit to an independent audit before it could resume customer enrollments.   The newfangled nature of the technology was part of the company's problem, along with a heavy debt load and high operating expenses, said Caryn Seidman Becker, who bought the business in 2010 with Ken Cornick. They had earlier started a hedge fund that closed in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis.   They changed the company's name to Clear and restarted the business, taking steps to cut costs and improve efficiency. Verified Identity Pass had been licensing software and issuing ID cards loaded with biometric data. They developed their own software and eliminated the cards, which helped to shorten the identity verification process at airports to 1.5 seconds from five seconds, they said.   The company is making money, Ms. Seidman Becker and Mr. Cornick said, but they wouldn't disclose how much. Last year, Delta bought 5 percent of Clear. Earlier this year, T. Rowe Price invested $15 million.   Clear operates in 24 airports and seven sports arenas and stadiums, including Citi Field and Yankee Stadium. The partners say Clear has more than one million subscribers, up from the 190,000 they inherited.   In May, Delta began using Clear's biometric technology for boarding passes at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Fingerprint scans also give Clear members who are Delta passengers entry to airline lounges and are expected to soon allow them to check bags and forgo paper boarding passes at security checkpoints. Delta SkyMiles passengers receive discounts on Clear memberships.   Undiscounted memberships cost $179 per year. Other less-pricey programs also give travelers expedited passage through airport security and are more widely available. For instance, T.S.A. PreCheck costs $85 for five years and is available at 200 airports, and JetBlue passengers can pay $10 per flight to use a faster lane at more than 60 airports.   Still, frequent travelers might appreciate the time savings offered by Clear, which ushers its customers ahead of the T.S.A.'s standard document verification checkpoint as well as the T.S.A. PreCheck checkpoint. Spouses of Clear members can join for $50 and there's no charge for children under 18 who fly with a subscriber.   Ms. Seidman Becker and Mr. Cornick hope to extend Clear's reach further. They say the company's technology could be used to make purchases in stores, ride elevators programmed to stop at a subscriber's usual floor, get pharmaceutical prescriptions filled and verify a person's age at bars.   But such notions give pause to internet security experts. ''If you're taking this from airports to bars and retail, how are you locking down your systems to not open them up to attacks?'' asks Alvaro Bedoya, executive director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law School. ''Folks who run airport security tend to run tighter security than folks who ID people at bars.''   One effective way of safeguarding privacy is to convert the raw fingerprints and iris scans into impenetrable ID codes, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit internet privacy group. Companies should verify each person's identity against the stored code, or ''hash,'' rather than the actual fingerprint or iris scan, he said, and the data should be double-encrypted.   Ms. Seidman Becker said Clear used ''multiple systems of proprietary technology'' to protect against security breaches. She declined to describe the systems other than to say they involve double encryption. ''We spend a tremendous amount of time and capital on keeping customers' data private and secure,'' she said.   If a breach involving raw biometric data were to occur, the consequences would be profound, Mr. Hall said: ''Once the raw data is out there, it's very hard to put the genie back in the bottle.''

How You Can Browse Safely After Repeal of Privacy Rules,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Congress on Tuesday moved to dismantle online privacy rules created during the Obama era. The rules, which were scheduled to take effect this year, would have required internet providers to get permission before collecting and selling a customer's online information, including browsing activities. What does this mean for your privacy and what can you do? Here's what to know.     What online privacy rules did Congress overturn?   Congress voted to overturn rules created by the Federal Communications Commission in October that required broadband providers to get your permission before collecting private data on your online activities and offering it for sale to advertisers.   How does that affect my online privacy?   The truth is, you never had much online privacy.   The new F.C.C. rules had not taken effect, so you probably won't notice any difference. Internet service providers have always been able to monitor network traffic, see what websites you visit and share some of that information with advertisers.   So is this a big deal?   Yes.   The new F.C.C. rules would have given consumers stronger privacy protections -- without such restrictions, internet providers may decide to become more aggressive with data collection and retention. Expect more targeted advertising to come your way.   How do broadband providers collect data on me in the first place?   These companies provide your connection to the internet. Your gadgets are each assigned an identifier, called an IP address, and an internet provider can see which IP addresses are being used on your account.   When you are browsing the web, the service provider helps route your device's internet traffic to each destination website. In other words, internet providers can see which devices you use and which websites you visit and choose to retain that data.   What can I do to safeguard my online data?   Many privacy advocates say this a good time to consider investing in a virtual private network, or VPN. A VPN is a tunnel that shields your browsing information from your internet service provider and allows you to appear as if you are in a different location.   However, a VPN isn't a foolproof solution. A VPN service is also tied to a service provider, meaning a VPN provider could also share your information with the service provider if it wanted to, said Runa Sandvik, a director of information security for The New York Times.   In other words, you will have to pick a VPN provider that has a strong privacy policy and take a leap of faith.   Which VPN should I get?    Ms. Sandvik recommended Freedome by F-Secure and said TunnelBear was another popular option.   The Wirecutter, the product recommendations site owned by The New York Times, highlighted a service called Private Internet Access.   What else can help?   People who are concerned about their privacy might also consider using Tor, a type of software that helps internet users mask their online identities and whereabouts, Ms. Sandvik said.   Tor essentially encrypts your browsing activity and bounces a website request to multiple servers, decrypting layers of information about the request with every server ''hop,'' which makes it difficult to see from where and whom the original request came.   What are the downsides of VPN and Tor?   Some services might break: for example, Netflix blocks VPN users from accessing its content. And Tor often makes web browsing sluggish.   Ms. Sandvik recommended using a combination of the two whenever it feels necessary -- like when you are accessing sensitive information related to your work, for instance.   Follow Brian X.

Is It Time to Consider an Identity Protection Service?,"The disturbing news about the Equifax breach had barely sunk in when the ominous marketing messages began to take hold. There was a fortuitously timed television commercial from Experian, another one of the big three credit bureaus, which asked: ''Is your personal information already being traded on the dark web?''    The website for LifeLock, an identity theft protection service, featured this headline: ''Data breached? Get LifeLock.'' It mentioned that a ''big credit reporting bureau'' had recently been attacked, though it conveniently failed to mention Equifax by name -- possibly because LifeLock uses Equifax to perform some of the services it is advertising.   Then there was MyIDCare, another protection service, shaming LifeLock for its relationship with Equifax. ''LifeLock uses Equifax,'' MyIDCare said on its website. ''We don't.''    In the aftermath of the breach, many Americans -- half of whom may have had sensitive details exposed in the attack -- are trying to make sense of the offers flowing in from identity theft services.   But these services vary greatly, both in reputation and in offerings, according to fraud and privacy experts. Signing up also requires consumers to entrust yet another corporate entity with their most sensitive data -- many of the same details stolen in the Equifax breach -- while entering into legal agreements filled with fine print that leads consumers to give up many rights.   Some of the more prominent services also have questionable histories. The Government Accountability Office counts at least 16 federal enforcement actions taken against providers of identity theft protection -- financial institutions among them -- for various infractions, according to a March  report.   LifeLock, for instance, paid $100 million in 2015 to settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that it failed to secure its users' most sensitive data and used deceptive advertising (for the second time). This year, Equifax and TransUnion agreed to pay a combined $23 million to settle a regulator's allegations that they tricked consumers into paying for credit scores of questionable value.   ''I personally think it's a waste of money,'' said Avivah Litan, a security analyst at the technology research firm Gartner. She was referring to services that say they scan the dark web, the hard-to-find regions of the internet where, among other things, criminals trade stolen information.   ''I just assume my data is being sold on the dark web,'' Ms. Litan said. ''You should just assume it is stolen,'' she added, and act accordingly.   An estimated 17.6 million people, or about 7 percent of United States residents 16 or older, were victims of identity theft in 2014, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report, the latest available. In the vast majority of cases, an unauthorized person tried to gain access to an existing account, such as a bank or credit card account.   There are several ways for consumers to protect themselves without buying anything at all, though some experts believe that some independent services can be helpful in certain circumstances.   So what exactly do they do?   Most identity protection services include some sort of credit monitoring, generally hiring one or more of the big bureaus to track your files for any recent changes. So if there is suspicious activity -- new credit accounts, a big increase in what you owe, a delinquency -- you'll learn about it after the fact.   But identity protection companies promise to go well beyond credit monitoring, with scans of the dark web, public databases, court records, social media and other obscure places. They're looking for a variety of items, which might include Social Security numbers, addresses, emails, phone numbers (former ones, too), dates of birth, medical identification numbers and other personal identifying information. They might find it for sale by criminals -- or already in use.   Despite all the scanning and monitoring that these services claim to do, they aren't necessarily going to prevent a crime. In some ways, learning that your stolen data is on the dark web is like finding your empty wallet after thieves made off with your cash. You can't get your Social Security number back. But a red flag may be raised after something suspicious happens.   ''The answer is not a silver bullet,'' said Johan Roets, chief executive of Intersections, the parent company of Identity Guard, an identity protection service. ''My product is trying to coach people along the way.'' It has three alerts -- low, medium and critical -- that tell consumers why something matters and what to do about it.   Some providers monitor the United States Postal Service's change-of-address database, according to the Government Accountability Office report, so consumers can correct changes made by someone trying to improperly redirect their mail.   But consumers need to be able to trust that the companies will protect the information they are scanning for. Identity Guard asks consumers to provide 26 pieces of personal data, though Mr. Roets says that data remains on its operational servers and never touches the internet.   Identity protection services can be particularly helpful after a theft, experts said. ''They will take serious ongoing cases of ID theft, especially cross-state, and will help clear it up and shut it down,'' said Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit research group.   IDShield works in this area, in addition to providing identity monitoring. ''If something bad happens, we do all the work to restore the identity,'' said Jeff Bell, the chief executive officer of LegalShield, IDShield's parent company. ''We don't catch them in the act, but now we are immediately talking to whoever is making the loan or selling the product and telling them there is a problem here.''   IDShield works with Kroll, which has licensed private investigators covering every state. The investigators get a limited power of attorney so they can work on the customer's behalf with banks, government agencies and other institutions, Mr. Bell explained. The investigators' tasks will vary depending on the complexity of the case, but they might also search for additional instances of identity theft and dispute the errors with companies and agencies, including the credit bureaus.   If a person with an existing problem wants to hire IDShield, he or she pays a one-time fee of $899, and then a monthly rate of either $9.95 or $19.95. Existing customers are covered by the monthly fee if a problem arises. But again, the risk never goes away entirely, so those monthly fees can add up.   A credit freeze, a topic that my colleague Ron Lieber has covered in depth, will prevent some fraud without the monthly fees: It allows consumers to turn off access to their credit files at each of the three bureaus, which blocks thieves from taking out a loan or opening other accounts in their name.   Even putting your files on ice, however, won't protect against several other types of fraud that experts like Ms. Litan, from Gartner, worry about even more. That includes the takeover of financial accounts and cellphones (which are used to gain access to bank and other accounts), and fraud related to tax refunds, Social Security payments and other government benefits.   When I took Experian's pitch and entered my work email address into its dark web scanner, lo and behold, it said my email had shown up in this mysterious netherworld three times last year.   Its recommendation? Strengthen my passwords and sign up for its dark web surveillance and identity theft protection services.     "
Preventing the Hacking of Our Elections,"To the Editor: Regarding the Russian attack on our electoral process, the next congressional election is only a year and a half away, and steps need to be taken now to protect our critical information.     The Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee need to separate their email and internet browsing functions from their databases, recognizing that the majority of data breaches come from malware included in email and compromised websites.   This can be done by hosting their email and internet browsing at a major cloud provider, which has better physical and logical access controls and software maintenance than any political organization can provide. The databases should be similarly hosted, but separate from email and internet browsing.   Each state's voting systems also need to be further protected. The Federal Election Commission should vet and approve a number of voting systems, and then support all 50 states in selecting a vetted system (that has a paper trail and the testing, maintenance controls and design integrity to support our national elections).   Voting machines at the local level should not be connected to the internet. Maintenance and testing can be done by off-line protocols and results communicated to the county level the way it was done 25 years ago: through secure fax or telephone protocols.   County servers also should not be on the internet. If they need to communicate with the state's central system, then inexpensive private circuits can be rented from the major telecom suppliers, without the risks of internet hacking.   Each state's central system would be isolated from all email or internet browsing functions, as for the D.N.C. and R.N.C. Such functions would be provided by hosted cloud providers.   These measures, along with enhanced physical and logical access controls at the local, county and state levels, will help improve the integrity of our country's voting results.   ARTHUR M. TELCHIN, NEW YORK   The writer is an I.T. risk management consultant.     "
Tech Roundup: The Latest in the Google-Uber Fracas,"The long-running rivalry between Uber and Google has taken many twists and turns. The two companies have been competing to hire talent and to race ahead of each other in technologies like driverless cars.  Now, the latest fracas between the technology behemoths is heading into uncertain legal waters.    It all began last month, when Google's sister company that focuses on self-driving cars, Waymo, sued Uber for using stolen intellectual property in its autonomous vehicles. Though the case could eventually end up going to trial, Uber made a push on Wednesday for parts of the lawsuit to be settled through arbitration, writes Daisuke Wakabayashi, a tech reporter for The New York Times.   Specifically, Uber revealed in a new court document that Waymo previously pursued arbitration with Anthony Levandowski, who formerly worked on Google's self-driving cars and is now the head of Uber's autonomous car unit. According to the filing, Waymo went the arbitration route with Mr. Levandowski last October over its contention that he tried to hire Google employees by using confidential salary information from the company. It's unclear what the outcome of the arbitration was.   Uber's implication with the new court filing? That the latest accusations, that Mr. Levandowski stole intellectual property from Google, can also be handled by arbitration. A court trial, where more details could spill out, is not the way forward, Uber suggests.   The ride-hailing company also wants the court to declare that Waymo's allegations that it stole trade secrets and competed unfairly are ''meritless.''

Service Faces a Backlash For Selling Personal Data,"For months, Uber has paid a public price for some of the questionable tactics it has used to conquer the transportation industry. Now another company is experiencing some of the fallout for working with Uber. Slice Intelligence, a data firm that uses an email management program called Unroll.me to scan people's inboxes for information, faced an outcry that began on Sunday after The New York Times reported that Uber had used Slice's data to keep tabs on its ride-hailing rival Lyft.    Unroll.me, a free service to unsubscribe from email lists, can scour people's inboxes for receipts from services like Lyft and then sell the information to companies like Uber. The data is anonymized, meaning individuals' names are not attached to the information, and can be used as a proxy for the health of a rival.    After the revelation, angry users demanded that Unroll.me explain why the company had gone into their inboxes and betrayed their trust. Late on Sunday, Jojo Hedaya, the chief executive of Unroll.me, apologized in response to the surprised reaction to a practice that he said the company had been open about in the past.   ''It was heartbreaking to see that some of our users were upset,'' Mr. Hedaya said in a blog post. ''Recent customer feedback tells me we weren't explicit enough.''   We can, and will, do better. A statement from our CEO: https://t.co/hra3e3ToVx -- Unroll.Me (@Unrollme) April 23, 2017   What Unroll.me does is far from an anomaly -- it is part of an expansive and largely unregulated world of selling personal data collected by online consumer services. As long as a service like Unroll.me has a privacy policy, adheres to it and does not sell personally identifiable information, like someone's name, it is fairly free to package and sell the data it collects.   Yet privacy advocates said the modern technology of data analytics allowed such fine-grained measurement of a person's online behavior that the concept of personally identifiable information was all but obsolete.   ''Many of the services or apps we use for 'free' are monetizing data about us,'' said Lee Tien, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization focused on digital rights.   Companies like Unroll.me have long acted as intelligence services offering insights to businesses seeking to gain a competitive edge. Both Uber and Lyft pay for information from Slice as well as other data services, according to two people familiar with the companies' competitive intelligence programs, who asked to remain anonymous because the programs were confidential. Uber and Lyft declined to comment.   Unroll.me, which was bought by Slice in 2014, is a tiny player in the personal data market. The larger data brokers -- with names like Acxiom, CoreLogic, Datalogix and ID Analytics -- have been the subject of inquiries by a congressional committee and the Federal Trade Commission.   In 2014, after concluding its investigation, the F.T.C. called on Congress to protect consumers against the unchecked collection and marketing of their digital data. The F.T.C. report detailed how some of the companies classify consumers in data-driven social and demographic groups for marketing purposes with labels like ''financially challenged,'' ''diabetes interest'' and ''smoker in the household.'' The concern is that such classifications could be used to limit fair access to financial services or health insurance.   The F.T.C. recommendation, which was endorsed in a separate report by the Obama administration, was not taken up in Congress.   Unroll.me bills itself as offering an easy way to ''clean up your inbox.'' After someone grants the service access to his or her email account, Unroll.me serves up a list of all the subscriptions they are a part of, with the option to quickly opt out of the ones they no longer want to receive. The company also organizes subscription emails and delivers a newsletter-style digest of some subscriptions.   The service, which began as a test in 2011, quickly took off with users, attracting the attention of Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce giant that now owns Slice. Rakuten invested in Unroll.me before Slice ultimately bought it.   Unroll.me discloses its freewheeling use of personal data in its privacy policy, which says that ''we may collect, use, transfer, sell and disclose nonpersonal information for any purpose'' and that the data can be used ''to build anonymous market research products and services.''   Yet few people read such policies closely, privacy advocates said. Katharina Kopp, director of policy at the Center for Digital Democracy, said of Unroll.me, ''Under the disguise of being customer friendly and helping their customers to get rid of 'email junk,' they allow the profiling and targeting of their unwitting customers by third parties.''   Ms. Kopp called the Unroll.me tactic a ''particularly misleading practice,'' despite the disclosure in its privacy policy.   In its blog post on Sunday, Unroll.me said it had underestimated how many people would be surprised at the methods it used to build its business. The company said it was working on making its business model more transparent to users, with clearer messaging on its website, on its app and in its frequently asked questions section.   In several posts on Twitter, Unroll.me pointed fingers at Google's Gmail and at Facebook as having more personal data on people. ''Just know, Gmail has more data on you than we ever would,'' Unroll.me posted.   @devevangelist @nickoneill @johnsheehan We were acquired over two years ago, and we totally understand how you feel. Just know, Gmail has more data on you than we ever would. -- Unroll.Me (@Unrollme) April 23, 2017   Some of those who were upset with the practices of Unroll.me chalked it up to a learning experience.   ''If it is on the internet and is free, then you are not the client or the user,'' wrote Craig, a commenter on the Unroll.me blog post. ''You are the product.''     "
Apple Plans Data Center in China,"SHANGHAI -- Apple said Wednesday that it would open its first data center in China, joining a parade of technology companies responding to growing global demands to build facilities that store online data closer to customers. The move is a response to a strict new law in China that requires companies to store users' data in the country. The new data center, in Guizhou, a province in southwest China, is part of a $1 billion investment in the province and will be operated in partnership with a local data management company, Apple said.    The move is part of a worldwide trend regarding the security and sovereignty of digital data. Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are among the big American technology companies plowing billions of dollars into building data centers in Germany, the Netherlands, France and other countries. While some of the expansion is for technical reasons -- the online services operate faster when they are near customers -- the companies are also reacting to growing pressure from European governments and customers to maintain some control over their data.    As is the case with many laws, the digital security regulations approved last month in China were vaguely worded, leaving many foreign companies uncertain about which parts would be enforced and how. Already, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM have formed partnerships with Chinese companies to offer cloud computing services based in China. Apple, easily the most successful foreign technology company in China, had much to lose without a plan for its own data center in the country.   Apple said in a statement Wednesday that the new center would keep ''strong data privacy and security protections in place.'' The company added that no back doors, meaning ways for the government or other organizations to get around Apple's encryption protecting the data, would be created in its systems.   ''The addition of this data center will allow us to improve the speed and reliability of our products and services while also complying with newly passed regulations,'' Apple said.   China's rules also call for security reviews and for users of messaging apps to register their real identities. The regulations are part of a Chinese industrial policy adopted to build local capabilities. For example, a government plan called Made in China 2025 names several industries, including robotics and electric cars, in which China hopes its companies will become leaders. Foreign business groups have said the laws unfairly discriminate against companies that are not Chinese.   The iPhone is a symbol of middle-class ambitions in China and is the foundation of Apple's business in the country, which accounts for 21 percent of the company's global sales, making it Apple's most important market after the United States.   But the iPhone has also become emblematic of China's long reliance on foreign technology. Even before China passed the cybersecurity law last year requiring that the online data of its citizen be stored domestically, the country was pressuring foreign technology companies to operate its computer servers within its borders.   Apple already stores some of the data of China's residents in local servers, but the new agreement goes one step further with a Chinese partner responsible for running its data center, managing the sales of its services in the country and handling legal requests for data from the government.   In 2014, Apple first moved some of the data of its Chinese customers that had been overseas to a domestic plant operated by China Telecom. The change occurred shortly after state-run China Central Television raised security concerns that Apple was tracking the locations of iPhone users.   Careful not to offend, Apple said it ''appreciated'' that CCTV had flagged the issue but explained that the company did not have access to its users' locations.   The opening date for the new data center has not been set, but when it does open, Apple's iCloud will operate from an Apple plant run by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry, a data management company. That means that if Apple customers in mainland China want to buy additional iCloud storage in the future, they will do so through Apple's Chinese partner.   Apple said, however, that it would retain the encryption keys for the data stored at its center and that Guizhou-Cloud Big Data would not have access, meaning it would not be able to see what photos or documents were stored in iCloud without Apple's permission. This is the first time that Apple has formed a partnership with a local operator for its cloud services.   Other American technology companies have also moved data into China in accordance with the new law. Airbnb said last year that it was moving its user data to a domestic location, citing a need to comply with local laws.   Foreign companies like Apple have had to adapt in other ways to stronger Chinese government scrutiny, often by helping to expand Chinese technological capabilities. For instance, Apple said this year that it would establish two research and development centers in China. Last year, it invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service. Apple has been far more profitable in China than most of its Western peers, but that success has led to pushback from the government. More than a year ago, Apple's iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, six months after they were introduced there.   In December, complying with what it said was a request from the Chinese authorities, Apple removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China. Apple did not specify what had prompted the request. The company also must undergo ''security audits'' on new models of the iPhone before gaining approval to sell them in China.   Even though other American technology giants such as Facebook and Google are blocked in China, Apple has maintained a thriving business in the country by adhering to local rules. It also helps that Apple's smartphones and computers do not carry the same political or security risks as social media platforms and networking equipment.     "
Judge Clears Path for Voter Fraud Panel,"A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for President Trump's commission on voter fraud to proceed in gathering personal data on the nation's voters, denying one of the major legal challenges aimed at stopping the collection effort.  The panel, which was created after the president falsely claimed that millions of illegal votes cost him the popular vote in 2016, has come under siege from many organizations that have filed lawsuits accusing the commission of violating federal privacy laws. The judge's decision on Monday delivered a setback to the opposition, which has objected to the commission's expansive request for the personal and public data about the country's 200 million voters.    The Electronic Privacy Information Center, which filed the suit, sought to stop the commission from acquiring the voter data, claiming that the panel should have conducted a privacy impact assessment before asking states for the personal information. But the judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court, said the panel did not qualify as a federal agency, so it was not required to conduct and publish a privacy assessment.   Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and the vice chairman of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, cheered Judge Kollar-Kotelly's decision. ''This ruling is a major victory for government accountability, transparency and the public's right to know about the integrity of our elections processes,'' Mr. Kobach said in a statement.   Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said his group would continue to closely examine the panel.   ''The commission cannot evade privacy obligations by playing a shell game with the nation's voting records,'' Mr. Rotenberg said in a statement.   Mr. Trump created the commission in May, and it held its first meeting last week. The president started the session by repeating the false claim about the popular vote and said that he had heard stories about voting irregularities, ''in some cases having to do with large numbers of people in certain states.''   The commission, whose chairman is Vice President Mike Pence, has a stated goal of strengthening the country's election systems by searching for fraudulent ballots and improper voter registration. It is expected to deliver a report to Mr. Trump next year.   But critics have assailed the commission as a pretense for a voter-suppression effort to benefit Republicans and said that it will produce a report with exaggerated claims of voter fraud. Studies by state election offices, as well as academic research, have repeatedly concluded that voter fraud is exceedingly rare.   Mr. Kobach, who has claimed that fraud is rampant in his home state and elsewhere, has pushed back against the allegations, saying the commission will break new ground in studying illegal voting ''to find answers to questions that have never been fully answered before.''   Beyond the lawsuits, the White House commission has been met with fierce resistance from states.

Wary of 'Big Brother' in a Digital Privacy Case,"WASHINGTON -- At a lively Supreme Court argument on Wednesday, a majority of the justices seemed troubled by the government's ability to acquire troves of digital data without a warrant. ''Most Americans, I still think, want to avoid Big Brother,'' said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. ''They want to avoid the concept that government will be able to see and locate you anywhere you are, at any point in time.''    The argument lasted 20 minutes longer than the usual hour. By its conclusion, at least five justices seemed prepared to limit the government's power to obtain records from cellphone companies showing their customers' locations over long periods of time. But there was no consensus about a rationale for a decision or about how far the court was prepared to go to reshape longstanding constitutional doctrines that allow the government to obtain business records held by third parties.   The case concerns Timothy Ivory Carpenter, who was convicted of participating in a series of robberies, based in part on records provided by his cellular carrier showing his movements over several months. Nathan Freed Wessler, a lawyer for Mr. Carpenter, said prosecutors had violated the Fourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable searches, by failing to get a warrant for the information.    A ruling in Mr. Carpenter's favor could revise a fundamental Fourth Amendment principle: that people have no reasonable expectation of privacy when they voluntarily turn over information to a third party, like a phone company.   Some justices said they were wary of acting rashly and worried about the consequences of a ruling in favor of Mr. Carpenter.   ''This new technology is raising very serious privacy concerns,'' Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. told Mr. Wessler, ''but I need to know how much of existing precedent you want us to overrule or declare obsolete.''   The court's decision in the case, Carpenter v. United States, No. 16-402, will apply the Fourth Amendment, drafted in the 18th century, to a world in which people's movements are continually recorded by devices in their pockets and cars, by toll plazas and by transit systems.   ''A great many highly sensitive digital records,'' Mr. Wessler said, ''like search queries entered into Google, a person's complete web browsing history showing everything we read online, medical information or fertility tracking data from a smartphone would be vulnerable'' unless the Supreme Court acts.   The justices seemed at odds over how to address the issue. Several said the problem was that the level of detail in Mr. Carpenter's phone records violated his reasonable expectation of privacy. Others, notably Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, took a different approach, saying the problem was that the records were his property and should not have been disclosed without his consent or a warrant.   Michael R. Dreeben, a lawyer for the federal government, urged the justices not to take drastic action. ''The technology here is new,'' he said, ''but the legal principles that this court has articulated under the Fourth Amendment are not.''   Recent Supreme Court decisions have expressed uneasiness with allowing the government to have unfettered access to vast amounts of digital data. The court limited the government's ability to use GPS devices to track suspects' movements in 2012 in United States v. Jones, and it required a warrant to search the cellphones of people placed under arrest in 2014 in Riley v. California.   Justice Elena Kagan said the case concerning GPS devices provided a close analogy to the new case, particularly as cell tower location data becomes more precise. ''In both cases,'' she said, ''you have a new technology that allows for 24/7 tracking and a conclusion by a number of justices in Jones that that was an altogether new and different thing that did intrude on people's expectations of who would be watching them when.''   But the majority in the Jones decision relied on property rights to justify the ruling, saying the police were not entitled to attach a device to a suspect's car. Justice Gorsuch indicated that a similar theory could justify a ruling for Mr. Carpenter.   ''One thing Jones taught us -- and reminded us, really -- is that the property-based approach to privacy also has to be considered, not just the reasonable expectation approach,'' he said.   Older cases have concluded that information turned over to third parties is fair game. In 1979, in Smith v. Maryland, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled that a robbery suspect had no reasonable expectation that his right to privacy extended to the numbers dialed from his landline telephone. In 1976, in United States v. Miller, the court said much the same thing about bank records.   Justice Alito said the earlier decisions tolerated substantial intrusions into privacy. ''Why is cell site location information more sensitive than bank records, particularly today, when a lot of people don't use cash much, if at all?'' he asked. ''It will not only disclose everything that the person buys, it will not only disclose locations, but it will disclose things that can be very sensitive. ''   Mr. Wessler said the location information generated by cell towers was more intrusive. ''Never has the government had this kind of time machine that allows them to aggregate a long period of people's movements over time,'' he said.   Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said it may be a fiction to say that using a cellphone involves a voluntary decision to turn over information to a cellular carrier. ''You really don't have a choice these days if you want to have a cellphone,'' he said.   Justice Sotomayor went further. ''I don't, but I know that most young people have the phones in the bed with them,'' she said. ''I know people who take phones into public restrooms. They take them with them everywhere. It's an appendage now for some people.''   A federal law, the Stored Communications Act, does require prosecutors to go to court to obtain tracking data, but the showing they must make under the law is not probable cause, the standard for a warrant. Instead, they must demonstrate only that there were ''specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe'' that the records sought ''are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.''   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the balance struck by Congress was entitled to deference. ''Why shouldn't we give very significant weight to the Congress's determination?'' he asked.   Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who seemed inclined to vote for Mr. Carpenter, worried that the court's decision could be too sweeping, imperiling all sorts of investigations.   Several justices questioned whether people using cellphones know that they are leaving a digital trail of their whereabouts over time. Justice Kennedy said it was common knowledge.   ''If I know it,'' he said, ''everybody does.''   Follow Adam Liptak on Twitter: @adamliptak.     "
Digital Currencies Are Growing on Crumbling Foundations,"One of the chief strengths of digital currencies is becoming their weakness. Freedom from regulation was the big draw of Bitcoin, Ether and their counterparts. But the exchanges set up to trade them often lack basic controls over identity, fraud, technology and even trading volume, a Reuters investigation shows.     Without fixes, such weaknesses will consign those currencies to the financial fringe.   These markets can be vulnerable to hacking. For instance, the exchange Kraken suffered a denial-of-service network interruption in May, during which the price of ether on its platform dropped 70 percent. Such reactions can be intensified by a lack of circuit breakers that halt trading.   Virtual heists are common, too, according to the Reuters special report. About 980,000 Bitcoins have been stolen in at least 36 incidents since 2011. At current rates, that's worth $4 billion.   Some exchanges also fail to demand the most basic security checks and know-your-client procedures that more traditional venues insist on. The Poloniex exchange asked some users to supply only a name, email address and country of operation. And some Chinese exchanges have inflated deal flow to attract business, according to former employees.   Such drawbacks have not averted a marked increase in interest over the last few months. The total market value of all digital currencies was $140 billion on Sept. 18, according the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein, a more than tenfold increase over 12 months. Bitcoin accounts for around half the total value -- and its price has surged 10 percent again in the last 10 days.   It smells like bubble territory, with volatility making it even riskier.   Speculators may like the wild swings, including the former Fortress executive Mike Novogratz, who is raising a $500 million digital-currency hedge fund. But that state of affairs attracts criminals, too. Digital-currency cases now account for three-quarters of the time the Federal Bureau of Investigation devotes fighting money laundering, it revealed at a recent Morgan Stanley event. The law enforcement agency also said that most ransom payments are now demanded in Bitcoin or one of its rivals.   But it is the lack of a solid market structure that worries people like JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who recently argued that Bitcoin was ''worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well.'' He concluded, ''It's a fraud.''   Dispelling that widespread notion will require the exchanges to raise their games greatly.

Sticking With Windows 7,"Q. I am satisfied with Windows 7 and don't wish to upgrade to Windows 10. Would a problem arise if I continue to use Windows 7, even after Microsoft stops sending updates for Windows 7?  A. Microsoft stopped all official sales of the last available version of Windows 7 on Oct. 30 and began counting down to the end of its support for the operating system, originally released in 2009. The company has published the dates for milestones in the Windows 7 life cycle, and has moved from ''mainstream support,'' in which new features are developed and added as updates, to ''extended support,'' which mainly provides security patches.    Extended support for Windows 7 is scheduled to end on Jan. 14, 2020. Certain third-party security software companies may provide their own updates for Windows 7 after Microsoft stops, so you might be able to keep using the system for a few more years with protection against malicious software. (Despite protection, though, security flaws in the older operating system may also be hard to fix.)   As long as you are happy with Windows 7 and the programs you run on it continue to work, you can probably keep using the system as you do now. However, as software companies release newer versions of their applications and as web technologies continue to evolve, you may find that your Windows 7 computer runs slower and acts more erratically than it once did.   Though you have a few years before Microsoft ends its support for Windows 7, it is a good idea to have a reliable backup plan now -- if you do not already. Even if the software is outdated (but functional), hard drives and other components have been known to wear out and fail with age.

Proposed Sale to Disney Complicates Murdoch Succession Plan,"For a while, Rupert Murdoch seemed invincible. First, the mogul emerged relatively unscathed from a 2011 phone hacking scandal involving his British tabloids that threatened to upend his empire. Then, he installed his sons, Lachlan and James, in leadership roles at 21st Century Fox. And, last year, the thrice-divorced Mr. Murdoch married Jerry Hall, a former supermodel 25 years his junior.    But even Mr. Murdoch, a self-made billionaire whose range of media assets wield enormous political influence on three continents, was no match for Silicon Valley.   Like King Lear confronting his mortality, Mr. Murdoch, 86, is preparing to divide up a lifetime of spoils. And as he moves to sell off wide swaths of his media and entertainment business, he is also throwing into confusion the line of succession and testing the ties that bind the family-run fief.    The Walt Disney Company announced on Thursday it had reached a deal to acquire most of 21st Century Fox Inc., the Murdoch-owned company that includes the storied movie and television studio, national cable networks like FX and National Geographic, 22 regional cable channels dedicated to sports and a 39 percent stake in Britain's pay TV service, Sky.   The $52.4 billion deal -- which would not include Fox News, the Fox broadcast network or the FS1 sports cable channel, which will be spun off into a newly listed company -- has come about as part of the consolidation sweeping over traditional media companies as they try to fight off threats from Amazon, Apple and Netflix. It also represents a remarkable shift for Mr. Murdoch, a visionary businessman who has long lived by a single credo: Buy, buy, buy.   After all, Mr. Murdoch didn't grow a single newspaper in Adelaide, Australia, into a $100 billion media business by selling. ''Rupert has always been a collector, a builder,'' said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company.   In 2007, when newspapers were facing a decline, Mr. Murdoch defied Wall Street investors and his own advisers to pay $5 billion for Dow Jones, the company that publishes The Wall Street Journal. Why? Because he wanted to.   In 2012, under pressure in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, Mr. Murdoch split his entertainment assets into a separate publicly traded company, 21st Century Fox, from News Corporation, the company that includes The Journal, the New York Post and other newspapers. For a time Mr. Murdoch's enterprise looked like an entertainment company with a newspaper problem, with glitzy Hollywood assets and lucrative Fox News keeping Mr. Murdoch's true love, printed papers, afloat.   But 21st Century Fox soon faced the same economic headwinds affecting other traditional media companies that have been disrupted by the rise of digital: customers cut the cable cord and streamed TV shows and movies on multiple devices. At the same time, Fox News, the highly rated basic cable channel and a big moneymaker, has suffered setbacks after a series of sexual harassment allegations at the network led to high-level departures and costly legal settlements.   Mr. Murdoch must have known he needed to get even bigger to survive. But lately his buying prowess has taken a hit. In 2014, investors rebuffed him when he tried to gain scale with an $80 billion offer for Time Warner Inc., the company that owns HBO and CNN -- and which may end up the property of AT&T, if a deal long in the making survives the scrutiny of a skeptical Justice Department. Regulatory hassles have also thwarted Mr. Murdoch's efforts to pay $15 billion for the 61 percent stake in Sky not already owned by 21st Century Fox.   ''He tried to buy, and when that didn't work, he doesn't sulk -- he sells,'' Ms. Martin said.   Disney's planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox -- Mr. Murdoch's confidants call it a merger -- makes economic sense, analysts say, and may be the best way for Mr. Murdoch's broader empire to thrive. But it also makes the identity of his heir less apparent.   Mr. Murdoch's younger son, James, 44, has reinvented himself since an intense legal imbroglio in Britain that sprang up after the News of the World tabloid hacked into the voice mail of a 13-year-old murder victim. James Murdoch, who is said to be supportive of the Disney deal, left his post in London, moved to the United States and took over one of his father's jobs: chief executive of 21st Century Fox.   Lachlan Murdoch, the elder brother at 46, has been caricatured as the prodigal son. He left the family business in 2005 and was happily living out of the fray in Australia, with a supermodel wife and a trust fund. But as part of Mr. Murdoch's succession plan, Lachlan returned to the United States in 2015 to serve with his younger brother -- and alongside his father, as co-executive chairman -- at 21st Century Fox. Seen by some insiders as a daddy's boy, he moved into his father's former office on the company's palm-tree-lined lot in Beverly Hills.   Questions abound about which son would carry on the family legacy, should the Disney deal go through. (Mr. Murdoch's older daughters, Prudence and Elisabeth, have stayed mostly out of the business, and his younger daughters, Grace and Chloe, are teenagers.)   ''You have this issue with two sons who are seemingly capable of commercial success and, if you're Rupert, you want to leave them both in a good spot, for lack of a better spot,'' said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.   In one possible outcome, James Murdoch would take on an executive position at Disney, and Lachlan Murdoch, who shares his father's passion for news, would move to News Corporation or oversee the company that absorbs Fox News and the Fox broadcast channel.   ''The Disney deal gives Lachlan a clear run to manage the remnants,'' said Neil Chenoweth, an Australian financial journalist and author of ''Rupert Murdoch: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Media Wizard.''   A company insider who could only discuss ongoing deal negotiations anonymously said it was too early to know what roles the Murdoch sons would take on, and added that James Murdoch could decide to strike out on his own.   Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, has agreed to stay on after his planned retirement in 2019. Analysts widely agreed that, despite speculation, James Murdoch would not be in serious contention for Mr. Iger's job.   Unlike Sumner Redstone, the 94-year-old billionaire magnate behind Viacom and CBS Corp. who lusted after Paramount Studios and the red-carpet prestige of owning a movie studio, Mr. Murdoch has always been more enamored with ink-stained newsrooms.   The Disney deal would leave him without a seat at the Dolby Theater for the Academy Awards -- a string of Fox Searchlight Pictures films including ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' ''12 Years a Slave'' and ''Birdman'' have won best picture Oscars -- but Mr. Murdoch would maintain his seat at the White House. In August, the family patriarch had a private dinner with President Trump; Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser; and the White House chief of staff John F. Kelly.   Mr. Murdoch talks regularly with Mr. Kushner, who knows a thing or two about tiptoeing around powerful family business dynamics. People close to Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Kushner described them as friends, but others saw a transactional relationship.   ''Rupert is a guy who doesn't have friends,'' said Mr. Chenoweth, the Murdoch biographer.   Mr. Trump, meanwhile, remains tethered to Fox News and fixated on The Journal's editorial page. During the 2016 Republican primary, he desperately sought Mr. Murdoch's approval, despite the mogul's skepticism of both his presidential bid and his business bona fides. ''When is Donald Trump going to stop embarrassing his friends, let alone the whole country?'' Mr. Murdoch wrote on Twitter after Mr. Trump mocked Senator John McCain of Arizona for having been captured during the Vietnam War.   Mr. Murdoch's news properties will allow him to maintain the political influence that he has cultivated.   ''I think he's keeping his passion projects,'' said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield.   As for his sons, people close to Mr. Murdoch do not envision a scenario in which either James or Lachlan thrives long-term at the top of a company that doesn't have their father's stamp on the door.   In a joint memo to employees sent last week, James and Lachlan tried to quell concerns about the sale. ''Uncertainty,'' they wrote, ''always breeds unease.''     "
What to Do When Chrome Wants to Update -- but Can't,"Q. I get a message when I open Chrome and use Gmail or Facebook every day that says that my Chrome version is out of date and that I need to upgrade. When I go to Chrome to check the version, it says I have the latest one. Why do I keep getting these messages?  A. Update hiccups with Google Chrome can happen for a number of reasons, but start by checking that your computer's operating system meets the requirements for the latest version of the browser. For the current version of Chrome, you need at least Windows 7, Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or 64-bit editions of the major Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE or Fedora) that were released in the past few years.    If your operating system is outdated, Chrome may have moved on without it. Windows users should check the browser's Properties box to make sure the program isn't set to run in compatibility mode for an earlier version of the system. Those using Chrome on an office network may be at the mercy of the corporate I.T. department as to when updates can actually be installed on company computers. Firewall settings and other security software could also prevent Chrome from updating properly.   Adware or malware may be another source of the problem, with variations of the ''Urgent Chrome Update'' pop-up plaguing some users as it tries to hijack the browser. Scanning your system with antivirus and antimalware software may root out the source of the messages.   If none of these issues seems to be causing the problem, uninstalling the browser and reinstalling it with a fresh copy might take care of the situation. You can get the latest version of Google Chrome at www.google.com/chrome. Be sure to restart after you install the software.

Shhh! That Helpful Robot May Pose a Security Risk,"SAN FRANCISCO -- In the coming age of robotics, many of those autonomous machines will be internet-connected and mobile. What could possibly go wrong?    Significant security flaws were found in an examination of six home and industrial robots, according to a report to be released Wednesday by IOActive, a computer security consulting firm with headquarters in Seattle. The report notes that only four of the six companies responded to the firm's alert, and only two said they planned to make patches after being informed of the problems.   The researchers, who described the categories of vulnerabilities they had discovered in the report but not the specific flaws, said their research was simply an early reconnaissance of the field.    ''It's important to note that our testing was not even a deep, extensive security audit, as that would have taken a much larger investment of time and resources,'' the authors wrote. ''The goal for this work was to gain a high-level sense of how insecure today's robots are, which we accomplished.''   Despite the general nature of the report, industry specialists warn that if robot makers fail to take a security-first approach, it may haunt them.   ''The desire for online commerce brought strong cryptographic algorithms into our daily lives,'' said Joe Britt, the chief executive of Afero, a Los Altos, Calif.-based maker of secure communications systems for the world of so-called embedded computing. ''As embedded systems for sensors and robotics flourish in the next wave of computing, failure to apply these proven safeguards is like leaving the locks off of our doors.''   The research underscores the potential security challenges that await the world of mobile robots. Given the popularity of stationary home robotic systems like Amazon's Echo and Google's Home personal assistants as well as dozens of other internet-connected devices like doorbells, video cameras and even light bulbs, it appears that consumers are willing to trust that manufacturers are building adequate security into the products.   It is common for manufacturers that do not have good security practices to not know how to deal with vulnerability reports. Most of them probably do not have a procedure in place to handle reports and neither to provide security fixes to customers.   Robots are widely used in manufacturing. But they are largely systems like robot arms that do not have autonomous functions and cannot move around in the environment.   There is a growing consensus that during the next decade, advances in artificial intelligence will make it possible for robots to move freely in unstructured environments. This will bring self-driving cars closer to reality and will also lead to a generation of machines that will operate autonomously in homes, offices and factories.   The authors of the new report challenged the robotics industry, saying that not enough attention was being given to well-known security issues that have proved devastating for existing commercial computer networks.   ''We call it an internet-of-things with arms and legs and wheels,'' said Cesar Cerrudo, chief technology officer of IOActive. ''The surface of attack is huge. Each robot has multiple ways it can be compromised.''   The researchers said that robot makers were rushing their products to market without giving adequate consideration to security.   ''Vendors like to add features that please the public,'' said Lucas Apa, a senior security consultant at IOActive and one of the authors of the report. ''They forget about important issues. Robots can have microphones and cameras; they can walk and they can grab objects. People don't realize the consequences of something that can grab an object or can hear or see you.''   The report identifies security flaws in a number of robots, including NAO and Pepper home robots made by SoftBank Robotics; and manufacturing robots from Universal Robots and Rethink Robotics, two makers of robot arms that are intended to collaborate with human workers in assembly line applications. It also identifies flaws in small humanoid robots made by UBTECH Robotics and Robotis, and in robotics software developed by Asratec Corp.   The report identifies seven different kinds of security issues, ranging from weak cryptographic systems and vulnerable default configurations to what security experts call authentication issues.   In some cases, they noted that it was possible to control some robot functions without authentication.   ''We found key robot services that didn't require a username and password, allowing anyone to remotely access those services,'' the report said.   One of the robot manufacturers identified by the report disputed the findings. Two of the criticisms leveled by the researchers actually involved ''features'' added for research and education markets, according to Gil Haylon, a Rethink Robotics spokesman. He added that other vulnerabilities had been ''phased out'' in the latest software release for the company's Baxter and Sawyer robots, which are intended for light assembly operations.   Universal Robots said it was looking into the issue raised by the researchers. The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.     "
Protecting Your Data When Using Browser Extensions,"Q. I was installing a browser extension the other day, and the software said it needed to ''read and change all the data on the websites you visit.'' Why is this, and should I be worried?  A. Browser extensions meant to perform tasks -- like finding coupon deals or stopping videos from automatically playing -- are programs all on their own. Web browsers that use a permissions system to explain what data the extension needs to function should alert you to what the program wants to do and, as with app permissions on mobile devices, give you a chance to stop installing the software if its reach seems too invasive.    In theory, an extension that has license to ''read and change all the data on the websites you visit'' can see the sites you browse, make changes to those pages and report back to its creator with the information. Some extensions legitimately require access to this data to perform their function. For example, video-blocking software must read a website's code to see that a clip is set to play automatically -- so it knows how to stop the playback.   Many extensions benignly use this information, but there is always the danger that the all-access pass will be abused or that rogue software will grab keystrokes, login information, account numbers and other private data. Malware makers have hijacked or even bought legitimate extensions from their original developers and used the access to pump invasive advertisements into web pages; Google previously banned these offenders from its Chrome extension store.   The creators of Honey, a popular shopping extension that requires permission to ''read and change'' the data on the websites you visit, have said that they have been approached by malware and data collection companies about selling their trusted software -- but that they have not done so. Many add-on programs quietly do their jobs without grabbing your data, but if online privacy and security concern you at all, consider skipping the convenience of the browser extension, or thoroughly read its creator's privacy policy so you know what you are agreeing to share when you install the software.

Top State Court Deals Facebook a Setback,"New York State's highest court dealt a blow to Facebook and other social media companies seeking to expand privacy protections, ruling on Tuesday that Facebook had no right to ask an appellate court to quash search warrants ordering the company to hand over information from hundreds of accounts in a disability fraud case. The state Court of Appeals, in a 5-to-1 decision, with one judge recusing himself, upheld lower court rulings that New York law does not allow a social media company to appeal a judge's decision to issue search warrants in a criminal case, even if the company believes those warrants violate the constitutional rights of its users.     The Facebook case is part of a broader battle between the government and technology companies over the limits on law enforcement requests for data under the federal Stored Communications Act. Much of that fight is playing out in New York.   The ruling was a setback for civil libertarians and social media companies hoping the court might create new legal guidelines for search warrants aimed at seizing all the information in electronic accounts, treating them more like civil subpoenas, which can be challenged as overly broad before they are executed.   But Judge Leslie E. Stein, writing for the majority, said state courts had held for decades that search warrants issued by judges cannot be appealed to a higher court. Instead, they may be challenged by a defendant only during a pretrial hearing, as illegal searches.   ''Indeed, to hold otherwise would be to impermissibly and judicially create a right to appeal in a criminal matter that has not been authorized by our Legislature,'' Judge Stein wrote in her 25-page decision.   She acknowledged that Facebook had presented the court with ''novel and important substantive issues regarding the constitutional rights of privacy and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure'' but said the court was ''constrained by law'' to dismiss the company's appeal. Because search warrants cannot be appealed, she said, the court did not need to rule on Facebook's central contention -- that the warrants were so sweeping they amounted to an unconstitutional search.   One judge dissented: Judge Rowan D. Wilson, who argued that the federal law authorizing the warrants -- the Stored Communications Act of 1986 -- did not distinguish between warrants and subpoenas. In his reading, that statute gives service providers a right to appeal all overly broad court orders, including search warrants. ''State rules of procedures applicable to garden-variety warrants cannot be used as a device to contravene or frustrate federal law,'' he wrote.   Judge Wilson noted that the framers of the State Constitution in 1938 had specifically warned against the invasion of privacy in electronic communications. ''The New York Constitution commands us to guard vigilantly against that evil,'' he said. He characterized the warrants as ''authorizing the seizure of private information en masse,'' including deleted content and content shared by users not under investigation.   The case -- known formally as In Re 381 Search Warrants Directed to Facebook Inc. -- had been closely watched as a test as Facebook sought to expand its ability to fight what it sees as fishing expeditions by prosecutors. Several tech giants, including Google, LinkedIn, Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter, filed amicus briefs, as did the New York Civil Liberties Union.   The search warrants were signed in 2013 by Justice Melissa C. Jackson on the strength of a 96-page affidavit that has never been made public. In an unusual procedure, Facebook moved to quash the warrants, saying they were too broad and objecting to the judge's order prohibiting the company from telling its clients about them.   Judge Jackson denied the motion, saying Facebook, as a service provider, could not argue the searches were unconstitutional on behalf of its clients, any more than a landlord could stop the police with a warrant from searching a storage facility. She also said there was enough evidence of fraud to justify the mass warrants.   The warrants ordered Facebook to turn over all of the information in the accounts of 381 people, including private photos and conversations. That information was used by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to obtain indictments for disability fraud against more than 130 police officers and other former public employees. None of the people indicted challenged the search warrants.   Mr. Vance personally argued the case before the court, underscoring its importance to his office, which has used private information in Facebook accounts not only as evidence of the enormous disability fraud scheme but also to help make conspiracy cases against hundreds of members of street gangs in housing projects.   One of the concurring judges, Jenny Rivera, wrote a separate opinion, saying she agreed with the majority but on the narrower grounds that Facebook had not made the right arguments under federal law for quashing the warrants: that they would cause an undue burden and harm its business. Judge Rivera said she agreed with Judge Wilson that the federal law permitted Facebook to appeal a judge's decision on search warrants to a higher court.   Jay Nancarrow, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company had yet to decide whether to take its case to the federal courts.   ''We're disappointed by the court's ruling,'' he said. ''But we are encouraged to see the thorough dissent that supports Facebook's position arguing for people's online privacy.''   Donna Leiberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said she was heartened the court ruled only on procedural grounds, leaving the constitutional battle for another day.   ''This ruling does not reject our important claim that the state and federal Constitution do not permit district attorneys to rummage around in people's Facebook accounts like they did here,'' Ms. Leiberman said.     "
A Privacy Shield That Comes With a Cost,"When Congress voted to overturn online privacy rules last week, Steve Wilmot, a Los Angeles songwriter, reacted like many worried consumers: He looked into signing up for a technology service known as a virtual private network, or VPN. The online privacy rules, which were set to go into effect this year and which President Trump fully repealed on Monday, would have required broadband providers like Comcast and Charter to get permission from customers before selling their browsing history to advertisers. Without restrictions, the companies can track and sell people's information with greater ease.    A VPN was a natural service to consider in response. That's because the technology creates a virtual tunnel that shields your browsing information from your internet service provider. So Mr. Wilmot researched VPNs in hopes of protecting his own browsing data.   ''I don't really want anybody to have any sort of access to what I'm looking at,'' he said. ''If anyone is going to profit off my privacy, I'd prefer it to be me.''    But while VPNs are worth considering, they are an incomplete and flawed solution. For one thing, they often slow down internet speeds significantly. Some apps and services may also stop working properly when you are connected to a virtual network.   Still, VPNs are among several tools for better protecting your digital privacy. Here's an overview of the pros and cons, based on tests of VPN services and interviews with security experts.   Why go with a VPN?   When you browse the web, a broadband provider helps route your device's internet traffic to each destination website. Each device you use has an identifier consisting of a string of numbers, also known as an IP address. When you are on the internet, a service provider can see which devices you use and which sites you visit.   VPNs help cloak your browsing information from your internet provider. When you use VPN software, your device connects to a VPN provider's servers. That way, all your web traffic passes through the VPN provider's internet connection. So if your internet provider was trying to listen in on your web traffic, all it would see is the VPN server's IP address connected to the VPN service.   ''We provide you an encrypted tunnel from you to us,'' said Sean Sullivan, a security adviser for F-Secure, a Finland-based company that offers a VPN called Freedome.   VPNs are especially handy when you are connecting to a public Wi-Fi network with which you aren't familiar. For example, when you use public Wi-Fi at a cafe, airport or hotel, it's often unclear who the service provider is and what its data collection policies entail. In this scenario, a VPN is highly recommended.   VPNs also have the ability to make it appear as though your device is connecting from a different location. So if you are in Europe, traveling to Spain from France, and want to stream content that is only viewable in France, you could connect to a VPN server whose IP address is in France.   Does a VPN have any downsides?   VPN services have their downsides, and the biggest one is speed degradation. Because your internet traffic passes through a VPN provider's connection, you will likely see a dip in broadband performance.   Speeds will vary depending on the VPN provider's infrastructure. In my tests with a Mac, download speeds dropped about 85 percent after connecting to F-Secure's Freedome VPN service, and by 50 percent when connected to another VPN service called Private Internet Access. In other words, if you are downloading large files over a VPN, it will take much longer to accomplish those tasks.   Another drawback is that VPN services cost money. F-Secure charges $4.17 a month to use its service for a year on three devices, and Private Internet Access charges $6.95 per month or $40 a year on five devices. That's not a lot of money, but broadband service is generally expensive, and tacking on a few extra dollars a month to use the internet more privately can be annoying.   In addition, some services may not work properly on a VPN. Netflix often blocks them to keep people from streaming content that is not licensed for their regions. In tests with Freedome and Private Internet Access, I tried connecting to a server in Mexico to stream the catalog of Netflix movies available there. With both VPN services, Netflix detected I was using a VPN and prevented movies from playing.   For VPN providers, this is a known issue. F-Secure's Mr. Sullivan said that when services like Netflix block VPNs, they are probably ''putting up a fight for Hollywood.''   Which VPNs are worth a try?   There are hundreds of VPNs on the market, and vetting them can be overwhelming.   Runa Sandvik, a director of information security for The New York Times, said that consumers should be scrupulous about reading privacy policies and selecting a VPN they can trust. That's because a VPN service is also tied to an internet service provider, meaning a VPN provider could share your information with the service provider if it wanted to do so.   With that in mind, Ms. Sandvik highlighted F-Secure's Freedome as a trustworthy VPN provider. The Wirecutter, a product recommendations site owned by The Times,  picked Private Internet Access because it has the hallmarks of a trustworthy service, available at a low cost.   Based on those recommendations, I tried Private Internet Access and Freedome for my tests. Both products were easy to use: Just install an app on your smartphone, computer or tablet and hit a button to connect to a server. In the end, I preferred Private Internet Access because of its faster speeds.   What's the VPN bottom line?   All things considered, VPN is only a partial solution for keeping your browsing data private.   Even if you hide your activities from your internet provider, web companies like Facebook and Google can use tracking technologies like cookies, which contain unique alphanumeric identification tags, to identify your activities as you move from site to site. Beyond that, web trackers often lurk inside ads.   ''The real problem is ads are dangerous,'' said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company. ''They're fully functioning programs and they carry malware.''   If you are truly concerned about keeping your web browsing history private, Mr. Grossman recommended using a combination of a VPN and an ad blocker. His ad blocker of choice is uBlock Origin, a free piece of software. For those who would prefer not to block ads, there are tracker blockers as well -- my favorite is Disconnect.   With VPNs, most people would probably be better off using them when it seems necessary -- and turning them off when they are not needed. The slowdown in speed is the biggest negative and makes constant use impractical.   Many people would probably benefit from using a VPN in certain situations, like when they are connected to a public Wi-Fi network or are browsing sensitive websites. But for watching Netflix or sending emails with large attachments? Turn the VPN off.   For Mr. Wilmot, the Los Angeles musician, the slow speeds of internet downloading spurred by VPNs were a dealbreaker. In the end, he opted against getting one at all.   ''If I don't have lightning-fast internet 24 hours a day, it inhibits my workflow and affects deadlines,'' he said. ''I think I'm accidentally relaxing into that kind of 'What can you do?' mentality. There's no good option.''   Email: brian.chen@nytimes.com; Twitter: @bxchen.     "
"Facebook, Despite Ban, Seeks Foothold in China","SHANGHAI -- Facebook is blocked in China, but it is feeling comfortable enough there to look for its own place. The social media giant in recent months has quietly scouted for office space in Shanghai, according to two people with knowledge of its efforts there. Those offices would house employees working on Facebook's effort to make hardware but could also help with its broader ambitions in China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the plans.    Facebook's plans are tentative, the people said, and would depend on approval from the Chinese government. But if successful, it would be a symbolic victory for the social network, which has long worked to get into China despite being blocked there for nearly a decade.    ''We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,'' a Facebook spokeswoman said in response to questions about the office plans.   Facebook has been looking for momentum in China, home of the world's largest population of online users. Earlier this year, it quietly authorized the release by a small local company of a Chinese version of its Moments photo-managing app.   Despite being obstructed in China, Facebook has many reasons to continue pursuing business there. The social network sells advertising to Chinese companies hoping to reach the rest of the world. The Chinese ad sales, supported from its office in Hong Kong, are some of the largest in Asia. Even China's government propaganda organs use it.   Facebook's new hardware ambitions would require a Chinese presence as well. The initiatives would require plugging into China's electronics supply chain, which helps build some of the world's most popular gadgets, like Apple's iPhone. The office would first be used by employees of Facebook's hardware effort, called Building 8, according to the people with knowledge of the plans. Anything from an internet-connected medical device to a drone requires coordination with dozens of Chinese producers and assemblers, mostly located in the southern part of the country.   Facebook has for years entertained the idea of a Chinese office. In late 2015, it obtained a license to open an office in Beijing, but the permit lasted only three months and it could not establish a space in that time. Oculus, the virtual reality company Facebook bought three years ago, already has a Shanghai office.   At the moment, Facebook uses third parties and its own employees to sell ads in China. Because of cybersecurity concerns, Facebook employees run special security software on devices when they travel in China and do not have access to secretive or critical business information.   Opening an office in Shanghai allows more support for its employees when they are in China, but also raises security questions. The Building 8 teams, which focus on their own hardware projects, would have less need to access sensitive Facebook data when in China, one person said. The office could also help Facebook work more with local Chinese companies.   If it opens a Shanghai office, Facebook would not be the only Western internet company banned in the country to have some space there. Google, which pulled its servers out of China in 2010 after it decided to stop censoring search results, retained offices in Beijing and Shanghai that support both advertising and research and development. Google still maintains extensive advertising sales and research facilities there.   Facebook over the past three years has pulled out all the stops to court the Chinese government and gain approval for its network. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, has showed off his Mandarin at one of the country's top universities and has directly courted Xi Jinping, China's president.   The office search comes just months after Facebook released the Chinese-language version of Moments. That app, called Colorful Balloons, originally went largely unnoticed but briefly rose into the top 50 in the photo and video section of China's iPhone app store after The New York Times reported its release last month, according to app research company App Annie.   Like other cities in China, Shanghai has been eager to attract technology start-ups and other internet-related investments.   Earlier this year, a woman listed as the executive director of the company that released Colorful Balloons on Facebook's behalf was photographed at a meeting between Shanghai government officials and Facebook. In order to open an office in Shanghai, Facebook will likely have to register a branch company in Shanghai as well.   That the Colorful Balloons app has not come down could be a sign that Facebook has done something right with the government, said Teng Bingsheng, a professor at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. Opening an office, if it happens, would be another sign.   ''It has symbolic meaning,'' Mr. Teng said, ''because it must be the result of good communication with the government.''

States Seek to Step In on Privacy for Web,"Now that Republicans are in charge, the federal government is poised to roll back regulations limiting access to consumers' online data. States have other ideas. As on climate change, immigration and a host of other issues, some state legislatures may prove to be a counterweight to Washington by enacting new regulations to increase consumers' privacy rights.    Illinois legislators are considering a ''right to know'' bill that would let consumers find out what information about them is collected by companies like Google and Facebook, and what kinds of businesses they share it with. Such a right, which European consumers already have, has been a longtime goal of privacy advocates.    Two other proposals face a crucial Illinois House committee vote this week. One would regulate when consumers' locations can be tracked by smartphone applications, and another would limit the use of microphones in internet-connected devices like mobile phones, smart TVs and personal assistants like Amazon's Echo.   Should they be passed into law, these rules could end up guiding the rights of consumers far beyond Illinois -- because they would provide a model for other states, and because it would be difficult for technology companies with hundreds of millions of users to create a patchwork of state- and country-specific features to localize their effects.   Congress is pushing to overturn regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration that limit the collection of data by broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast. The Senate approved the rollback last week, and the House is expected to follow this week.   Congressional Republicans argue that the rules would add an unneeded and confusing layer of regulation and that they fail to distinguish between broadband providers and content companies like Facebook and Google. They also assert, more broadly, that such regulation is onerous and stifles innovation.   Illinois is not the only place where state legislators are asserting themselves in the opposite direction.   California and Connecticut, for instance, recently updated laws that restrict government access to online communications like email, and New Mexico could follow soon. Last year, Nebraska and West Virginia passed laws that limit how companies can monitor employees' social media accounts, while legislators in Hawaii, Missouri and elsewhere are pushing similar bills for employees, as well as for students and tenants.   ''More and more, states have taken the position that, if Congress is not willing or able to enact strong privacy laws, their legislatures will no longer sit on their hands,'' said Chad Marlow, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union.   Online privacy is the rare issue that draws together legislators from the left and the far right. At the state level, anyway, some of the progress has come from a marriage between progressive Democrats and libertarian-minded Republicans, who see privacy as a bedrock principle, Mr. Marlow said.   States have often been a kind of regulatory laboratory. Be it tax cuts, emission regulations, gay rights or gun laws, advocates on both the left and the right have long worked at the state level to push agendas that Washington is too busy or hostile to handle.   In the case of online privacy, consumer groups and civil liberties advocates had a friendly ear in many quarters of the Obama administration. Now they face a White House and a Congress that are looking to roll back regulations, not create them.   But federal blockage can create local opportunities.   ''What you're seeing is this growing recognition of the intrusiveness of these technologies, and some efforts -- not to regulate them out of existence, but to regulate them in ways that allow people who care about this to preserve their own privacy,'' said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, and the former director of the Federal Trade Commission's consumer protection bureau. ''So what's going to happen is California is going to supplant Congress, and it's going to be augmented by states like Illinois, Minnesota and even Texas in efforts to protect consumer privacy.''   In Illinois, the ''right to know'' legislation recently cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, paving the way for a full vote sometime in the next few weeks. Technology companies and their trade organizations are lobbying fiercely against it.   ''I think I created 30 jobs when I filed this bill,'' said Michael Hastings, a Democratic state senator who sponsored the measure.   Mr. Hastings said lobbyists representing companies including Microsoft, Apple, Lyft and Amazon had visited his office to talk about amending the bill. Several technology trade groups, including the Internet Association and NetChoice, have pushed publicly against the legislation.   In an interview, Carl Szabo, senior policy counsel at NetChoice, said the law could add a burden of compliance costs and legal fees on essentially any company with a website that collects information, even routine things like creating email lists or giving online support to customers.   ''Hiring attorneys to write privacy policies, coming up with terms of service -- that will be a real burden for small businesses,'' he said.   Illinois also has another dimension: class-action lawyers. Almost a decade ago the state passed a trailblazing law, the Biometric Information Privacy Act, that regulates the collection of things like facial scans, voice data and thumbprints. This has given rise to a series of potentially expensive lawsuits against Facebook, Google and others.   Last year, lobbyists for Facebook failed in a push for an amendment that would have weakened the biometric law by exempting photo-tagging technologies that are now commonly used on social media.   In the interim, however, lawyers at Edelson PC, a Chicago-based class-action firm that has become notorious among tech companies for its prolific filing of privacy suits, have gone on offense with a lobbying campaign of their own. Firm lawyers have also helped found a new nonprofit group, the Digital Privacy Alliance, as an advocate for privacy legislation in Illinois and elsewhere.   ''We were forced to get involved politically because once we started winning a lot of cases in court, they all went on the offensive,'' said Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC. ''It's important because the Trump administration is doing so much to roll back privacy rights, so there is going to be a huge shift to state lawmakers and state attorneys general.''     "
Accounting Giant PwC Will Open U.S. Law Firm To Serve Multinationals,"Law firms already elbowing one another for multinational clients will soon have a new competitor: The Big Four accounting firm PwC, formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, plans to open a law firm in Washington, D.C., next week.  The law firm, ILC Legal, will advise clients on international matters such as corporate restructuring. Its lawyers will act as special legal consultants, rather than fully licensed United States lawyers, allowing them to provide counsel on foreign law but not United States law.    ILC Legal, nonetheless, aims to vie with big law firms as a one-stop shop offering multinational companies access to other PwC services, including tax consulting and its network of 3,200 lawyers spread across 90 countries. The firms in that network operate separately but follow the same standards and practices under the PwC brand name.   ''We won't be a traditional law firm, where legal services are offered in isolation, but one part of a broader offering,'' said Richard J. Edmundson, a British solicitor based in London who is PwC's leader of international business reorganizations.   Mr. Edmundson will lead the new firm. ''There will be five international lawyers and myself, from London,'' he said in a phone interview on Friday. ''They are Spanish, Canadian, Polish and German attorneys who have been practicing at PwC network member firms outside of the U.S.''   Another advantage of opening ILC Legal in Washington is its proximity to clients based in the United States, Mr. Edmundson said. ''We can talk to them in real time and put them in contact with others more easily,'' he said.   ILC Legal hopes to attract multinational companies seeking counsel in areas like digital security and data protection, dispute resolution, international corporate structuring, and mergers and acquisitions, Mr. Edmundson said. It will operate like a traditional law firm, soliciting clients and billing them directly for services.   Although overall client demand for legal services is flat and corporations are increasingly handling routine business internally, Mr. Edmundson said he hoped ILC Legal would eventually add more international lawyers. ''We hope it will grow,'' he said.   PwC is not the only accounting giant offering legal services. Deloitte, KPMG and Ernst & Young, now known as EY, also have more than 2,000 lawyers each.   ''The difference is that PwC is the first to create a separate legal entity,'' said Jeffrey Lowe, the law firm practice group leader at Major, Lindsey & Africa, a legal recruiting firm in New York.   Traditional law firms can take some solace in the restrictions that ILC Legal must follow in the United States. Current law generally does not allow accounting firms to provide nonauditing services, including legal services, to companies they audit. That means ILC Legal can provide services only to companies that are not PwC auditing clients.   PwC's decision to open a law firm in the United States, which was first disclosed this week in The American Lawyer, faced another restriction: Most American jurisdictions prohibit nonlawyers from owning or operating law firms or sharing fees with nonlawyers. Washington, however, does not ban firms owned by nonlawyers.     "
Apple Provides Hedge Against Tech Backlash,"Authorities worldwide are growing worried that Facebook, Google and Amazon are eroding privacy, using data to push rivals out of business and even affecting elections. This is one tech battle Apple can sit out. As a security-minded purveyor of hardware, it's likely to avoid the worst of the blowback.  Europe will be the eye of the tech storm in 2018. The European Commission has already fined Google $2.8 billion for favoring its own services and burying rivals in search results. Regulators are deciding whether the Alphabet's Android mobile operating system gives it another means of unfairly promoting its businesses. A bigger fine and reduced mobile revenue from Google search could result.    Fining Google for favoring its own products sets an unwelcome precedent for other tech firms. European Union authorities could forbid Amazon's listing of own-label products ahead of competitors' offerings.   The biggest danger comes in May when companies must comply with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. It requires that they seek explicit consent before using personal data. It's probable many customers will not agree, which means Google could find it harder to customize Gmail ads and Facebook might not be able to use WhatsApp information to sell ads on other sites and apps. Customers also have the right to delete their data or port it elsewhere -- reducing the ability of Amazon and Google to lock in cloud customers.   Parts of Europe's agenda may be adopted elsewhere. And lawmakers in the United States are mulling putting big internet firms under the oversight of the strict Federal Communications Commission, rather than the lax Federal Trade Commission.   Apple is the biggest tech giant, worth nearly $900 billion, yet it stands curiously apart. The company sells lots of expensive phones, but it's no monopolist. The iPhone's combined share of the five biggest European markets is under 20 percent, says Kantar Worldpanel. The company also uses privacy as a selling point. It does not gather personal information to sell to advertisers, places similar restrictions on app developers and fights government attempts to unlock suspects' phones. Apple's inability to master social media means its business does not affect elections either.   Apple is not carefree. The company's attempts to slither out of paying taxes make it a target in its own right. At worst, though, the result is probably a fine. Its rivals are looking at major, forced changes in their business models.   Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

Cracking Down on I.P. Theft,"Dennis C. Blair is a former director of national intelligence and a former commander in chief of the United States Pacific Command. Keith Alexander is a former commander of the United States Cyber Command and a former director of the National Security Agency. President Trump on Monday instructed the office of the United States Trade Representative to consider an investigation into China's sustained and widespread attacks on America's intellectual property. This investigation will provide the evidence for holding China accountable for a decades-long assault on the intellectual property of the United States and its allies. For too long, the United States has treated China as a developing nation to be coaxed and lectured, while tolerating its bad behavior as merely growing pains. There has been an expectation that as China's economy matures, it will of its own accord adopt international standards in commerce, including protection for intellectual property. There has also been a tendency to excuse mercantilist behavior, including industrial espionage, as a passing phase, and to justify inaction as necessary to secure Chinese cooperation on other, supposedly more important, issues.     Chinese companies, with the encouragement of official Chinese policy and often the active participation of government personnel, have been pillaging the intellectual property of American companies. All together, intellectual-property theft costs America up to $600 billion a year, the greatest transfer of wealth in history. China accounts for most of that loss.   Intellectual-property theft covers a wide spectrum: counterfeiting American fashion designs, pirating movies and video games, patent infringement and stealing proprietary technology and software. This assault saps economic growth, costs Americans jobs, weakens our military capability and undercuts a key American competitive advantage -- innovation.   Chinese companies have stolen trade secrets from virtually every sector of the American economy: automobiles, auto tires, aviation, chemicals, consumer electronics, electronic trading, industrial software, biotech and pharmaceuticals. Last year U.S. Steel accused Chinese hackers of stealing trade secrets related to the production of lightweight steel, then turning them over to Chinese steel makers.   Perhaps most concerning, China has targeted the American defense industrial base. Chinese spies have gone after private defense contractors and subcontractors, national laboratories, public research universities, think tanks and the American government itself. Chinese agents have gone after the United States' most significant weapons, such as the F-35 Lightning, the Aegis Combat System and the Patriot missile system; illegally exported unmanned underwater vehicles and thermal-imaging cameras; and stolen documents related to the B-52 bomber, the Delta IV rocket, the F-15 fighter and even the Space Shuttle.   President Trump's action on Monday acknowledges the broad scope of the challenge. Central to Chinese cybersecurity law is the ''secure and controllable'' standard, which, in the name of protecting software and data, forces companies operating in China to disclose critical intellectual property to the government and requires that they store data locally. Even before this Chinese legislation, some three-quarters of Chinese imported software was pirated. Now, despite the law, American companies may be even more vulnerable.   For decades, successive American administrations have concluded that some level of exposure to China's depredations against our intellectual property is simply the cost of doing business with the world's now second-largest economy. This is not acceptable. Although China is an important trading partner with the United States, it is imperative to establish a fair and level trading environment.   Driving down intellectual-property theft by China and other countries is vital for America's economic well-being and national security. We urge American companies, as well as our allies abroad, who share these interests, to work with the administration through this process.   There is intellectual-property protection on the books in China, and some American companies have been successful bringing cases in Chinese courts. The time may come when China applies the same efforts to protecting intellectual property that it now does to stealing it. However, for now, the United States and other developed countries must look to their own laws and actions to protect their companies from loss and ruin.   President Trump's action on Monday is a major step in the right direction. If the investigation proves extensive Chinese government support for intellectual-property theft, it could trigger retaliatory action by the American government, based on the Economic Espionage Act, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the National Defense Authorization Act.   The government should lead in this effort, but it can't go it alone. A broad, sustained campaign bringing together the government, the private sector and our allies is the only way to halt this hemorrhaging of America's economic life blood.

Equifax Is Facing Harsh Scrutiny. If Only It Had Come a Bit Sooner.,"Equifax warehouses the most intimate details of Americans' financial lives, from the credit cards in their wallets to the size of their medical bills. But the company doesn't face the constant monitoring and auditing that help strengthen banks' systems and data protections. Despite the wealth of sensitive information in its databases, Equifax, in essence, falls through the regulatory cracks.    The dangers of such lax oversight became apparent on Thursday when Equifax disclosed that hackers had compromised the personal and confidential information, including Social Security numbers, of nearly half of the American population.   Equifax is now scrambling to contain the legal and financial fallout.    New York's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has opened an investigation into the data breach, while two potential class-action suits have been filed. Shares of the company were down nearly 14 percent on Friday.   A consumer backlash is growing over the company's response to the breach. The remedy that Equifax has offered -- one year of free credit monitoring -- struck many as inadequate. Compounding the frustration, three senior executives, including the chief financial officer, sold $1.8 million worth of shares in the days after Equifax discovered the breach.   Equifax and two other consumer credit bureaus, Experian and TransUnion, create the reports used to calculate credit scores, the ubiquitous three-digit numbers that banks, insurers, lenders and employers rely on to make all manner of decisions. Those scores, the algorithmic assessment of a consumer's entire financial history, help decide whether somebody gets a job or a new home.   The bureaus each have files on roughly 200 million Americans. And consumers have little choice, since banks and other companies hand over financial information and other data directly to the bureaus. The industry has been marred by complaints of mistakes on credits reports and difficulties in fixing them.   The data breach at Equifax, which affected 143 million people, could compound the problems, leaving consumers vulnerable to identify theft. It was the third hacking disclosed by Equifax this year.   ''You cannot fire the three credit bureaus,'' said Rohit Chopra, a former assistant director at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and now a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America. ''Credit reporting agencies are the plumbing of our financial system but are much less regulated than many banks.''   TransUnion said it was investigating the nature of Equifax's attack and what, if any, actions might be appropriate. Experian and Equifax did not return calls for comment. Equifax released a statement apologizing to customers for ''the concern and frustration this causes.''   The credit bureaus fall into something of a regulatory gray area in Washington.   They are covered by many of the same data security laws that apply to banks. But banks face much stricter oversight, with a team of agencies working together to audit institutions and monitor their compliance. Non-bank companies, like the credit bureaus, generally are scrutinized only after something has gone wrong.   Federal laws require all companies to take reasonable steps to safeguard consumer data. While the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has some supervisory and enforcement authority over the credit bureaus, the agency generally leaves data privacy enforcement to the main regulator in charge of it, the Federal Trade Commission. And the trade commission lacks the authority to impose big fines.   Last month, the commission punished TaxSlayer, a tax preparation website, for a weak security system that allowed hackers to gain access to nearly 9,000 customer accounts. TaxSlayer agreed to strengthen its systems and undergo compliance audits. But it paid no financial penalty, because the commission has no power to levy fines for first-time violations of certain rules.   ''Both in terms of resources and authority, what the F.T.C. can do clearly doesn't measure up to the scale of the problem,'' said William McGeveran, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who specializes in privacy law.   A spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission, Juliana Gruenwald Henderson, said the agency does not comment on its investigations and declined to say if it had opened one on Equifax.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is ''looking into'' the data breach at Equifax, according to Sam Gilford, a spokesman, but he declined to comment further.   Credit reporting is big business. Equifax made $3.1 billion in revenue last year, collecting the vast majority from businesses like banks and other financial service companies.   But the industry has been the subject of criticism over its data collection and reports. In some examples, two people were combined into a single file. In other instances, the bureaus have inserted a person's information into the wrong credit report, which can occur when two people have similar Social Security numbers.   Two years ago, a coalition of more than 30 state attorneys general cracked down on the credit bureaus, negotiating a deal that required sweeping changes. The bureaus dropped some error-ridden data sources from their reports and agreed to provide more information to consumers who disputed data on the reports.   Problems have persisted. This year, Equifax and TransUnion agreed to pay a combined $23 million to settle allegations by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that they made ''false promises'' to lure customers into buying credit-related products. Those products were promoted as free, but came with monthly fees if customers didn't cancel during the trial period.   The data breach at Equifax could expose the company to legal and financial challenges, although the regulatory environment isn't likely to become stricter under the current presidential administration.   On Friday, Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, sent a letter to the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee calling for a hearing to address the breach. In his letter, Mr. Lieu asked that representatives of the three bureaus be called to testify about what steps were being taken to prevent future intrusions.   ''Congress has a strong role to play in preventing such attacks on our financial and I.T. infrastructure, and must hold those entrusted with our most sensitive data to account,'' Mr. Lieu wrote in the letter.   As consumers digested the scope of the hacking, a website set up by Equifax to help was inundated. The site purported to determine whether people's data was compromised, after visitors entered six digits of a Social Security number and other information.   It offered only vague responses, saying personal information was not impacted or that it ''may have been impacted.'' People who used the site quickly noticed that entering bogus names and numbers often generated the same messages.   ''It requires trust where there is no trust,'' said Justin Baxter, a consumer lawyer in Portland, Ore., who is an attorney in a suit seeking class-action status against Equifax. ''Asking people to type in personal information to find out if their personal information has been breached -- a lot of people are not going to do that.''   Equifax also recommended signing up for a monitoring services. But the program initially required users to give away their rights to legal action and agree to use arbitration to settle disputes.   It immediately drew outrage, with Mr. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, calling on Equifax to remove language that could deny victims the right to sue. Equifax has since changed the clause, giving consumers the ability to opt out.   The company is now offering one year of free credit monitoring to all consumers, not just victims of the breach. It is also providing people the ability to freeze their Equifax reports, which, in theory, should prevent thieves from applying for credit in their name.   ''This is a one-year solution for an eternal problem,'' said Adam Levin, chairman of CyberScout, which provides data breach defense services. ''The collateral damage can be devastating, and when you are talking about Social Security numbers the only expiration date a Social Security number has is yours.''     "
"3 Weeks Later, Equifax Makes a Peace Offering","For some time, the credit reporting industry has been quietly attempting to change the behavior of consumers who wish to protect their own data: They want you to ''lock'' your files, not ''freeze'' them. Freezing allows you to close down your credit file in a way that stops thieves in their tracks. When they try to open new credit in your name, the bank or cellphone company will find that it can't pull the credit report. This can cost the bureaus money. If you simply don't bother applying for instant credit at the department store or do not remember the numerical PIN they gave you to thaw your file, then the bureaus can't sell that access to your file. Freezes are also subject to state laws.     But locking -- which has the same effect as freezing -- faces no such rules and has no hard-to-remember PIN. When Equifax issued the mea culpa it owed us a few weeks ago via an op-ed column in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday night, Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., the interim chief executive, threw a padlock our way.   The company says its credit lock will be free for life and be ready by Jan. 31. It already offers a credit locking service, so perhaps we should take its word on the date.   This is the same company, however, that could not create a functioning website for people worried about whether thieves had stolen their Social Security numbers. People who have been trying to freeze their files have run into too many problems to name, and many of them do not yet have PINs. I've received hundreds of emails complaining about Equifax's basic dysfunction.   All we know about its locking service is what Mr. Barros said in his op-ed piece. Here are the questions we don't have answers to, drawn from 18 questions I sent to Equifax on Tuesday night about locks and freezes.   Why not make freezes free for life, too? Why not make them easier to use instead of inventing an entire separate mechanism? Given the mess you face with people's data security, why not create a three-bureau freeze or lock, so that people don't have to worry about thieves taking data stolen from Equifax and using it through competitors, Experian or TransUnion?   Other things we don't know yet: Whether Equifax will force people to submit to mandatory arbitration or some other loss of privileges or rights in exchange for free locks for life. Or whether your name will end up on lists for various offers of credit. This is how TransUnion's similar free service works, one that it's been pushing hard at people who have come to its website looking for a credit freeze in the wake of the Equifax hack.   Unlocking a file is instant. Over the years, and even on Experian's website as recently as this week, people in the industry and banking representatives have repeatedly warned that it can take days to unfreeze your file, which can cause big problems if you're trying to buy a car or close on a home.   That scares plenty of people off, but it is not true. Experian and TransUnion spokesmen both said this week that lifting a freeze by phone or online should take no more than 15 minutes as long as you have your PIN in hand. I've had my files frozen for a decade and have always found the thawing to be instantaneous.   Experian's lock is only available with a monthly credit monitoring service, which can cost $9.99 to $24.99 a month. This will always cost more than simply freezing your credit file, even if you thaw it frequently and live in states that have higher than average freeze costs.   I'm inclined to accept Equifax's apology, assuming the data breach doesn't turn out to be an inside job. But the company has shown no ability to handle the most basic of technological tasks under pressure these last few weeks. So I see no reason to believe that the rollout of this new iteration of its lock will work very well. I'm going to keep my freeze there until further notice and feel good about any additional dollars it cannot make off my name.     "
Farhad and Mike's Week in Tech: Twitter's Eventful Few Days,"Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad: Mike! How are you doing? I'm writing from Seattle, where I visited this week for an Amazon press event about Echo and Alexa. Here's the news: Amazon is making a lot of Echo devices. There are at least a half dozen different talking speakers now, including one that doubles as an alarm clock.    Soon I'll be talking to Alexa more than I talk to you! I can't wait.   Mike: Yeah, yeah. Alexa sounds nice, but did you visit the Seattle-area Starbucks stores? They're basically fancier than my actual house.    Farhad: I'm sure your house isn't that nice anyway. O.K., on to other tech news.   The Saga of the Equifax Hack   Farhad: Let's start with Equifax, the credit ratings agency that got epically hacked last month. After a bungling response to a breach that exposed the private information of up to 143 million Americans, the company's C.E.O. retired this week.   But as our colleague Ron Lieber has been pointing out, it's still unclear if the company has gotten any better at doing the basic task of responding to consumers about the hack, or putting in place protections for their data. I continue to be amazed at how poorly they're handling this -- and, more than that, how this doesn't scream out for a movement calling for data-protection regulations.   Mike: This is really important, by the way. It's not like our Twitter accounts getting hacked and someone tweeting a bunch of crazy stuff. It's social security numbers, credit reports, addresses, phone numbers -- deep access to our lives, there for the taking.   Here's the funniest part to me: As a kind of mea culpa, Equifax offered a free credit lock to customers for life. This is the company that couldn't get a functioning site together to give consumers information on what happened with the hack and whether their information was stolen. Now we're supposed to try and use their tools and services again?   Anyway, this one is not going to end anytime soon. My guess is that Congress is going to step in and amp up the pressure relatively soon.   Twitter's Eventful Week   Farhad: O.K., let's turn to social networks. Six years ago, when I worked at Slate, I did one of those contrarian pieces the magazine is famous for -- I called on Twitter to drop its fetishized 140-character limit. I argued that Twitter would have better conversations and fewer ugly abbreviations if it doubled the limit to 280 characters. And you know what happened? Everyone said I was stupid.   Mike: I bet this is an elaborate setup for you to say how right you were all along.   Farhad: Correct! So imagine my surprise when Twitter announced this week that it is testing out just such a plan! A select few will be getting the ability to tweet up to 280 characters; if the test proves successful (according to Twitter's own bar for success), the company could decide to roll it out for everyone. (Also, there is a hack to get 280-character tweets already. I tried it out, of course!)   Mike: Ugh, Farhad. Congrats on being right for the first time in your life.   Farhad: Of course people on Twitter are up in arms about this. Twitter users whine over the tiniest changes, so something big like this set off hours of ridiculousness.   But honestly I can't see a single good argument for not at least testing longer tweets. The original 140-character limit was a totally arbitrary number designed to satisfy a technical constraint around text messages. The constraint no longer applies, so why not test another number -- maybe a different arbitrary number will work better!   Mike: Twitter has long treated any major product changes as taboo, and according to folks I spoke to, the 140-character limit was ''sacrosanct'' to many people internally. Twitter needs to be willing to take risks on how they might change the product, and I'm glad they're trying this.   All that said, I hope they're not wedded to any major changes. My advice is to try all sorts of tweaks and changes, see what works, what doesn't, and keep the best of it all. Maybe 280 is too few characters! Maybe 140 is too many! Basically, my approach would be ''no more sacred cows.''   My last suggestion: Stop being so scared of what your power users say. Twitter employees spend their days seeing what people who are already addicted to Twitter want out of Twitter. Perhaps a better way to go about it would be to ignore the vocal minority and figure out what prevents normal, non-techie people from coming back to Twitter regularly?   Farhad: Good idea. But there was more serious stuff with Twitter, too. For the last few weeks Facebook has been dealing with fallout over its role in amplifying Russian propaganda during the presidential election. Now it's Twitter's turn.   According to a research report, Twitter has been as instrumental to propagandists, particularly through the use of fake accounts -- that is, accounts run by bots pretending to be actual users. (Oh by the way, this was another thing that I predicted! Yeah, I'm going to be that guy.)   Mike: You will always be that guy.   Twitter is in some hot water, and they finally came clean Thursday -- to a small extent, at least -- about the company's part in the 2016 election. My guess: Other tech companies are watching this and waiting for their turn in the spotlight. And it's going to be painful.   Uber's International Issues   Farhad: Finally, let's talk Uber. The car-sharing company had some scuffles with lawmakers in London and Canada this week. I thought the way they handled each was interesting, because it shed light on how the new C.E.O., Dara Khosrowshahi, is different from his predecessor. But how about you explain the details and school me?   Mike: In a nutshell: Transportation interests and the mayor of London said that Uber doesn't play by the rules and shouldn't be in London, and revoked Uber's license to operate there. There is an appeal period, and Uber is galvanizing support from those who want the ride-hailing service. But it was a big blow to Uber, by most measures.   Moreover, Uber decided to pull out of Quebec instead of face new, more restrictive legislation passed in the area, a fascinating move for a company usually willing to buck against any boundaries lawmakers deem fit to place upon it.   The largest difference here is how Dara handled the situation. He was widely praised for what many saw was humility and an admission that Uber's past and reputation had caught up with it, and that the company would be forced to pay the price of such a past for some time.   That is markedly different tone than, say, when Travis Kalanick, the former chief executive, was running the company. He was more of a wartime chief -- something many argue was necessary for the first years of Uber's life.   To Travis's credit, he has said he's made mistakes in the past and is trying to turn over a new leaf. But Dara's response is clearly positioning Uber as a changed company.   Anyway, I'm leaving now, before you link to another old article of yours and explain why you were right about something else. See ya!   Farhad: Bye!

Key Document Is Unsealed in Waymo Case,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car unit, has been fighting in the courts for months to gain access to a key document in a trade secrets case that it has waged against Uber. That document became public late Monday, adding to the intrigue of whether Uber may have known it was getting stolen information for its autonomous vehicles operation. The document that became public was a due diligence report that Uber commissioned last year before buying an autonomous truck start-up, Ottomotto, for $680 million.     The start-up was founded by Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer who had worked at Google's self-driving unit before it became Waymo. Mr. Levandowski left Google six months before Uber's acquisition of Ottomotto, and has been at the center of accusations that he stole information about Google's self-driving technology and used it at Uber.   The due diligence report, conducted by the cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg from March 2016 to August 2016, paints one of the clearest pictures of the timeline of events leading up to Uber's acquisition of Ottomotto and exactly how much Uber knew of Mr. Levandowski's attempts to retain and access information taken from Google.   The document's release is the latest salvo in the lawsuit between the two biggest players in the nascent self-driving car industry. Waymo filed suit against Uber in February, spurring a chain of events that ultimately resulted in the removal of Mr. Levandowski from his position at Uber. The suit, which has implications for which company may take the lead in the race around autonomous vehicles, is set to go to trial this month.   The Stroz report was kept sealed for months as Uber fought to keep it private. Waymo is using the report's inclusion into the record to show Uber was aware of Mr. Levandowski's actions. Waymo has asked for the court to postpone the trial, scheduled for Oct. 10, as it looks into the report and other recent disclosures from Uber.   But the report does not appear to clearly answer a main question in the case: Whether or not Uber used any of the designs or technology Mr. Levandowski took with him from Google in Uber's own self-driving car project.   What the report details instead is a history of Mr. Levandowski's meeting with Uber executives while he was still employed at Google but suggesting working together in some capacity. Mr. Levandowski eventually partnered with Lior Ron, a Google colleague, and pitched the idea for Ottomotto to a group of Google employees over barbecues and a ski trip to Lake Tahoe. The pair convinced roughly a dozen of the Googlers to join their effort, and the group eventually split off from Google to start Ottomotto.   After leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski said he found a data storage container in his house containing ''source code, design files, laser files, engineering documents, and software related to Google self-driving cars,'' according to the report, information that Mr. Levandowski said he downloaded as a matter of ''his departure from ordinary course of business.''   Investigators also found evidence of photos of Google self-driving car designs, whiteboard sketches and pictures of hardware and electronic components stored on Mr. Levandowski's iPhone.   ''The Stroz Report unequivocally shows that, before it acquired his company, Uber knew Anthony Levandowski had a massive trove of confidential Waymo source code, design files, technical plans and other materials after leaving Google; that he stole information deliberately, and repeatedly accessed it after leaving Waymo; and that he tried to destroy the evidence of what he had done,'' said Johnny Luu, Waymo spokesman.   Mr. Levandowski has invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination. He had previously asserted, after realizing what information he had from Google, that he took the data storage disks to a shredding facility to have them destroyed.   ''Even after 60 hours of inspection of our facilities, source code, documents and computers -- no Google material has been found at Uber,'' Matt Kallman, a spokesman for Uber, said in a statement.

Credit Agencies at Odds Over Free Locking,"When Equifax's recently retired chief executive, Richard F. Smith, appeared before a panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Tuesday, he held himself out as a changed man. After decades of maintaining high walls between the credit data that his company collects and the citizens like you and me who simply want to know what it says and means, he claimed that he and his former company now want to put us in control. We should have the ability to lock any new creditor out of our credit files, he said, and the forthcoming service that makes it possible will be free forever.    Then, he threw down a gauntlet of sorts. ''I would encourage TransUnion and Experian to do the same,'' he said, referring to Equifax's primary competitors. ''It's time we change the paradigm and give the power back to the consumer to control who accesses his or her credit.''   Experian's response came about six hours later: Go pound sand. ''We are looking at broader solutions that can help consumers effectively and securely operate in the credit economy, but it shouldn't be done based on crisis-mode responses from Equifax,'' Michael Troncale, an Experian spokesman, said in an emailed statement.    This intramural spat that broke out late Tuesday is centered on what the best remedies are in the wake of the Equifax breach and what they should cost, if anything. Earlier this year, thieves pried loose as many as 145.5 million Social Security numbers, dates of birth and other personal information. Equifax's biggest peace offering so far has been what it refers to as a credit lock.   Credit locks work the same way as credit freezes, which have existed for more than a decade: In either case, you tell Equifax, Experian and TransUnion to flip a switch, after which no new creditor can see your credit report. Because companies won't open an account without checking up on you first, this has the effect of blocking thieves who try to impersonate you using stolen information to take out new loans in your name.   Locks and freezes only work, however, if you block access to your files at all three bureaus, which you have to do separately; if you only close off access to your Equifax file, someone might use information from the Equifax breach or some other data theft to open a credit card in your name at a bank that only checks an Experian report.   Freezes came into widespread existence only because of pressure from consumer advocates and state legislators, who eventually passed so many laws that the credit bureaus gave in and offered freezes nationwide about a decade ago. More recently, they've added credit locks, which accomplish the same thing but are not subject to state regulation.   Locks can differ in other ways as well. Equifax has confused consumers by discussing two different lock processes in the past month. You can turn the first on and off from a browser; it made this available along with the TrustedID Premier package of credit monitoring it offered free to every American after it announced its breach.   Last week, it announced that beginning Jan. 31, 2018, it would introduce a second way to lock, via a stand-alone mobile app that will lock and unlock someone's credit file. The service, it said, will be free for life.   There is a convenience angle here, too. Credit freezes require the use of a PIN, which you must supply to temporarily lift or permanently cancel a freeze. If you lose it, you won't be able to unfreeze your credit file instantly.   Canceling credit locks is supposed to be instant, too, which is crucial if you want to apply spontaneously for a credit card at a store counter or if you forget to unlock your file before going car shopping. But even Equifax's communications team seems confused on how quickly the process works. Its own website says, incorrectly, that unlocking can take 24 to 48 hours. I pointed this out to the company several days ago, and it admitted its error. But it still hasn't fixed the website.   TransUnion has a locking product as well, which it includes as part of a service called TrueIdentity. It is free, but you must submit to offers of credit from third parties in order to use it, which helps TransUnion make money. It also comes with mandatory arbitration and class-action lawsuit waivers. ''The arbitration agreement helps us to provide TrueIdentity to consumers at no charge,'' said David Blumberg, a company spokesman, in a statement.   Before Mr. Smith's congressional testimony Tuesday, Experian had been charging money for its credit lock. To get the lock, you have to sign up for a monthly credit monitoring service, which can cost $9.99 to $24.99 a month. This will always cost more than what they charge to simply freeze your credit file and thawing it occasionally when you need to apply for credit.   When I asked Experian whether it would change its policy on this, it declined to commit to anything. ''We will continue to review this issue in light of the other alternatives available and engage with consumers and other stakeholders to ensure consumer-centric solutions are available that enable consumers to be safe in the credit economy,'' it said in its statement.   Like TransUnion, Experian forces people to sign away legal rights, which probably isn't the best way to help people feel safe. Experian said that this was ''consistent with the industry standard for consumer terms and conditions.'' Arbitration agreements represent ''a simple and convenient dispute resolution mechanism that helps ensure claims are resolved quickly and to the parties' satisfaction.'' For an alternative view, see my colleagues' series of articles about how these clauses actually work in practice.   Why might Experian be taking such a hard line?   There could be a cold political calculation at work. Sure, making its locks free might head off any federal legislation forcing free locks or freezes on the companies. But given the dysfunction in Washington, perhaps its lobbyists are telling executives that any new laws are unlikely.   Meanwhile, as John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecommunications and fraud at the National Consumers League, said to me in an interview, making freezes and locks cumbersome and expensive creates a competitive advantage for Experian. After all, if Experian has fewer blocked credit files than Equifax or TransUnion, it will be easier for Experian to ultimately sell access to more files than its competitors.   Which is not to say that Experian doesn't believe what Mr. Smith of Equifax is saying. It knows that people should shut down access to their credit file as a matter of basic financial hygiene. In a podcast on its website, where the host made the radically misleading statement that a credit freeze can take ''weeks or whatever it is,'' a guest, Michelle Felice-Steele, endorsed the locking concept heartily.   ''Basically people lock things that are valuable to them, and your credit is also valuable,'' said Ms. Felice-Steele, Experian's director of product management in its consumer services group. ''They value that information not getting into identity thieves' hands.''   So cutting off access to your credit report is an excellent idea, and Experian knows it, even if it might cause problems for the banks and others who keep it in business. Experian simply wants to stick us all with the bill for its freezes and locks. We'll see how long it continues to get away with it.     "
Mom's Maiden Name Is Not a Secret,"Anne Diebel is a senior investigator at the private investigations firm QRI. Resolutions to shake laziness, get organized and gain control of finances are ritually adopted each January and abandoned soon after. But there's one common bad habit that consumers and billion-dollar businesses alike should have quit long ago and can't afford to carry into 2018: the use of weak website security questions. Your mother's maiden name is not a secret. This should be obvious, yet this question and similarly flawed questions continue to be asked of us when we forget a password or log in from a new computer. Website security questions have been around since the dawn of the web but became ubiquitous after a 2005 recommendation by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council that banks improve their security measures for online banking. The council did not specify what these improvements should be, and so banks chose security questions, something they had been using offline for decades anyway -- the mother's maiden name convention dates to 1882. Other types of businesses, perhaps assuming that the banks knew what they were doing, followed suit.     Security questions are astonishingly insecure: The answers to many of them are easily researched or guessed, yet they can be the sole barrier to someone gaining access to your account. The cryptology and security expert Bruce Schneier once described them as an ''easier-to-guess low-security backup password that sites want you to have in case you forget your harder-to-remember higher-security password.''   Still, this technology has persisted despite the availability of two-factor authentication, and on sites that we use frequently and that contain important, sensitive data -- Facebook, Amazon, eBay, PayPal and many banks and airlines.   There has been no shortage of incidents demonstrating these questions' vulnerabilities. In 2005, Paris Hilton's T-Mobile account was hacked by a teenager who, like anyone who searched ''Paris Hilton Chihuahua'' on the internet, knew the answer to ''What's your favorite pet's name?'' In 2008, Sarah Palin's Yahoo account was hacked by a college student who reset her password using her birth date, ZIP code and the place where she met her spouse. In 2014, after nude photos of several Hollywood actresses were leaked, Apple reported that their iCloud accounts had been hacked through ''a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions.''   If you aren't famous enough to be a target, you may still be a victim of a mass data breach. Whereas passwords are usually stored in hashed or encrypted form, answers to security questions are often stored -- and therefore stolen -- in plain text, as users entered them. This was the case in the 2015 breach of the extramarital encounters site Ashley Madison, which affected 32 million users, and in some of the Yahoo breaches, disclosed over the past year and a half, which affected all of its three billion accounts.   The Equifax breach this year may have revealed some users' security questions and answers outright, and it certainly gave thieves enough personal information to answer common questions. TransUnion evidently did not heed this warning: Users wishing to freeze their credit files in the wake of the Equifax breach have to create an account, and to do so they must choose a security question, such as ''What city were you born in?''   According to Troy Hunt, a cybersecurity expert, organizations continue to use security questions because they are easy to set up technically, and easy for users. ''If you ask someone their favorite color, that's not a drama,'' Mr. Hunt said. ''They'll be able to give you a straight answer. If you say, 'Hey, please download this authenticator app and point the camera at a QR code on the screen,' you're starting to lose people.'' Some organizations have made a risk-based decision to retain this relatively weak security measure, often letting users opt for it over two-factor authentication, in the interest of getting people signed up.   Security questions ask for something you know about yourself, and to be even moderately secure, they should ask for something only you know. It's exceedingly difficult to design questions that do this. Many security questions ask for biographical information that is publicly available, whether in open records or via social media: where you were married, your first phone number, your paternal grandfather's middle name.   Aside from these questions' vulnerability to a little research (to say nothing of nosy parents or malicious exes), none of them are relevant to all adults. How many of us can answer the premillennial ''What city were you in to celebrate the year 2000?'' or ''What year did you take out your first mortgage?'' And how many Indian- or Brazilian-born users went to a high school without a mascot, or grew up on a street with no name? How many of our mothers never changed their names?   The other main type of security question asks for a subjective answer. Such questions imagine lives punctuated by distinct firsts and bests and filled with enduring favorites, but favorites and bests and even firsts can change when people maintain accounts for decades. At some point, both factual and subjective security questions become archaeological. ''In what month did you meet your significant other?'' requires a framing question: Whom were you with when you set up this account?   A 2015 study by Google engineers found that only 47 percent of people could remember what they put down as their favorite food a year earlier -- and that hackers were able to guess the food nearly 20 percent of the time, with Americans' most common answer being pizza. (Google has been phasing out security questions in recent years.) Even when people remember their answers, they sometimes forget their precise form. This hazard has prompted some websites to offer a fixed set of answers. To ''What is your favorite type of reading?'' United Airlines offers a pull-down menu with 19 options, including blogs, cookbooks, professional development and self-help, but nothing like literary fiction (the death of the novel?).   As long as security questions are going to be used, professional consensus holds, they should have many possible answers, and each of those possible answers should be simple, stable, memorable and not easily researched or guessed. But questions that are sufficiently general to apply to most people almost never fulfill these requirements: ''What is your favorite season?'' ''What is your favorite fabric?'' ''Who is your favorite person in history?''   Even exceptions that look good at first fall short. ''What is the last name of the teacher who gave you your first failing grade?'' includes an assumption about academic records; strangely, it appears on the LSAT registration website, whose users' transcripts are likely to be too unblemished to furnish an answer. ''What was the name of the boy/girl you had your second kiss with?'' is impossible in its Proustian hyperspecificity. Then there's the State Bank of India's vertiginous ''What is the website that you rarely visit?'' which reads like a Zen koan whose purpose is to make you reflect on the unknowability of the answer.   What would a truly powerful security question be? The ideal is a science-fiction scenario where your future self calls your past self, and your past self asks your future self to prove it's you. When given the chance to write their own questions, though, most people choose not an intimate secret but something more like ''1+1=?''   The temporary solution, Mr. Hunt says, is to create false answers and to keep them somewhere safe, whether in a password manager (which can generate and store a random string for each answer field) or even on a piece of paper. Security questions pit ''usability against security,'' said Mr. Schneier, the cryptology and security expert, and the former usually wins.   Security questions are premised on a paradox: Our experiences are at once universal and particular to us. Yet it seems we are all lazy in exactly the same way.

"Bosch, Cisco, BNY Mellon, Others Launch New Blockchain Consortium","NEW YORK --  Cisco Systems Inc, Bosch Ltd and several other companies, have set up a consortium to work on how blockchain can be used to secure and improve ""internet of things"" applications, as sectors beyond finance seek to benefit from bitcoin's underlying technology.  The group, which also includes Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Foxconn Technology Group, security company Gemalto and blockchain startups Consensus Systems (ConsenSys), BitSE and Chronicled Inc said on Friday that they will collaborate to develop a shared blockchain protocol for the internet of things - the concept that everyday objects, from washing machines to shipping containers, will be connected to the internet and will be able to send and receive data.    While having more devices connected to the internet presents some advantages for consumers and businesses, it also increases the scope of devices which could be hacked.    Blockchain is a tamper-proof distributed record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet and secured through advanced cryptography. Proponents of the nascent technology believe it could be used to provide additional security and better identity management features to internet of things applications.   ""We are seeing tremendous potential for the application of blockchain in industrial use cases,"" said Dirk Slama, chief alliance officer at Bosch Software Innovations. ""Being able to create a tamperproof history of how products are manufactured, moved and maintained in complex value networks with many stakeholders is a critical capability ...""    The consortium is one of several collaborative efforts by large companies aimed at advancing the development of blockchain technology. Around 40 banks are members of a blockchain consortium run by startup R3 CEV, while technology firms such as IBM Corp and Hitachi Ltd are part of a consortium led by the Linux Foundation.   Companies in different sectors are looking at the technology, but some financial firms have forged ahead, recently announcing plans to deploy new blockchain systems this year.    The new internet of things consortium highlights how companies could make bigger moves in blockchain this year.    ""Securing identity for physical property and packaging is going to be a big business opportunity over the next decade, high value parts of logistics supply chains and regulated industries like energy, pharmaceuticals, and cold chain could all see a blockchain component over the next decade,"" said Joe Pindar, director of product strategy at Gemalto.    As investment into blockchain continues to grow, skeptics have warned that the technology may be hyped and that it may take several years before companies can reap its benefits.

Joining the Windows Testing Team,"Q. I found a link to the Windows Insider program in my Windows 10 settings the other day. What is involved in participating? A. Windows Insider is Microsoft's free preview program for its users to try out new works-in-progress versions of the operating system. This type of prerelease software is also known as a beta version and it usually still has bugs to be worked out before the final release to the public. Apple has a similar venture for volunteers called the Apple Beta Software Program.     If your PC meets the system requirements and you join to become a member of the Windows Insider team, Microsoft allows you to download each new build of the next Windows version to learn, test and share your feedback. Microsoft is currently developing the new Creators Update of Windows 10, to be released this spring.   Proceed at your own risk. On the sign-up page, Microsoft warns that you will be working with experimental software and that, ''You might experience crashes, security vulnerabilities, data loss or damage to your device.'' You need to share information about your use of the software with the company and you can pick a ''ring,'' or frequency of updates.   If you have only one computer with specific programs you rely on to get things done, you may want to skip the Insider program and wait for the final version of the software to be publicly released. If you have a secondary PC (or a separate hard-drive partition) that is not vital to your computing needs -- and you do not mind working with potentially unstable code -- the program gives you a jump-start on new versions of the operating system.   You can sign up using the Windows Insider option within the current Windows 10 Settings app -- in Settings, go to Updates and Security, then Windows Update and select Advanced Options.

Screening Out Malware with Microsoft Edge,"Q. Google Chrome has malware warnings. Does Microsoft's Windows 10 browser have similar protections? A. Microsoft Edge, the browser created for its Windows 10 operating system, has a tool called the Windows Defender SmartScreen designed to thwart malicious websites, apps, downloads and other files that target PCs. The SmartScreen is optional, and you can set the level of protection you wish to have in the Windows Defender Security Center -- like outright blocking potentially intrusive software, or opting for a warning that a site may possibly have malicious intentions.     To get there in the latest version of Windows 10 (the Creators Update), go to the Start menu and open the Settings icon; you can also press the Windows and I keys on the keyboard to get there without the mouse. At the bottom of the Settings window, select Update & Security. On the next screen, choose Windows Defender and then Open Windows Defender Security Center.   In the Windows Defender Security Center window, select App & Browser Control. In the SmartScreen for Microsoft Edge section, make your selection: Block, Warn or Off. (The warning is typically the default setting.)   In addition to configuring protections for the Edge browser, you can also set up screening filters for apps and files downloaded from the web with Edge, or for apps downloaded through the online Windows Store. (Website screening involves checking the URL of a page you are visiting against a list of known malicious sites, so a link to Microsoft's privacy policy is also displayed under each setting.)   Earlier versions of Windows have a similar SmartScreen filter for the Internet Explorer browser that warns against potentially malicious sites and files. To see its settings in Internet Explorer, go to the Tools menu and select Safety.

Google Docs Glitch That Locked Out Users Underscores Privacy Concerns,"Google Docs threw some users for a loop on Tuesday when the service suddenly locked them out of their documents for violating Google's terms of service. The weird part? The documents were innocuous. The alerts were caused by a glitch, but they served as a stark reminder that not much is truly private in the cloud. ''This shows that Google is using advanced machine learning and other A.I. technologies to examine vast amounts of information in near real time,'' Dana Gardner, a leading cloud expert and a principal analyst at Interarbor Solutions, said on Tuesday.     Google Docs is a cloud-based collaborative tool that enables users to create documents and share them with others, and allows several people to edit and comment on a document at the same time.   Depending on whether those affected had created the document or whether it was shared with them, they were stopped from gaining access to the file or from sharing it.   Some received an alert: ''This item has been flagged as inappropriate and can no longer be shared.'' Others saw: ''You cannot access this item because it is in violation of our terms of service.''   Some of these people sought answers, and notified others, on Twitter.   ''Obviously this is raising questions in a lot of people's minds about the level of surveillance in internet tools, like cloud-based tools,'' Rachael Bale, whose tweets gained traction, said on Tuesday.   Ms. Bale, a reporter for National Geographic's Wildlife Watch, said that while what happened was ''problematic,'' she was not too taken aback. ''We know Google has access to all kinds of information about us,'' she said, adding that professionally, she avoids using Google Docs for ''anything sensitive.''   A Google spokesman said in a statement that a ''code push'' caused a small percentage of Google Docs to be incorrectly flagged as abusive, which caused them to be automatically blocked.   ''A fix is in place and all users should have full access to their docs,'' the statement said. ''Protecting users from viruses, malware and other abusive content is central to user safety. We apologize for the disruption and will put processes in place to prevent this from happening again.''   Mr. Gardner said the complexity of the technology and its widespread use carried considerable risks. ''A small tweak to the rules on what to flag or not can produce false positives like we saw today,'' he said.   ''It's clear that Google wants to be able to exert conditions on what content can be shared,'' he added. ''It needs to automate that via machines due to scale. And it shows that mistakes in what to reject can be made, with highly impactful consequences.''   Google's automated systems periodically scan certain file types in Google Drive that are shared with other users to detect abuse and protect users, a Google spokesman said on Tuesday. Some examples include antivirus scanning, malware and phishing detection. Google Docs is part of the Google Drive suite.   Leighton Pritchard, a computational biologist who also tweeted about the error he experienced, said that even though what happened on Tuesday was a glitch, it did shed light on how many users do not take the time to read terms of service agreements.   ''The default state is we ignore them,'' he said. ''We click yes because we want to use the thing that's useful to us. Lots of things can slip by us that way.''   ''I asked them directly if this was a result of an automated sweep for content,'' Mr. Pritchard said of Google. ''They said they couldn't say at the moment and would update us on the Google Groups page.''   One user on the Google Groups page, a help forum for those affected, said: ''I hope Google realises the seriousness of this issue. If they want this thing to function as a professional tool that people can trust, and not a toy, this has to stop right now.''   Someone else posted a message from the Google Docs support team that read: ''It appears our automated scan flagged your Google Form as potentially suspicious due to the types of information it requests from others. Generally, using a Google Form to collect confidential information -- such as IDs, passwords, bank account numbers, and passport numbers -- violates our Terms of Service.''   The user said the message made no sense. ''We did none of these things.''   While Google's privacy policy does not explicitly say that it scans files in Google Docs, it does say that it collects information from ''Gmail messages, G+ profile, photos, videos, browsing history, map searches, docs, or other Google-hosted content.''   ''Our automated systems analyze this information as it is sent and received and when it is stored,'' the policy states.   Mr. Gardner emphasized the importance of being mindful that your cloud activities are most likely being assessed, and that the process is far from perfected.   ''We should all be keenly aware that any and all content we create, handle or amend inside of these cloud services is being evaluated and scrubbed, and it's not being done by people, it's by machines,'' he said. ''And neither the machines nor their programmers are infallible. What's more, this is still an immature set of technologies, so teething pain is to be expected.''     "
Worried About Hacking? One Word: Update,"WikiLeaks this week published a trove of documents that appears to detail how the Central Intelligence Agency successfully hacked a wide variety of tech products, including iPhones, Android devices, Wi-Fi routers and Samsung televisions. That's just about every major category of consumer electronics. So what does that mean for you if you own one -- or several -- of these gadgets?    For many people, it may mean nothing at all. The thousands of pages of documents refer to programs that attacked outdated versions of the software systems running on devices, and many security vulnerabilities have since been patched.   On the other hand, many people may still use outdated software on their devices. And although the C.I.A. designed these tools to spy on terrorists in the interest of national security, the hacking tools may have ended up in the hands of a whole range of entities.    The fallout may also end up being broader. WikiLeaks, which released documents covering 2013 to 2016, has said its initial publication was just the first installment in a bigger cache of secret C.I.A. material.   So even if you aren't worried about what WikiLeaks revealed about the C.I.A. right now for yourself, here are some tips for protecting your cellphones, televisions and internet routers.   What you can do if you're on Android   Hundreds of millions of Android users still use devices based on older versions of the Google-made mobile operating system. The WikiLeaks document collection, which includes 7,818 web pages and 943 attachments, showed that the Android devices targeted by the hacking programs were mostly running a version of Android 4.0.   Today, about 30 percent of Android users, or at least 420 million people, are on a variant of Android 4.0, according to Google. The company said it was investigating reports of the security issues described in the WikiLeaks documents.   With the limited information we have now, the best thing people can do is to stop procrastinating on updating their software.   ''The one thing that people can and should be doing is keeping their apps and phones as up-to-date as possible,'' said Kurt Opsahl, deputy executive director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit.   For owners of older devices, getting the latest software updates may not be easy. Many older Android handsets, like the Samsung Galaxy S3, are unable to download the latest version of the Android software. If you are in that boat, it's a good time to purchase a new smartphone -- such as the Google Pixel -- which is running the latest Android software.   Other than ensuring that you have the latest operating system, Google recommends that Android users protect their devices with lock screens and PIN codes, and to enable a setting called Verify Apps, which scans apps downloaded from outside of Google's app store for malware.   What you can do on an iPhone   Many iPhone owners are far more up-to-date with their mobile software than Android device owners. So only a minority of iPhone users have devices with the versions of the Apple iOS operating system that the WikiLeaks documents mention.   Specifically, the WikiLeaks documents referred to exploits working on versions of iOS up to 8.2. About 79 percent of Apple users are running iOS 10, the latest version of the system, and only 5 percent are running a version older than iOS 9, according to Apple.   In raw numbers, with more than one billion iOS devices sold worldwide, that amounts to at least 50 million people running the outdated software.   For those worried about their iPhone security, the advice is generally the same here as for Android owners: iPhone and iPad users should make sure to be running the latest operating system, iOS 10. Apple said on Tuesday that many of the security issues described in the WikiLeaks documents had already been patched in the latest version of its software and that it was working to address remaining vulnerabilities.   Not all Apple devices can get the latest operating system. Apple's iOS 10 is compatible with iPhones as far back as the iPhone 5 released in 2012, and with iPads as old as the iPad Air and iPad Mini 2 released in 2013. If you are using anything older than those, it's a good time to buy a new device for the stronger security.   What you can do with your Samsung TV   With Samsung televisions, the situation is less clear. The documents mentioned programs attacking smart TVs in Samsung's F8000 series, which include microphones for voice controls. Samsung said it was looking into the WikiLeaks reports, and noted that software updates with the latest security enhancements are automatically downloaded on its televisions. The company did not immediately comment on whether any vulnerabilities had been patched.   The documents published by WikiLeaks disclosed that a tool called Weeping Angel puts the target TV in a ''fake off'' mode. Then, with the owner believing the TV is turned off, the set secretly records conversations in the room and sends them over the internet to a C.I.A. server computer.   Smart TVs are part of a proliferating category of ''internet of things'' devices that have raised security concerns because many of the companies that make them do not have strong backgrounds in information security. In a recent column I wrote about defending a smart home from cyberattacks, experts recommended strengthening Wi-Fi settings and regularly auditing smart home devices for software updates, among other tips.   That advice might not be sufficient for addressing privacy concerns around Samsung's smart TVs, because the Weeping Angel hack continues to control the television even when it appears to be turned off.   Craig Spiezle, executive director of the Online Trust Alliance, a nonprofit privacy group, said the WikiLeaks revelations could spur action that he sees as lacking from makers of connected devices.   ''I see this as a wake-up call for the industry to build better security and for consumers of these devices to rethink what they have and, in some cases, disconnect their connectivity,'' Mr. Spiezle said.   What to do with your router   The WikiLeaks documents also described methods of injecting malware into routers offered by Asian manufacturers like Huawei, ZTE and Mercury.   In general, it is wise for everyone to regularly check routers for so-called firmware updates to make sure they get the latest security enhancements.   Depending on which router you own, downloading the latest firmware update isn't very intuitive because it usually requires logging into the router. More modern routers like Eero and Google Wifi include mobile apps that help you download the latest updates automatically, so consider one of those if you are worried.   What to do with your computer   The WikiLeaks documents mentioned attacks on Linux, Windows and Apple computers. Personal computers have always been the most vulnerable devices we own, so this tip is fairly obvious: Make sure to install the latest operating system updates and use antivirus software. And as always, stay on guard for suspicious websites that may be serving malware.   Email: brian.chen@nytimes.com;   Twitter: @bxchen.     "
House Vote Sets Up Repeal of Internet Privacy Rules,"WASHINGTON -- Congress completed its overturning of the nation's strongest internet privacy protections for individuals on Tuesday in a victory for telecommunications companies, which can track and sell a customer's online information with greater ease. In a 215-to-205 vote largely along party lines, House Republicans moved to dismantle rules created by the Federal Communications Commission in October. Those rules, which had been slated to go into effect later this year, had required broadband providers to receive permission before collecting data on a user's online activities.     The action, which follows a similar vote in the Senate last week, will next be brought to President Trump, who is expected to sign the bill into law. A swift repeal may be a prelude to further deregulation of the telecommunications industry.   Republicans said President Barack Obama's appointee to the F.C.C., Tom Wheeler, had created a slew of overbearing rules for broadband providers that would put them at a disadvantage relative to internet companies like Google and Netflix. Those internet companies are not regulated by the F.C.C. but are increasingly in competition with telecom companies for online streaming customers.   Lawmakers and Republican regulators at the F.C.C. have said they plan to target the 2015 classification of broadband as a utilitylike service that is strapped with strong regulatory oversight. They are also set to seek the overturning of Obama-era net neutrality rules that forbade broadband providers from blocking, slowing down or charging extra for downloads of websites and apps.   ''What we've created is confusion, and this is the way to rein in an agency that was overreaching,'' said Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, who introduced the House bill to overturn the privacy rules. She used the Congressional Review Act in a procedure that lets lawmakers scrap regulations recently created by government agencies.   Ms. Blackburn said the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces privacy policies created by web companies such as Facebook and Google, was the best agency to oversee broadband privacy.   The White House issued a statement just before the House vote expressing support for the overhaul of privacy rules.   ''The rule departs from the technology-neutral framework for online privacy administered by the Federal Trade Commission,'' the Trump administration said. ''This results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor.''   Broadband companies immediately celebrated the House vote. They promised they would honor their voluntary privacy policies, noting that violations would be subject to lawsuits.   ''Today's vote removing another set of unnecessary regulations is a win-win for consumers and their privacy,'' said Jonathan Spalter, the chief executive of the broadband lobbying group USTelecom. ''Online users will continue to have the consistent and strong privacy protections they require and the promise of continued innovation they expect from the internet.''   Democratic lawmakers and regulators protested the vote, saying consumers had few options for high-speed internet service, which meant more government oversight of the companies was needed. Broadband providers have an expansive view into consumers' online habits, including seeing what sites and apps are visited, which can expose sensitive information.   The F.C.C. rules would have given consumers greater power to stop companies from making money off such information, the Democrats said.   ''The rules gave individuals control over their information when it comes to privacy,'' Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democratic F.C.C. commissioner, said in an interview. ''The proprietary information these companies have at their disposal should not only be treated with care, but consumers should have a voice.''   Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang.     "
The G.O.P. Just Sold Your Privacy,"Tom Wheeler was the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission from 2013 to 2017. On Tuesday afternoon, while most people were focused on the latest news from the House Intelligence Committee, the House quietly voted to undo rules that keep internet service providers -- the companies like Comcast, Verizon and Charter that you pay for online access -- from selling your personal information. The Senate already approved the bill, on a party-line vote, last week, which means that in the coming days President Trump will be able to sign legislation that will strike a significant blow against online privacy protection.     The bill not only gives cable companies and wireless providers free rein to do what they like with your browsing history, shopping habits, your location and other information gleaned from your online activity, but it would also prevent the Federal Communications Commission from ever again establishing similar consumer privacy protections.   The bill is an effort by the F.C.C.'s new Republican majority and congressional Republicans to overturn a simple but vitally important concept -- namely that the information that goes over a network belongs to you as the consumer, not to the network hired to carry it. It's an old idea: For decades, in both Republican and Democratic administrations, federal rules have protected the privacy of the information in a telephone call. In 2016, the F.C.C., which I led as chairman under President Barack Obama, extended those same protections to the internet.   To my Democratic colleagues and me, the digital tracks that a consumer leaves when using a network are the property of that consumer. They contain private information about personal preferences, health problems and financial matters. Our Republican colleagues on the commission argued the data should be available for the network to sell. The commission vote was 3-2 in favor of consumers.   Reversing those protections is a dream for cable and telephone companies, which want to capitalize on the value of such personal information. I understand that network executives want to produce the highest return for shareholders by selling consumers' information. The problem is they are selling something that doesn't belong to them.   Here's one perverse result of this action. When you make a voice call on your smartphone, the information is protected: Your phone company can't sell the fact that you are calling car dealerships to others who want to sell you a car. But if the same device and the same network are used to contact car dealers through the internet, that information -- the same information, in fact -- can be captured and sold by the network. To add insult to injury, you pay the network a monthly fee for the privilege of having your information sold to the highest bidder.   This bill isn't the only gift to the industry. The Trump F.C.C. recently voted to stay requirements that internet service providers must take ''reasonable measures'' to protect confidential information they hold on their customers, such as Social Security numbers and credit card information. This is not a hypothetical risk -- in 2015 AT&T was fined $25 million for shoddy practices that allowed employees to steal and sell the private information of 280,000 customers.   Among the many calamities engendered by the circus atmosphere of this White House is the diversion of public attention away from many other activities undertaken by the Republican-controlled government. Nobody seemed to notice when the Trump F.C.C. dropped the requirement about networks protecting information because we were all riveted by the Russian hacking of the election and the attempted repeal of Obamacare.   There's a lot of hypocrisy at play here: The man who has raged endlessly at the alleged surveillance of the communications of his aides (and potentially himself) will most likely soon gladly sign a bill that allows unrestrained sale of the personal information of any American using the internet.   Apparently, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress value privacy for themselves over the privacy of the Americans who put them in office. What is good business for powerful cable and phone companies is just tough luck for the rest of us.

When the Government Is Watching You,"To the Editor: ''Amid Investigation, a Primer on Surveillance Practices and Privacy'' (news article, March 25) provides a helpful overview of the current debate about government surveillance. There is genuine concern about the incidental collection of information on Americans. And that issue should be examined before a key provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that enables large-scale monitoring of international communications -- Section 702 -- is considered for renewal later this year.     But there should be no confusion about the original purpose of the law. FISA established legal authority for surveillance of ''agents of foreign powers'' suspected of terrorism or espionage. And when the law was passed in 1978, there was little doubt that the focus was the Soviet Union.   The reduced privacy safeguards in FISA, as compared with wiretapping in traditional criminal investigations, reflect a national security interest that arises when foreign adversaries pose a threat to the United States.   There is still much that is not known about the use of FISA in the investigation of Russian interference with the 2016 election. The Electronic Privacy Information Center is pursuing the disclosure of this information. But it is likely too soon to rule out the possibility that some of the information collected on Americans was not merely ''incidental.'' Data collection is not incidental if an individual is the target of an investigation authorized by law.   MARC ROTENBERG, WASHINGTON   The writer is president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.     "
Federal Court Revives High-Profile Challenge to N.S.A.'s Internet Surveillance,"A federal appeals court on Tuesday revived a high-profile challenge to the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance of internet communications as they enter or exit the United States. The ruling, by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, is significant because it increases the chances that the Supreme Court may someday scrutinize whether the N.S.A.'s so-called upstream system for internet surveillance complies with Fourth Amendment privacy rights. It is currently an open question about how to apply old legal concepts to 21st-century communications technology.    Handed down in Richmond, Va., the ruling reversed a Federal District Court judge's decision to throw out the case. The district judge had ruled that the plaintiffs -- including the Wikimedia Foundation, which publishes the Wikipedia online encyclopedia -- lacked standing to sue because they could not prove that their messages had been intercepted, and therefore did not reach the legal merits of the lawsuit.    But the three-judge appeals panel ruled unanimously that Wikimedia engages in so many internet communications with people around the world that it was essentially certain some of those messages had been caught up in the N.S.A.'s system.   ''To put it simply, Wikimedia has plausibly alleged that its communications travel all of the roads that a communication can take, and that the N.S.A. seizes all of the communications along at least one of those roads,'' Judge Albert Diaz wrote. ''Thus, at least at this stage of the litigation, Wikimedia has standing to sue for a violation of the Fourth Amendment.''   Because of how the internet works, surveillance of communications crossing network switches is different from traditional circuit-based phone wiretapping. While the government can target a specific phone call without touching anyone else's communications, it cannot simply intercept a surveillance target's email as it crosses the internet.   Instead, as information that came to light after the 2013 leaks of Edward J. Snowden made clearer, to find such emails it is necessary first to systematically copy data packets crossing a network switch and sift them in search of components from any messages involving a target. The N.S.A. stores a copy of the messages it was hunting for, while the packets from unrelated messages are discarded.   Documents provided by Mr. Snowden and declassified by the government have shown that this system works through equipment installed at the facilities of companies, like AT&T, that operate network links connecting the American internet to the rest of the world.   Privacy advocates contend that the initial copying and searching of all those data packets -- even if most are swiftly discarded -- violates Fourth Amendment protections against government search and seizure. Advocates have sought to have a judge address that question. But it has proved difficult to persuade judges that any particular plaintiff has legal standing to bring such a case.   ''This is an important victory for the rule of law,'' Patrick Toomey of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Wikimedia, said of Tuesday's ruling. ''The N.S.A. has secretly spied on Americans' internet communications for years, but now this surveillance will finally face badly needed scrutiny in our public courts.''   Mark Abueg, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment on whether the department would appeal the ruling.   The federal court ruling to dismiss claims by plaintiffs other than Wikimedia was upheld by two judges on the appeals panel. Although those plaintiffs communicated less voluminously than Wikimedia, they had argued that their communications were surely captured, too, because the system acts like a dragnet.   Their claim was based in part on a 2013 article in The New York Times describing the system, but two of the judges said that was insufficient to give them standing. A third judge, Andre M. Davis, dissented, saying they should have had their claim revived, too.   The revival of the Wikimedia case comes at an important time. The government carries out upstream surveillance under the FISA Amendments Act, which is set to expire at the end of 2017 unless Congress extends it.   The ruling is part of a growing constellation since the 2013 leaks by Mr. Snowden in which judges have taken a more skeptical stance when the government has argued that lawsuits over surveillance should be thrown out.   In another case, led by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a judge in California last week ordered the government to provide limited ''discovery'' about whether the plaintiffs' communications had been subjected to upstream surveillance. That case is focused on whether the system violates statutory limits on surveillance, like the Wiretap Act, rather than the Fourth Amendment.   And in yet another case, last October, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that a plaintiff had legal standing to challenge another aspect of surveillance under the FISA Amendments Act. That case involved the so-called Prism or downstream system, which collects emails of foreign targets who use American webmail providers like Gmail.

Wells Fargo Accidentally Releases Trove of Confidential Data,"When a lawyer for Gary Sinderbrand, a former Wells Fargo employee, subpoenaed the bank as part of a defamation lawsuit against a bank employee, he and Mr. Sinderbrand expected to receive a selection of emails and documents related to the case. But what landed in Mr. Sinderbrand's hands on July 8 went far beyond what his lawyer had asked for: Wells Fargo had turned over -- by accident, according to the bank's lawyer -- a vast trove of confidential information about tens of thousands of the bank's wealthiest clients.    The 1.4 gigabytes of files that Wells Fargo's lawyer sent included copious spreadsheets with customers' names and Social Security numbers, paired with financial details like the size of their investment portfolios and the fees the bank charged them. Most are customers of Wells Fargo Advisors, the arm of the bank that caters to high-net-worth investors.   By Mr. Sinderbrand's estimate, he has financial information for at least 50,000 individual customers. In all, Mr. Sinderbrand said, these clients have tens of billions of dollars invested through Wells Fargo, all laid out in vivid detail for him as part of the discovery process in his lawsuit.    The files were handed over to Mr. Sinderbrand with no protective orders and no written confidentiality agreement in place between his lawyers and Wells Fargo's. While the documents were not filed in court, it would be perfectly legal for Mr. Sinderbrand and his lawyer to release most of the material or include it in their legal filings, which would then become part of the public record.   The documents were sent by Angela A. Turiano, a lawyer with Bressler, Amery & Ross, an outside law firm in Florham Park, N.J., hired by Wells Fargo, which is not a party to the suit. Mr. Sinderbrand and one of his lawyers, Aaron Zeisler, notified Ms. Turiano on Thursday morning about the sensitive documents now in their hands.   In an email response, Ms. Turiano described the disclosure as ''inadvertent,'' and wrote, ''Obviously this was done in error and we would request that you return the CD asap so that it can be properly redacted.''   Mr. Zeisler said his client intended to keep the CD secure and confidential. ''We are continuing to evaluate his legal rights and responsibilities,'' Mr. Zeisler said. ''Wells Fargo has not identified what specific documents it asserts were inadvertently exposed.''   The disclosure is a data breach that potentially violates a bevy of state and federal consumer data privacy laws that limit the release of personally identifiable customer information to outside parties.   State and federal regulations also require companies to notify customers when their information has been improperly released, as Wells Fargo may now do. And some of the accounts in Mr. Sinderbrand's database are listed as having a foreign owner, which would potentially trigger a separate set of overseas regulations, such as Europe's stricter privacy statutes.   ''There are thousands of documents in here that the public should never see,'' Mr. Sinderbrand said, noting that a less scrupulous recipient of such data could have easily posted it online.   Reached on Friday, a day after Ms. Turiano was made aware of the issue, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo Advisors, Emily Acquisto, released the following statement: ''Wells Fargo takes the security and privacy of our customers' information seriously. We are investigating this matter and will take the proper steps based on the outcome of our investigation.''   Ms. Turiano and a spokeswoman for her firm did not respond to requests for comment.   The New York Times was shown large portions of the data and confirmed that it included what appeared to be clients' names, unredacted Taxpayer Identification Numbers, assets under management, portfolio performance, mortgage information and details on 529 education savings plans.   One file, for example, contained details on the holdings of a well-known hedge fund billionaire who had at least $23 million invested through Wells Fargo Advisors.   The files also include extensive information on Wells Fargo's financial advisers employed by the bank, their performance, their compensation and their client lists. One typical record showed the full roster of one adviser's client book and his commissions for the past year, totaling $1.5 million.   Based on the fairly narrow subpoena that his lawyer submitted -- it sought communications about Mr. Sinderbrand's employment and compensation -- there was no reason for the bank to turn over such information, especially without any redactions, Mr. Sinderbrand said.   ''This is a public policy issue,'' he said. ''They have to find out what happened and how it happened. Did it happen before, and could it happen again?''   Mr. Sinderbrand, 61, has an acrimonious history with Wells Fargo. He worked at the bank as a financial adviser until 2013, when he said he resigned to work for a health technology start-up. In 2016, he reached a settlement with the bank to resolve lingering financial issues related to his compensation. He later sued the bank, saying it violated a confidentiality clause in that agreement. That case is pending in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.   The documents that Wells Fargo gave to Mr. Sinderbrand's lawyer were sent in response to a subpoena in a separate defamation lawsuit proceeding in New Jersey against one of his brothers, who works at the bank.   The disclosure of so much sensitive material comes amid heightened concern about the ease with which personal information can be hacked, leaked or accidentally divulged. Banks are supposed to have extensive internal controls to protect clients' data.   Wells Fargo's internal controls are under particular scrutiny after a false-accounts scandal came to light last year. The company disclosed that its employees, trying to meet aggressive sales goals, opened as many as 3.5 million unwanted bank and credit card accounts for customers without their knowledge, and agreed this month to pay $142 million to settle a related class-action suit.   In terms of information security, litigation poses a special risk because confidential material often must change hands. The legal industry's best practices for handling digital documents in discovery -- ''e-discovery,'' as lawyers call it -- include careful reviews to exclude or redact personally identifiable information, encryption and other safeguards as data is transferred.   Confidential information is also often covered by a protective order, which must be granted by a judge, to prevent the data's recipients from sharing it more widely. None of that seemed to have happened here, reflecting a breakdown in vetting at multiple levels.   In Ms. Turiano's email to Mr. Sinderbrand's lawyer, she wrote: ''We went through a long process of a very large email review with an outside vendor with instructions on exclusion which was spot checked. Clearly there was some type of vendor error -- which I am confirming now.''     "
Uber Agrees to Privacy Audits in Settlement With F.T.C.,"WASHINGTON -- Uber has agreed to two decades of privacy and security audits to settle federal accusations that it did not keep promises to protect customer data. The Federal Trade Commission announced the settlement with Uber, a ride-sharing company, on Tuesday, ending an investigation that began in 2014 when the company promised to strengthen its privacy and security. The promises were made after a public outcry over reports that Uber employees were peering into the travel logs of customers.     The company will not face financial penalties from the deal, its second settlement with the commission this year. In January, Uber agreed to pay the commission $20 million over accusations that it deceived drivers by exaggerating potential earnings. The company has also been under investigation by the Department of Justice on suspicion of using a tool to evade law enforcement.   ''This case shows that, even if you're a fast growing company, you can't leave consumers behind: you must honor your privacy and security promises,'' said Maureen K. Ohlhausen, the acting chairwoman of the F.T.C.   The federal scrutiny has added to the pressures on Uber, a company that has undergone several public business crises in recent months, including the ouster of its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, an employee exodus and lawsuits from a competitor and an investor.   In the privacy case, the F.T.C. accused Uber of two violations. The first stemmed from the company's announcement in 2014 that it had developed an automated system to monitor employee access to consumer personal information.   The extra privacy measures were announced in response to news reports that some Uber employees were using a tool known as ''God View'' to track trips taken by users. On its website and in a statement, Uber announced that it had ''a strict policy prohibiting all employees at every level from accessing a rider or driver's data.'' It said, ''The only exception to this policy is for a limited set of legitimate business purposes.''   But the commission said it found that the company did not live up to that promise. In its complaint, the commission said that Uber stopped using its automated system of monitoring employee access to information less than a year after it was announced and that when it was in place, the company rarely monitored it.   ''The system was not designed or staffed to effectively handle ongoing review of access to data,'' the commission said.   The F.T.C. also said that Uber had not done enough to protect consumer data stored with a third-party cloud vendor, Amazon Web Services. Uber's lax practices led an intruder to access the personal information, including names, drivers licenses and some banking and social security numbers of 100,000 Uber drivers.   Uber said it strengthened its privacy and security measures in recent years.   ''We've significantly strengthened our privacy and data security practices since then and will continue to invest heavily in these programs,'' the company said in a statement.     "
In Quest of Privacy in the Digital Age,"To the Editor: Re ''How Privacy as We Knew It Died'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 6):    Andrew Burt and Dan Geer's thought-provoking article draws a critical conclusion that is based more in frustration than in fact: that ''excepting those who opt out of the digital world altogether, controls on data gathering is a lost cause.'' The only reason digital consumers cannot ''opt out'' of data collection is that the law does not give them that option.    From internet service providers collecting user browser history to educational software providers collecting broad data about our children, simple laws and regulations guaranteeing consumers the right to opt out of personal data collection -- or better yet, to opt in to it -- would go a long way toward preserving privacy in the digital age without undermining the business model that has enabled technology companies to thrive.   CHAD MARLOW, NEW YORK   The writer is an advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union focusing on privacy and surveillance issues.   To the Editor:   Privacy and security are both eroding because of technologies built to stockpile, aggregate and reuse every detail of our activities online and off, but the answer should not be to surrender to the idea that this tracking is inevitable.   Simply limiting the use of data does not get at the core problem: an internet that is insecure and hungrily grabs and aggregates everything we do because it serves certain business interests (and government ones -- ask the National Security Agency).   As long as business and the government worship at the altar of surveillance, we will see leaks, breaches and misuses that erode our privacy.   The only way to be sure that our data is protected is not to have it gathered in a reusable form in the first place.   Yes, that includes limiting how data is used, but equally important, it must mean investing in technologies that protect our data and metadata as it travels and when it is stored and empowering us to require that companies ''do not track.''

Justices Take Up Digital Privacy In Case With Roots in a Robbery,"WASHINGTON -- The case that could transform privacy law in the digital era began with the armed robbery of a Radio Shack store in Detroit, a couple of weeks before Christmas in 2010. In the next three months, eight more stores in Michigan and Ohio were robbed at gunpoint. The robbers took bags filled with smartphones. Their own phones would help send them to prison.    On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will consider whether prosecutors violated the Fourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable searches, by collecting vast amounts of data from cellphone companies showing the movements of the man they say organized most of the robberies.    Experts in privacy law said the case, Carpenter v. United States, No. 16-402, was a potential blockbuster.   ''Carpenter could be the most important electronic privacy case of the 21st century,'' said Jeffrey Rosen, the president of the National Constitution Center, a nonprofit group devoted to educating the public about the Constitution.   In a pair of recent decisions, the Supreme Court expressed discomfort with allowing unlimited government access to digital data. It limited the ability of the police to use GPS devices to track suspects' movements, and it required a warrant to search cellphones.   Technology companies including Apple, Facebook and Google have filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to continue to bring Fourth Amendment law into the modern era. ''No constitutional doctrine should presume,'' the brief said, ''that consumers assume the risk of warrantless government surveillance simply by using technologies that are beneficial and increasingly integrated into modern life.''   The court's decision, expected by June, will apply the Fourth Amendment, drafted in the 18th century, to a world in which people's movements are continuously recorded by devices in their cars, pockets and purses, by toll plazas and by transit systems. The court's reasoning may also apply to email and text messages, internet searches, and bank and credit card records.   ''The case is hugely important in that it defines the constitutional role in a really wide range of cases,'' said Orin Kerr, a law professor who will soon join the faculty at the University of Southern California.   The case concerns Timothy Ivory Carpenter, who witnesses said had planned the robberies, supplied guns and served as lookout, typically waiting in a stolen car across the street. ''At his signal, the robbers entered the store, brandished their guns, herded customers and employees to the back, and ordered the employees to fill the robbers' bags with new smartphones,'' a court decision said, summarizing the evidence against him.   In addition to presenting testimony, prosecutors relied on months of records obtained from cellphone companies to prove their case. The records showed that Mr. Carpenter's phone had been nearby when several of the robberies happened. He was convicted and sentenced to 116 years in prison.   Mr. Carpenter's lawyers said cellphone companies had turned over 127 days of records that placed his phone at 12,898 locations, based on information from cellphone towers. Prosecutors could tell whether he had slept at home on given nights and whether he attended his usual church on Sunday mornings.   ''Never before in the history of policing has the government had the time machine it has here,'' said Nathan Freed Wessler, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Mr. Carpenter. Mr. Wessler said prosecutors should be required to obtain a warrant when they seek more than 24 hours' worth of location data.   Older Supreme Court decisions indicate that no warrant was required. In 1979, for instance, in Smith v. Maryland, the Supreme Court ruled that a robbery suspect had no reasonable expectation that his right to privacy extended to the numbers dialed from his landline phone. The court reasoned that the suspect had voluntarily turned over that information to a third party: the phone company.   Relying on the Smith decision's ''third-party doctrine,'' federal appeals courts have said government investigators seeking data from cellphone companies showing users' movements also do not require a warrant.   A federal law, the Stored Communications Act, does require prosecutors to go to court to obtain tracking data, but the showing they must make under the law is not probable cause, the standard for a warrant. Instead, they must demonstrate only that there were ''specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe'' that the records sought ''are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.''   Professor Kerr said Congress was better suited than the courts to strike the right balance between the government's need for information and privacy rights. In Mr. Carpenter's case, he added, the Fourth Amendment should not apply because there was no search.   Mr. Carpenter's lawyers rely on two recent and unanimous Supreme Court decisions expressing discomfort with the collection of large amounts of digital data. In 2014, in Riley v. California, the court said the police must generally have a warrant to search the cellphones of people they arrest.   ''Modern cellphones are not just another technological convenience,'' Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the court. Even the word cellphone is a misnomer, he said. ''They could just as easily be called cameras, video players, Rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps or newspapers,'' the chief justice wrote.   But the Riley case concerned information possessed by the person arrested. Mr. Carpenter's case concerns information held by cellphone companies.   The second case, United States v. Jones, in 2012, concerned a GPS device that the police attached to a suspect's car, allowing them to track his movements for 28 days.   All nine justices agreed that this was problematic under the Fourth Amendment, but they were divided on the rationale for the decision. The majority said the police were not entitled to place the device on private property. But five justices in concurring opinions expressed unease with the government's ability to vacuum up troves of private information.   ''The use of longer-term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy,'' Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for four justices. ''Society's expectation has been that law enforcement agents and others would not -- and indeed, in the main, simply could not -- secretly monitor and catalog every single movement of an individual's car for a very long period.''   Cellphone tower information is not nearly as accurate as that generated by GPS devices, but it is catching up.   Mr. Rosen, who favors broad privacy protections, said Mr. Carpenter's case could transform Fourth Amendment law however the court rules.   ''If the court squarely recognizes what it's been suggesting in recent cases, namely that we do have an expectation of privacy in our digital data and public movements and that the Fourth Amendment prohibits the government from tracking us door to door for weeks in public, that would be an occasion for dancing in the streets,'' he said. ''If the court holds that we don't have an expectation of privacy in public except when there is some sort of physical trespass involved, that could be a huge setback for privacy.''

Want to Search Earnings for English Majors by College? You Can't; Your Money,"If you have children and plan to put them through college, the tuition checks you will eventually write may add up to the largest expense you will ever face. Picking the right college will be one of the most emotionally complex financial decisions of your life. But if you want to know what your children might earn one day if they pursue a particular major at a certain school, comprehensive data covering all students is not available to you. In fact, it's illegal to collect it. Yes, you read that right. You could easily spend days reviewing data on cellular coverage and pricing, or motor vehicle reliability. But when it comes to spending six figures on a college education, per child, the 2008 Higher Education Act prevents you from gathering anything specific about what the return on the investment might be in postgraduation earnings for all degree holders. Now, a battle over a possible reversal of that policy is brewing. A bipartisan coalition of senators including Orrin Hatch and Marco Rubio on the right and Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden on the left (and similar lineups in the House of Representatives) has introduced multiplebills this year that would make the data available.  This week, however, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce proposed a half-measure: Release the data, but only on people who borrow money for their education, because they have already offered up personal financial information when applying for financial aid in the first place. The committee chairwoman, Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, has privacy concerns that keep her from signing on to the bipartisan proposals that would collect postgraduation data on everyone. Supporters of full data transparency believe that this attempt at a compromise is not enough. Moreover, they do not believe the privacy concerns are real. The history here is curious, and the New America Foundation, a policy research institute, recounted it in a paper called ""College Blackout: How the Higher Education Lobby Fought to Keep Students in the Dark,"" a title that probably conveys how the writers, Clare McCann and Amy Laitinen, feel about it. The pair, who worked in the Department of Education during parts of President Barack Obama's two terms, write that while President George W. Bush was in office, there was a strong push toward creating a student and graduate data reporting system. The big idea was to give the department a better sense of its own return on investment, given how much money it spends on higher education each year. The odd thing about the resulting pushback, however, was the lack of unanimity among the higher education lobbying associations. The ones that represent community colleges and big public universities had no unsurmountable concerns with the proposals and support the senators' efforts today. But one group that represents private schools, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, opposed the data collection and dissemination efforts. This opposition reflected concerns about both privacy and security. There was an overarching feeling in higher education that student records were sacrosanct, and deserve protection from snooping politicians and others. The security concerns were and are more specific: In an era when hackers regularly steal data from both government and private systems, why run the risk that millions of graduates' incomes could end up in the hands of bad actors? Advocates for more transparency don't buy these arguments. After all, the data already exists in other places; the proposals on the table merely seek to connect what has already been collected and do so in a safe, secure, anonymous fashion. ""A lot of the history of man and technology has been about balancing risk,"" said Tom Allison, acting director of policy and research at Young Invincibles, a student advocacy group. ""When you started a fire to cook food, there was the danger that fire could hurt you. So I welcome this conversation, but let's not just say 'Privacy!' and then stop it."" One big mystery here is why private colleges would care more about privacy than public or community colleges. New America's Ms. Laitinen dismisses the concern as a smoke screen by an organization whose members sometimes charge a lot more than their competitors. ""What they really wanted was institutional privacy rather than student privacy,"" she said. ""They don't want families to have accurate, comparable data to make one of the most important decisions of their lives."" Sarah A. Flanagan, vice president for government relations and policy development at the private college association, responded by noting that private colleges have the best outcomes when it comes to college completion. ""Our schools have nothing to hide,"" she said. ""This is a question of at what point, and how, do we change privacy protections in order to take statistically valid information that we have to the next level."" Answering that question will probably take at least a year of debate. Ms. Foxx's proposed half-measure this week is just one part of a much larger conversation about dozens of proposed changes that would touch nearly every aspect of how the federal government pays for and regulates higher education. Ms. Flanagan said her organization could live with the proposal that Ms. Foxx made this week. Ms. McCann of New America is not happy with it. In my ideal world, every parent and potential student would be able to search program by program, school by school, to see who dropped out, who finished with how much debt, how much progress they were making on repaying the debt and how much the graduates from each program earned years later, on average. Full transparency. An added bonus would be if we could refine the search to see how low-income Pell Grant recipients did in particular, or minorities. That way families who are themselves in those categories could see how others had done at particular schools. The senators' bipartisan proposals could get us there. Ms. Foxx's idea would not, because it would measure outcomes only for people who borrowed money from the federal government. That would leave out about 30 percent of students, according to federal government figures. ""Unless you're looking at a more comprehensive full set of data, how are you going to know if students from low-income backgrounds are faring worse than those from high-income backgrounds?"" Ms. McCann said. The outrage component here makes it easy to lose sight of more important concerns. Finishing college in the first place ought to be the primary concern, and it often makes sense to pay more to attend a school where students actually get their degrees and do so in a reasonable amount of time. Moreover, salaries are not the only things that matter. We want our children to be happy, to find a good fit, to make lifelong friends and build a career network that helps sustain them. But getting a good job is always at or near the top of the list of results when Young Invincibles surveys its members about what they want out of college. So rather than meekly paying whatever we are told, up to nearly $75,000 a year, all-in, at the most selective colleges, perhaps we ought to be a bit more greedy when demanding data, and more assertive about seeking demonstrated proof of value. Ask administrators for it, and press your elected federal representatives if you would like to see Ms. Foxx and her committee members help create a culture of deep data collection and wide dissemination in higher education. ""Why can't they get with the 21st century?"" asked Peter McPherson, president of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. ""What is wrong with giving that data out? They should think about what they would want their own children to have if they were looking at schools."" PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Robert Neubecker FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)Related Articles   "
"Facial Scans at U.S. Airports Violate Americans' Privacy, Report Says","WASHINGTON -- A new report concludes that a Department of Homeland Security pilot program improperly gathers data on Americans when it requires passengers embarking on foreign flights to undergo facial recognition scans to ensure they haven't overstayed visas. The report, released on Thursday by researchers at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University's law school, called the system an invasive surveillance tool that the department had installed at nearly a dozen airports without going through a required federal rule-making process.  The report's authors examined dozens of Department of Homeland Security documents and raised questions about the accuracy of facial recognition scans. They said the technology had high error rates and were subject to bias, because the scans often fail to properly identify women and African-Americans. ""It's telling that D.H.S. cannot identify a single benefit actually resulting from airport face scans at the departure gate,"" said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the center and an author of the report. ""D.H.S. doesn't need a face-scanning system to catch travelers without a photo on file,"" he added. ""It's alarming that D.H.S. still hasn't supplied evidence for the necessity of this $1 billion program."" Homeland security officials said the program was necessary and fulfilled a decades-old congressional requirement to prevent foreign visitors from overstaying their visas. John Wagner, deputy executive assistant commissioner for field operations at Customs and Border Protection, said American travelers could ask to be inspected other than by a facial scan before boarding flights. He said that at least 90 percent of the scans had correctly identified faces, and that the agency had not encountered gender or racial bias problems with the technology. ""Our job is to meet the mandate and build the system,"" Mr. Wagner said. ""The fact that Congress felt strong enough to set aside a billion dollars to get it done speaks to its need."" The report comes as homeland security officials begin to roll out a biometric exit system that uses facial recognition scanning in 2018 at all American airports with international flights. Customs and Border Protection has been testing a number of biometric programs, teaming up with several airlines in Atlanta, Boston, New York and Washington. It will cost up to $1 billion, raised from certain visa fee surcharges over the next decade. Customs officials say the biometric system has also produced some successes in the pilot testing and has helped catch people who have entered the United States illegally and are traveling on fake documents. They noted that facial scans and fingerprints -- unlike travel documents -- cannot be forged or altered and therefore give agents an additional tool to ensure border security. But Senators Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, expressed concerns about the report's findings. In a letter to Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, the senators urged the department to delay rolling out the facial scans until it addressed the privacy and legal concerns identified in the report. In 1996, Congress ordered the federal government to develop a tracking system for people who overstayed their entry visas. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, an entry- and exit-tracking system was seen as a vital national security and counterterrorism tool. The 9/11 Commission recommended in 2004 that the newly-developed Department of Homeland Security complete a system ""as soon as possible."" Congress has since passed seven separate laws requiring biometric entry-exit screening. But for years, officials have struggled to put a biometric exit system in place because the technology to collect the data was slow to take hold. And many American airports, unlike those in Europe and elsewhere, do not have designated international terminals, leaving little space for additional scanning equipment. The biometric system being tested by the Department of Homeland Security can be used either with a small portable hand-held device or a kiosk equipped with a camera. The system snaps a picture of a passenger leaving the United States and checks the person's face with a gallery of photos maintained by Customs and Border Protection or the State Department. It also checks the person's citizenship or immigration status against various homeland security and intelligence databases. For American citizens, the facial scans are checked against photos from State Department databases. While the system does take facial scans of American citizens, officials at Customs and Border Protection said, the information is used in a very limited way. The officials said scans of Americans were only used to verify identity -- not to collect new information. Mr. Wagner said Customs and Border Protection would comply with a federal process to address concerns before the face scanning system was used at all international terminals at American airports. Laura Moy, who helped write the report, said the Customs and Border Protection assurances were not sufficient. ""They can change their minds on how they use this data at any time, because they haven't put policies in place that govern how it's supposed to be used,"" said Ms. Moy, the deputy director of the Privacy and Technology Center at Georgetown Law. ""This invasive system needs more transparency, and homeland security officials need to address the legal and privacy concerns about this system, before they move forward."" An executive order signed in January by President Trump calls for homeland security officials to speed up the deployment of the biometric system to airports. The United States continues to trail other nations in adopting the technology to collect biometric information. Nearly three dozen countries, including in Europe, Asia and Africa, collect fingerprints, iris scans, and photographs that can be used for facial recognition of people leaving their countries.

What to Ask About Russian Hacking,"Louise Mensch, a New York-based journalist and author, who was a Conservative member of Britain's Parliament from 2010 to 2012, is a digital media executive at the News Corporation. On Monday, the House Intelligence Committee holds its first hearing on Russia's hacking of the election. (No date has yet been set for the Senate Intelligence Committee's parallel investigation.) The list of initial witnesses does not inspire confidence in the House committee's effectiveness. It should be relatively easy to get at the truth of whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia over the hacking. I have some relevant experience. When I was a member of Parliament in Britain, I took part in a select committee investigating allegations of phone hacking by the News Corporation. Today, as a New York-based journalist (who, in fact, now works at News Corp.), I have followed the Russian hacking story closely. In November, I broke the story that a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court had issued a warrant that enabled the F.B.I. to examine communications between ''U.S. persons'' in the Trump campaign relating to Russia-linked banks.     So, I have some ideas for how the House committee members should proceed. If I were Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat on the committee, I would demand to see the following witnesses: Carter Page, Paul Manafort, Richard Burt, Erik Prince, Dan Scavino, Brad Parscale, Roger Stone, Corey Lewandowski, Boris Epshteyn, Rudolph Giuliani, Michael Flynn, Michael Flynn Jr., Felix Sater, Dmitry Rybolovlev, Michael Cohen, Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel, Robert and Rebekah Mercer, Stephen Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, Michael Anton, Julia Hahn and Stephen Miller, along with executives from Cambridge Analytica, Alfa Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Spectrum Health.   There are many more who need to be called, but these would be a first step. As to lines of questioning, here are some suggestions.   To the White House director of social media, Dan Scavino: ''You tweeted an anti-Semitic meme about Hillary Clinton from Donald Trump's account during the election. That meme appeared to have come from an automated account on a Russian-controlled network of malware-infected computers, or botnet. What knowledge did you have of the existence of a network of fake Twitter profiles that supported your campaign and were partisans of Russia?''   To the Trump campaign adviser and businessman Carter Page: ''You have said that the Trump campaign approved your July visit to give a speech in Moscow. Provide the committee with a full list of everyone you spoke to during that trip and describe precisely what was discussed. Were sanctions ever a topic?   ''When you met the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, what was the conversation?   ''When you returned to Moscow after the election, you presented slides comparing Rex Tillerson and Hillary Clinton as secretaries of state before Mr. Tillerson was announced as Mr. Trump's choice. Who told you Mr. Tillerson would be the pick?   ''Stephen Miller, then a campaign spokesman, stated that Jeff Sessions was putting together the foreign policy team. How were you recruited to that team? What contact did you have with its head, Mr. Sessions?   ''Did you at any time discuss leaking, hacking, WikiLeaks, the release of emails phished from the Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta, or any other information not publicly available on Mrs. Clinton, or any person related to her campaign, with any Russian national, in the United States or elsewhere?   ''Describe any and all financial discussions you had with any person during the campaign about the sale of a 19.5 percent stake in the state-owned Russian oil company Rosneft.''   To the former Alabama senator, now attorney general, Mr. Sessions: ''Describe any communications, not merely meetings, you had with Russian citizens during the campaign. Did you ever discuss a shift in policy on Ukraine to be exchanged for the lifting of sanctions?   ''Describe in full the content of your conversations with Mr. Kislyak. Were you aware that the Russian ambassador was also alleged to be a  recruiter of spies?   ''Did you select Mr. Page as a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign? If not, who did? Why did you consider him suitable to serve on your team?   ''To your knowledge, did you break the law during the campaign? If so, how? To your knowledge, did anyone else related to the Trump campaign break the law during the campaign?   ''Did you have any knowledge during the campaign of serving F.B.I. agents and police officers whom Rudy Giuliani, Erik Prince and Mr. Flynn claimed were leaking information to them? Did you advise anybody involved that this was against the law? If not, why not?   ''Did you know Mr. Flynn was lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his calls to Russia? Did you know Mr. Flynn misled Vice President Pence on the matter of his son's security clearance?   ''Do you have any knowledge, direct or indirect, whether Mr. Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen, or any member of his family, traveled out of the country to meet with Russians during the campaign? Do you have knowledge of whether Mr. Cohen, or any Trump associate, directly or through shell companies, made payments either to hackers or to internet companies that ran a botnet of fake accounts and websites on behalf of Russia?''   On Nov. 7, I reported that sources had told me of the existence of a FISA warrant targeting two Russia-linked banks. That warrant gave permission for the communications of American citizens that were incidentally collected as part of that investigation to be examined. (I did not report the existence of a wiretap, nor do I have any knowledge of such.)   This is an issue of the utmost consequence. If Mr. Trump's tweet alleging that Trump Tower was wiretapped on the orders of President Barack Obama was untrue, Mr. Trump is guilty of a slur. If, however, the president tweeted real news, he revealed the existence of intercepts that cover members of his team in a continuing investigation. That would be obstruction of justice, potentially an impeachable offense.   The framing of the committee's questions matters immensely. Legally, witnesses cannot confirm or deny even the existence of a current national security investigation. The very mention of a ''FISA warrant'' would allow Mr. Sessions to avoid the substance by excusing himself from commenting. Committee members must therefore word their questions without reference to any case. I would simply ask Mr. Sessions this:   ''Was the president's tweet about a wiretap at Trump Tower, to your knowledge, illegal? If so, to whom have you reported this offense?   ''To your knowledge, did any person illegally inform the president that there was a wiretap at Trump Tower?''   The president's unwillingness to answer questions about contacts between his campaign team and Russian officials, and the pattern of contradictory and misleading statements on those contacts, are toxic. Never in American history has a president been suspected of collaborating with a hostile foreign power to win an election. The founders provided three equal branches of government to protect the republic. The American people now depend on the House committee to do its job and uncover the truth.

Russians Ridicule U.S. Charge That Kremlin Meddled to Help Trump,"MOSCOW - Spies are usually thought of as bystanders who quietly steal secrets in the shadows. But the Russian versions, schooled in techniques used during the Cold War against the United States, have a more ambitious goal - shaping, not just snooping on, the politics of a nation that the Soviet-era K.G.B. targeted as the ""main adversary."" That at least is the conclusion of a declassified report released on Friday that outlines what America's top intelligence agencies view as an elaborate ""influence campaign"" ordered by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia aimed at skewing the outcome of the 2016 presidential race. But the absence of any concrete evidence in the report of meddling by the Kremlin was met with a storm of mockery on Saturday by Russian politicians and commentators, who took to social media to ridicule the report as a potpourri of baseless conjecture.  In a message posted on Twitter, Alexey Pushkov, a member of the defense and security committee of the upper house of the Russian Parliament, ridiculed the American report as akin to C.I.A. assertions that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction: ""Mountain gave birth to a mouse: all accusations against Russia are based on 'confidence' and assumptions. US was sure about Hussein possessing WMD in the same way."" Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, a state-funded television network that broadcasts in English, who is cited repeatedly in the report, posted her own message on Twitter scoffing at the American intelligence community's accusations. ""Aaa, the CIA report is out! Laughter of the year! Intro to my show from 6 years ago is the main evidence of Russia's influence at US elections. This is not a joke!"" she wrote. Even Russians who have been critical of their government voiced dismay at the United States intelligence agencies' account of an elaborate Russian conspiracy unsupported by solid evidence. Alexey Kovalev, a Russian journalist who has followed and frequently criticized RT, said he was aghast that the report had given so much attention to the television station. ""I do have a beef with RT and their chief,"" Mr. Kovalev wroteon Twitter, ""But they are not your nemesis, America. Please chill."" The Kremlin, which has in the past repeatedly denied any role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee computer system, had no immediate response to the declassified report. Mr. Putin instead made a show of business as usual, attending a church service to mark the start of Orthodox Christmas. The report provides no new evidence to support assertions that Moscow meddled covertly through hacking and other actions to boost the electoral chances of Donald J. Trump and undermine his rival, Hillary Clinton, but rests instead on what it describes as Moscow's long record of trying to influence America's political system. ""Russia, like its Soviet predecessor, has a history of conducting covert influence campaigns focused on U.S. presidential elections that have used intelligence officers and agents and press placements to disparage candidates perceived as hostile to the Kremlin,"" the report said. This campaign, it said, blended covert activities like hacking with public action by ""Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries and paid social media users or 'trolls.' "" The public report did not include evidence on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates that intelligence officials said was in a classified version. Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian intelligence agencies at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, said he was skeptical of the accusation that Mr. Putin had ordered the hacking. All the same, he added, Russian spies, like their Soviet predecessors, ""don't just collect information but try to assert influence."" United States intelligence operatives, he said, have often done the same thing but the Russians, convinced that the United States orchestrated protests in Ukraine in 2014 that toppled the pro-Moscow president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and other popular uprisings in former Soviet lands, ""have a more aggressive approach to meddling in other people's politics."" Particularly since Mr. Yanukovych lost power after protests in Maidan Square in Kiev, Mr. Galeotti said, Mr. Putin and his circle ""have a different sense of how the game is played. They genuinely believe that Maidan was engineered by the West"" and because of this ""all bets are off"" in their view, a shift that has legitimized ""the principle of regime change or at least regime disturbance"" through mischief making in the United States election. That Russia considers it possible to influence United States elections has been evident since at least 1968 when, according to Moscow's former longtime ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin, the Kremlin decided that Richard M. Nixon was ""profoundly anti-Soviet"" and must be prevented if possible from winning the presidency. Mr. Dobrynin, in his 1995 memoir ""In Confidence,"" said he was ordered by Moscow to offer Mr. Nixon's Democratic rival, Hubert H. Humphrey Jr., ""any conceivable help in his election campaign - including financial aid."" Mr. Dobrynin related in his memoir how he thought this was a bad idea but nonetheless made an oblique offer of help to Mr. Humphrey during a breakfast at the Democratic candidate's home. ""He knew at once what was going on,"" Mr. Dobrynin recalled, and made it clear he had no interest in receiving any Soviet assistance. To try to bring about change that suited Moscow's interests, the K.G.B. set up a special department dedicated to ""active measures."" This unit went beyond collecting intelligence and embraced measures aimed at changing the course of events around the world. These included disinformation and subversion, often involving various front organizations and Moscow-funded fringe parties that worked to shape the politics of foreign countries. While propaganda and disinformation have long been key elements in efforts by both Moscow and Washington to shape events, the Kremlin, at least during the Cold War, went to extraordinary lengths to undermine foreign political figures it viewed as hostile to Soviet interests. The K.G.B. fabricated a bogus F.B.I. report that Senator Henry M. Jackson, a strong critic of the Soviet Union who tried unsuccessfully in the 1970s to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, was a homosexual and attended gay sex clubs with Richard N. Perle, another anti-Communist hawk who was loathed by Moscow. Another target was President Carter's Polish-born national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski. This tradition of maligning Moscow's foes on the United States political stage continued in the prelude to the November election with state-funded Russian media outlets, particularly the television network RT, which broadcasts in English, giving extensive coverage to negative news and allegations about Mrs. Clinton. ""What we see now is a modernized version of the old tool kit of the U.S.S.R.,"" said Lorant Gyori, an analyst with Political Capital, a research group in Budapest that has studied Russian efforts to shape political events in Europe. He added that Russia's intelligence services, after a long lull following the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, had in recent years again switched from ""just getting information to also getting influence."" Mark Kramer, an expert on the Cold War at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard, said the declassified report had erred by stating that the Russian ""influence campaign"" directed at the November election marked a ""significant escalation"" of previous Russian operations. This assessment, he said, ""is simply untrue"" and reflects a lack of understanding of just how extensive Moscow's meddling has been in the past. ""The reality is that the two main Soviet intelligence and security agencies waged a vigorous campaign for decades to meddle in U.S. politics and discredit the United States,"" Mr. Kramer said in an email. Mr. Galeotti, the intelligence expert in Prague, cautioned that this mission to influence foreign politics was not a uniquely Russian phenomenon but had also been embraced in the past by the C.I.A., which, in the 1950s, sought to shape and subvert politics in countries like Iran and Guatemala. He said the United States intelligence report on Russian meddling in the November election had gone too far in projecting Cold War attitudes onto today's reality. He said it was a mistake to suppose that Mr. Putin had from the start conducted ""a Machiavellian conspiracy"" aimed at bringing Mr. Trump to power. More likely, he added, was that Mr. Putin was not involved or even informed about initial efforts to hack into the D.N.C. computer system but, informed after the fact about what had been done, ""decided to act opportunistically."" ""I don't think the Russians believed for a minute that Trump could really be elected,"" Mr. Galeotti said in a telephone interview. ""They were convinced that U.S. elites would ensure that one of their own would win. They thought they had a chance to do a bit of mischief but I think they were amazed, even aghast, at what happened."" Oleg Matsnev and Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow.

What We Know and Don't Know About the Trump-Russia Dossier," How did American intelligence officials come to brief President Obama, President-elect Donald J. Trump and lawmakers about supposed Russian plans to blackmail Mr. Trump? There are far more questions than answers. But here is a look at the story so far. What We Know  "" In September 2015, a Washington political research firm, Fusion GPS, paid by a wealthy Republican donor who did not like Mr. Trump, began to compile ""opposition research"" on him - standard practice in politics. "" Last June, after evidence of Russian hacking of Democratic targets surfaced, Fusion GPS hired a retired British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, to investigate Mr. Trump's ties to Russia. "" After it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee, Democratic clients who supported Hillary Clinton began to pay Fusion GPS for this same opposition research. "" Mr. Steele, who had long experience in Russia and a network of connections there, compiled dozens of reports detailing what he heard from his contacts. The memos he wrote, mostly one to three pages long, are dated from June to December. "" The memos contain unsubstantiated claims that Russian officials tried to obtain influence over Mr. Trump by preparing to blackmail him with sex tapes and bribe him with business deals. They also claim that the Trump campaign met with Russian operatives to discuss the Russians' hacking and leaking of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee and from Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. "" Fusion GPS and Mr. Steele shared the memos first with their clients, and later with the F.B.I. and multiple journalists at The New York Times and elsewhere. The memos, totaling about 35 pages, also reached a number of members of Congress. "" Last week, when the F.B.I., C.I.A. and National Security Agency gave a classified report on the Russian hacking, leaking and efforts to influence the presidential election to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders, they attached a two-page summary of the unverified allegations in the memos. What We Don't Know "" Whether any of the claims in the memos are true. American intelligence agencies have not confirmed them, and Mr. Trump has said they are a complete fabrication. In addition, one specific allegation - that Mr. Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen met with a Russian official in Prague in August or September - has been denied by both Mr. Cohen, who says he has never been to Prague, and the Russian, Oleg Solodukhin. "" Who concocted the information in the memos, if it is entirely false or partly so, and with what purpose. If all the information in the dossier is false, it is a very sophisticated fabrication. "" What exactly prompted American intelligence officials to pass on a summary of the unvetted claims to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and Congress. Officials have said they felt the president-elect should be aware of the memos, which had circulated widely in Washington. But putting the summary in a report that went to multiple people in Congress and the executive branch made it very likely that it would be leaked. What will happen now? The F.B.I. has been investigating the claims in the memos, and Democrats are demanding a thorough inquiry into the reports that Trump representatives met with Russian officials during the campaign. But as of Jan. 20, Mr. Trump will be in charge of the bureau and the other intelligence agencies, and he may not approve such an investigation. Why can't I read the memos on your website? Because the 35 pages of memos prepared as opposition research on Mr. Trump contain detailed claims that neither the intelligence agencies nor The Times has been able to verify, Times editors decided to briefly summarize the claims and not publish the document. Why did The Times report extensively on the hacking of the Democratic Party, but not this? The Times did report before the election that the F.B.I. was investigating claims about Mr. Trump's ties to Russia - an article that resulted from an extensive reporting effort. The Democratic National Committee and Podesta emails were public, their authenticity was not in doubt, and they contained newsworthy information. Why did the F.B.I. director write two letters about Clinton's emails, but not this? That is a question the director, James B. Comey, may eventually have to answer. His two public statements about the bureau's investigation of the Clinton emails broke with long F.B.I. tradition. Why did the news media not raise this during the campaign? Many reporters from multiple news organizations tried to verify the claims in the memos but were unsuccessful. So what changed on Tuesday? Why is this now being reported? CNN broke the news that a summary of the memos had been attached to the classified report by the F.B.I., C.I.A. and National Security Agency on the Russian hacking and leaking, and that it had been given to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders last week. That level of official attention prompted news organizations to decide to inform the public about the memos.

The Trumps Embraced a Russian Plot,"The astonishing email just released by Donald Trump Jr., setting up the meeting last year with a Russian lawyer, is devastating for the White House. Above all, it underscores that the Trump family knew of a secret Russian campaign to interfere in the American election-and embraced it.  Read the whole email exchange, but here's the key paragraph: ""The Crown prosecutor of Russia...offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."" This passage undermines the Trump and White House position in three crucial ways-not attributed to vague ""sources"" but in black and white documentary form. Here's what the email does: 1. It shows that the Russian government was behind the effort. This is the Kremlin, not random Russians. 2. The Russian government is offering ""sensitive"" information and ""official documents"" that would incriminate Hillary Clinton. The clear implication is that this material is stolen by spies, probably hacked, for how else would the Russian government have it? 3. The offer is part of a pattern of the Russian ""government's support for Mr. Trump."" Put these three points together, and it's clear from the email that the Russian government has picked sides and is trying to secretly affect the outcome of the American presidential race by providing stolen information about a former secretary of state. For months, the Trumps have been publicly doubting that the Russian government interfered in the U.S. election, when Donald Trump Jr. had email evidence of this effort in June 2016! The moment he got this email, Donald Trump Jr. should have called the F.B.I. That's what the Al Gore campaign did in 2000 when it received a Bush campaign briefing booklet. It's one thing to do opposition research; everybody does that. It's another thing to use stolen information secretly provided by a rival nation where journalists and dissidents end up dead. Instead of calling the F.B.I., Donald Trump Jr. responded ""I love it."" He then summoned Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort to join the meeting. In other words, informed of a covert Russian effort to use espionage to interfere with the U.S. election, he embraced it.I don't know whether this is criminal. I do know that it's disgraceful. This is also arguably ""soft collusion,"" acceptance of a foreign power's interference in an election for one's own benefit. Whether there was a quid pro quo and ""hard collusion,"" we'll have to see. We do have the outlines of a quid pro quo, in which each side was signalling what it wanted: The Trump campaign wanted dirt on the Clintons, and Russia wanted an easing of sanctions if Trump was elected. After this meeting, the Trumps or the White House denied at least eight times that such a meeting had taken place. That is duplicity on top of collusion. Nobody should be heartened by this. It's a sad day for the country.  "
"Move Over, Bitcoin. It's Ether's Turn To Win Fans.","The price of Bitcoin has hit record highs in recent months, more than doubling in price since the start of the year. Despite these gains, Bitcoin is on the verge of losing its position as the dominant virtual currency. The value of Ether, the digital money that lives on an upstart network known as Ethereum, has risen an eye-popping 4,500 percent since the beginning of the year.    With the recent price increases, the outstanding units of the Ether currency were worth around $34 billion as of Monday -- or 82 percent as much as all the Bitcoin in existence. At the beginning of the year, Ether was only about 5 percent as valuable as Bitcoin.   The sudden rise of Ethereum highlights how volatile the bewildering world of virtual currency remains, where lines of computer code can be spun into billions of dollars in a matter of months.    Bitcoin, the breakout digital currency, is also hitting new highs -- one Bitcoin was worth $2,600 on Monday. But the Bitcoin community has struggled with technical issues and bitter internal divisions among its biggest supporters. It has also been tainted by its association with online drug sales and hackers demanding ransom.   Against this backdrop, Ether has been gaining steam. The two-year old system has picked up backing from both tech geeks and big corporate names like JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft, which are excited about Ethereum's goal of providing not only a digital currency but also a new type of global computing network, which generally requires Ether to use.   In a recent survey of 1,100 virtual currency users, 94 percent were positive about the state of Ethereum, while only 49 percent were positive about Bitcoin, the industry publication CoinDesk said this month.   If recent trends continue, the value of Ethereum's virtual currency could race past Bitcoin's in the coming weeks. Virtual currency fanatics are monitoring the value of each and waiting for the two currencies to switch place, a moment that has been called ''the flippening.''   ''The momentum has shifted to Ethereum -- there is no doubt about that,'' said William Mougayar, the founder of Virtual Capital Ventures, which invests in a variety of virtual currencies and start-ups. ''There is almost nothing you can do with Bitcoin that you can't do with Ethereum.''   Even though most of the people buying Ether and Bitcoin are individual investors, the gains that both have experienced have taken what was until very recently a quirky fringe experiment into the realm of big money. The combined value of all Ether and Bitcoin is now worth more than the market value of PayPal and is approaching the size of Goldman Sachs.   Investors buying Ether are placing a bet that people will want to use the Ethereum network's computing capabilities and will need the currency to do so. But that is far from a sure thing. And real-world use of the network is still scant.   Bitcoin, on the other hand, has made inroads into mainstream commerce, with companies like Overstock.com and Expedia accepting Bitcoin for purchases, along with the black-market operators who use the currency.   The fact that there are fewer real-world uses for Ethereum has many market experts expecting a crash similar to the ones that have followed previous run-ups in the price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Even during recent pullbacks, though, the value of Ether has generally continued to gain on Bitcoin in relative terms.   Ethereum was launched in the middle of 2015 by a 21-year-old college dropout, Vitalik Buterin, who was born in Russia and raised in Canada. He now lists his residence, jokingly, as Cathay Pacific Airlines because of his travel schedule.   The Ether he holds has made him a millionaire many times over, but he has generally avoided commenting on the price increase in Ether.   Mr. Buterin was inspired by Bitcoin, and the software he built shares some of the same basic qualities. Both are hosted and maintained by the computers of volunteers around the world, who are rewarded for their participation with the new digital tokens that are released onto the network each day.   Because the virtual currencies are tracked and maintained by a network of computers, no government or company is in charge. The prices of both Bitcoin and Ether are established on private exchanges, where people can sell the tokens they own at the going market price.   But Ethereum was designed to do much more than just serve as a digital money. The network of computers hooked into Ethereum can be harnessed to do computational work, essentially making it possible to run computer programs on the network, or what are referred to as decentralized applications, or Dapps. This has led to an enormous community of programmers working on the software.   One of the first applications to take off was a user-led venture capital fund of sorts, known as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. After raising over $150 million last summer, the project crashed and burned, and appeared ready to take Ethereum with it.   But the way that Mr. Buterin and other developers dealt with the problems, returning the hacked Ether to users, won him the respect of many in the corporate world.   ''It was good to see that there is governance on Ethereum and that they can fix issues in a timely manner if they have to,'' said Eric Piscini, who leads the team looking into virtual currency technology at the consulting firm Deloitte.   Many applications being built on Ethereum are also raising money using the Ether currency, in what are known as initial coin offerings, a play on initial public offerings.   Start-ups that have followed this path have generally collected Ether from investors and exchanged them for units of their own specialized virtual currency, leaving the entrepreneurs with the Ether to convert into dollars and spend on operational expenses.   These coin offerings, which have proliferated in recent months, have created a surge of demand for the Ether currency. Just last week, investors sent $150 million worth of Ether to a start-up, Bancor, that wants to make it easier to launch virtual currencies. If projects like Bancor stumble, Ether could as well.   Several big companies have also been building programs on top of Ethereum, including the mining company BHP Billiton, which has built a trial program to track its raw materials, and JPMorgan, which is working on a system to monitor trading.   Over the last few months, over 100 companies have joined the nonprofit Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, including global names like Toyota, Merck and Samsung, to build tools that will make Ethereum useful in corporate settings.   Many of the companies using Ethereum are building their own private versions of the software, which won't make use of the Ether currency. Speculators are betting that these companies will eventually plug their software into the broader Ethereum network.   There is, though, also the possibility that none of these big trials come to fruition, and the current excitement fizzles out, as has happened many times in the past with Bitcoin after big price surges.   ''I hope this is the year where we start to close the gap between the speculative value and the actual value,'' Mr. Mougayar said. ''There is a lot at stake right now.''     "
Government Spying Allegations in Mexico Spur Calls for Inquiry,"MEXICO CITY -- After reports this week that sophisticated government-owned surveillance software was used to spy on some of Mexico's most prominent journalists and activists, victims and others have demanded an independent inquiry into the allegations. The calls came in response to an article by The New York Times and to a parallel report by several Mexican and international organizations, both of which found that the Israeli-made spyware, which was sold to the Mexican government on the strict condition that it be used only against terrorists and criminal groups, was deployed against some of the government's most outspoken critics.     The software, called Pegasus, can infiltrate a smartphone and allow spies to monitor all activity on it, including calls, texts and emails.   Nine victims of the spyware campaign have filed a criminal complaint with the Mexican attorney general's office. They include lawyers looking into the still-unsolved disappearance of 43 students in 2014; a leader of an initiative to pass anticorruption legislation; and the journalist who uncovered a scandal involving the family of President Enrique Peña Nieto.   Those calling for an investigation say the only way a truly independent inquiry can be guaranteed is to bring in an international team of experts, as the government did after the students disappeared. The government, however, ended that group's mandate before its work was complete.   ''Will the government have the capacity and will to investigate itself?'' asked Mario E. Patrón, the executive director of the Miguel Augustín Pro Juárez Human Rights Center, a human rights group in Mexico that was among the targets of the spyware attacks. ''I think we all know what the answer is.''   The Times's article and the report -- produced by a group of organizations in conjunction with the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto -- cautioned that there was no conclusive evidence that linked the spying to specific government agencies in Mexico.   A spokesman for the Peña Nieto administration issued a statement on Monday emphasizing that point and using it to defend the government. ''For the government of the republic, the respect of privacy and the protection of personal data of all individuals are inherent values of our liberty, democracy and rule of law,'' said the spokesman, Daniel Millán.   He invited people ''who could have been victims of the actions described in the article'' to present their complaints to the attorney general's office.   Still, the findings provoked broad outrage, with many laying responsibility -- if not for the spying itself, then at least to initiate a thorough inquiry -- on the shoulders of the administration.   ''This new, chilling evidence confirms that Mexican journalists and human rights defenders are a target of illegal practices designed to interfere and hinder their work,'' Erika Guevara-Rosas, the Americas director at Amnesty International, said in a statement. The findings ''show a clear pattern of illegal use of technology in an attempt to control any criticism against those in power.''   In a measure of the volume of reaction, the hashtag #GobiernoEspía, or #SpyGovernment, became the top trending topic on Twitter in Mexico on Monday and a top trending topic globally. In Mexico, the topic dominated social media and figured prominently in the news media on Monday and into Tuesday.   The level of anger was likened by some to the public reaction that greeted the so-called Casa Blanca scandal in 2014. That was spurred by reports that the president's wife had received a special deal on the purchase of a mansion from a government contractor close to the president.   The episode weakened Mr. Peña Nieto's standing and cast doubt on his stated commitment to the rule of law.   The administration has in recent weeks also been under pressure to better protect journalists.   At least 104 journalists have been killed in Mexico since 2000, including six this year so far, and at least 25 others have disappeared, according to press freedom groups.   The pressure on the government intensified last month with the killing of Javier Valdez Cárdenas, a widely respected journalist who reported drug trafficking in his home state, Sinaloa.   The findings this week ''only add to the idea that, rather than protecting the press, the Mexican government views it as a dissident group or even as an enemy,'' Guillermo Osorno, a founder of Horizontal.mx, a digital magazine, wrote in an opinion piece published by The New York Times en Español.   But the reaction was also mitigated somewhat by a certain cynicism in a country where wiretapping has been a time-honored tradition in politics, and allegations of spying by the government against its critics are not new.   Raymundo Riva Palacio, a columnist for El Financiero newspaper, wrote Tuesday that in 2015, the paper reported on an extensive government spying program that targeted cellphones. In response, he said, ''nothing happened.''   He welcomed the reports this week ''for the possibility of finally provoking a reaction from President Enrique Peña Nieto.''   But many commentators have been underwhelmed by the administration's early response, which struck some as highly defensive and a reaffirmation of the widely held view that the government is more interested in preserving its authority than in enforcing the rule of law.   ''If it wasn't them, isn't the Mexican government worried that someone is going around spying?'' wrote Carlos Puig, a columnist for the Milenio newspaper. ''Shouldn't it be the government itself asking for an investigation? Or is it simply that they already know the answer?''     "
Escaping the Scareware Alert,"Q. I sometimes get obviously fake virus alerts invading my desktop browser, but the only option to make the box go away is to click the O.K. button -- which I am afraid to do. Where do these things come from, and is there an easier way to get out of this besides shutting down the whole computer?  A. Fraudulent virus messages have been popping up in browsers and other parts of operating systems for years, and Windows users are not the only people getting them. The false alerts can be triggered by clicking on a malicious link, mistyping a web address that leads to a scammer's site, landing on a page running malevolent scripts (or hosting poisoned advertisements) and other actions.    Even if a scareware alert pops up, you can dismiss it without rebooting your whole computer -- just forcibly quit the browser program. On a Windows PC, hold down the Control, Alt and Delete keys to open the Task Manager app, select the browser from the list of running programs and click End Task. On a Mac, press the Option, Command and Escape keys, select the browser in the list of programs and click the Force Quit button.   If your browser is set to remember open tabs when it closes, decline the offer to open them again when the program starts. If the pop-up returns right away, going into the browser's settings and clearing the recent history and cache may flush out lingering traces of the fake alert; resetting the browser to restore it to its original vanilla state is a further step.   Maintaining a real, regularly updated security program on your computer can keep general malicious code at bay. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, Avast and AVG are among the companies that offer free basic security software for Windows and Mac systems, with the option to move to a more full-featured suite for a fee.

"Post-Snowden Efforts to Secure N.S.A. Data Fell Short, Report Says","WASHINGTON -- The government's efforts to tighten access to its most sensitive surveillance and hacking data after the leaks of National Security Agency files by Edward J. Snowden fell short, according to a newly declassified report. The N.S.A. failed to consistently lock racks of servers storing highly classified data and to secure data center machine rooms, according to the report, an investigation by the Defense Department's inspector general completed in 2016. The report was classified at the time and made public in redacted form this week in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by The New York Times.    The agency also failed to meaningfully reduce the number of officials and contractors who were empowered to download and transfer data classified as top secret, as well as the number of ''privileged'' users, who have greater power to access the N.S.A.'s most sensitive computer systems. And it did not fully implement software to monitor what those users were doing.    In all, the report concluded, while the post-Snowden initiative -- called ''Secure the Net'' by the N.S.A. -- had some successes, it ''did not fully meet the intent of decreasing the risk of insider threats to N.S.A. operations and the ability of insiders to exfiltrate data.''   In a statement, Vanee Vines, an N.S.A. spokeswoman, noted the difficulty of building security improvements into the agency's particularly complex systems while continuing to carry out its work.   ''We welcome the observations and opportunities for improvement offered by the U.S. Defense Department's Inspector General,'' she said. ''N.S.A. has never stopped seeking and implementing ways to strengthen both security policies and internal controls.''   Underscoring the importance of the warnings in the report, in the same month that it was produced, August 2016, a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers announced that it had obtained and was auctioning off highly classified N.S.A. hacking tools -- some of which it later dumped online, forming the basis of a malicious software attack that spread chaos around the world last month.   Also in August, a veteran intelligence contractor, Harold T. Martin III, was charged with copying and bringing home 50 terabytes of confidential data from the N.S.A. and other agencies.   The report portrayed certain aspects of the N.S.A.'s internal controls as particularly sloppy before the Snowden breach in 2013. The inspector general found that the agency was unable to say how many privileged users and officials were empowered to transfer data. Those lists were kept in spreadsheets that had become corrupted and were no longer available.   The agency sought to reduce access by revoking it and requiring users to reapply for credentials. But the inspector general concluded that the step had not significantly reduced the overall number of people with the extraordinary authorities.   The report said the chief information officer of the N.S.A., Gregory L. Smithberger, had cautioned the inspector general that ''eliminating all risk of insider threats is not feasible.'' In a separate response included with the report, Mr. Smithberger focused on other areas where the agency had succeeded in tightening controls, portraying the inspector general's broader findings as positive.   ''While the media leak events that led to Secure the Net (STN) were both unforeseen and serious, we consider the extensive progress we made in a short time to be a 'good news' story,'' he wrote.   The inspector general studied how well the agency did in carrying out seven of the initiative's 40 components. Its report was commissioned by Congress, and though it was deemed classified, the House Intelligence Committee cited a finding from it in a declassified report about the intelligence community's response to the Snowden disclosures.

What to Do When Windows Updates Fail,"Q. Why is it that some Windows updates just refuse to install? In other words, when one goes into update history and it shows an update that has failed to install a number of times, what can you do?  A. Windows Update is the service Microsoft provides within the Windows operating system to automatically download and install security patches and system fixes, but it is not without occasional malfunctions of its own. (Hiccups with getting certain updates to install or the service to work smoothly are not limited to Windows 10, as Windows Update has been around for years through many versions of the operating system.)    If you check your Windows Update History in the Settings app and see a particular update has failed to install, restart the PC and then try running Windows Update again. Make sure the computer stays connected to the internet and has not shut down before the software has fully downloaded and gone through the installation process, as those disruptions can cause update problems.   Because malicious software can also interfere, keep your system's security software current (using Windows Defender/Microsoft Security Essentials or any third-party program) and scan the computer for malware. Check your hard drive to make sure it has at least 10 gigabytes of free space available for Windows Update to use, and make sure the date and time on your PC are accurate.   If your own basic troubleshooting fails to get the update installed, Microsoft's website has its own Windows Update Troubleshooter tool for Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 that you can download and use to sort out certain issues. Despite the best intentions, some updates are simply buggy and will not install no matter what you do. Browsing Windows-focused blogs and Microsoft's own online tech forums might point you to information or workarounds for installing problematic updates.

New Debate Seems Likely Over iPhone Of Gunman,"More than a year after Apple battled the F.B.I. over the unlocking of an iPhone, a new skirmish may be brewing between the authorities and the company over privacy and strong encryption on its devices. Here is the situation    Devin P. Kelley, who shot 26 people to death in a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., on Sunday, owned an iPhone. That phone may contain evidence that could help law enforcement officials, but the authorities have not unlocked the device to peruse its contents.    In a news conference on Tuesday, the F.B.I. said that it had not been able to get into the device owned by the gunman, but it did not specify the type of phone or the operating system.   Apple said that it was ''shocked and saddened'' by the shooting and that it worked with law enforcement every day. ''We offer training to thousands of agents so they understand our devices and how they can quickly request information from Apple,'' the company said.   IPhone security   Apple devices are some of the most secure on the market, and people typically lock them with passwords. Fingerprints can also be used to unlock the device on a biometric scanner.   Someone trying to break into your iPhone would have 10 attempts at typing in a password. If all of those attempts failed, the iPhone would automatically wipe itself clean as a safeguard for its owner's privacy.   After the F.B.I.'s news conference on Tuesday, Apple said, it immediately reached out to law enforcement. ''We offered assistance and said we would expedite our response to any legal process they send us,'' Apple said.   Past issues with passwords   The situation is a reminder of last year's fight between Apple and the F.B.I. At the time, law enforcement wanted to get into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 of Mr. Farook's co-workers at a holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif., in late 2015.   In that case, a federal judge ordered Apple to help the F.B.I. The judge asked Apple to ''bypass or disable'' the security feature that wipes a phone clean after 10 incorrect password attempts. Apple argued that creating the technology to bypass its own security would compromise its users' safety.   Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, penned a 1,100-word letter to customers, warning that the government's request would lead to a ''chilling'' breach of privacy.   What the authorities can do   In the aftermath of the Sutherland Springs shooting, the authorities could have used Mr. Kelley's fingers for up to 48 hours after he last opened his iPhone to activate the biometric Touch ID function to gain access to the device. It is unclear why officials did not do so. After 48 hours, law enforcement would need a pass code to open the phone.   In the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. was ultimately able to open the iPhone without help from Apple. It's unclear what methods law enforcement has tried in the Texas case.   Whether or not the government finds evidence on Mr. Kelley's iPhone, the case could again thrust Apple into the middle of a debate over how we balance the needs of citizens and their right to privacy with the needs of law enforcement working on tough cases.

India's judges rule for freedom,"Menaka Guruswamy, a lawyer at the Supreme Court of India, is visiting faculty at Columbia Law School. On Aug. 24, the Supreme Court of India, in a rare unanimous judgment, declared privacy a constitutional right. The court unflinchingly reasoned that the rights to life and liberty of which privacy is a part protect the sanctity of the home and relationships like marriage, procreation and sexual orientation.    It is a ruling that will forever affect the social fabric of this country and reaffirm a constitutional morality in a time of deep social and political division -- a judgment that can be equated with Brown v. Board of Education in the United States.    The ruling comes as the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which came to power in 2014, is attempting a cultural reconfiguration of Indian society -- policing choices about food, gender roles, sexuality, marriage and religion. Such actions are at odds with the values of secularism, equality and dignity, and freedom of expression, conscience and religion that are enshrined in India's progressive Constitution of 1950. This troubling context makes the decision of the Supreme Court especially empowering.   The Supreme Court is also ground zero for challenges to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to force all Indians to sign up for the biometric databank, called the Aadhar project, in which retina scans, fingerprints and demographic information is stored under 12-digit unique identification numbers. The privacy ruling was necessary since the constitutional status of privacy had to be established before the court adjudicated on various challenges to the Aadhar database that are still pending.   The government has mandated that Aadhar data be linked to citizens' information from bank accounts, tax filings, medical records and phone numbers. The government would have unregulated access to such information -- and there is no statute to guard against abuse or to allow an individual to file a complaint.   Essentially, under the Aadhar project, a citizen's data now belongs to the Indian government and not to the individual. There are fears that the project would endow the Indian government with enormous knowledge that could be deployed against minority communities and individuals who disagree with its politics and policies.   Twenty-two petitioners have challenged the constitutionality of Aadhar. The lead petitioner, K. S. Puttaswamy, a 91-year-old retired judge, contested the requirement that people have an Aadhar number to obtain cooking gas and to purchase grains from the public distribution system.   The Aadhar case prompted the Supreme Court to assess whether Indians had privacy rights under their Constitution. Without a constitutional interest in privacy, there can be no right to protection of personal data. Now, with their jurisprudence on privacy, the justices have emerged as champions of personal liberties.   Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister and a leader in the struggle against British colonial rule, had spent substantial amounts of time in colonial courts and jails. As the Constituent Assembly of India was debating the making of the Constitution in the late 1940s, Nehru was skeptical about the role of the Supreme Court and feared that the judiciary would obstruct change.   To its credit, the Supreme Court of independent India became deeply invested in protecting marginalized individuals from the negligence of the government by establishing socio-economic rights like the right to food, education and livelihood and the right to a clean environment through a rather expansive appreciation of the right to life and liberty.   However, the court has been cautious when it comes to the rights of the individual confronted by an invasive state and a domineering society. Its judgment defining privacy as a fundamental right represents a tremendous change in direction.   In the ruling, the court envisaged the right to privacy as flowing through other crucial rights like equality, dignity, life, liberty, expression, association and speech.   The justices navigated privacy as a multifaceted right. They highlighted its contours through violations including forced feeding, lack of reproductive choices and telephone tapping.   They emphasized privacy as a necessary condition for ''seclusion,'' which in turn enables the exercise of freedoms like speech, expression and association.   The court also made clear that bodily integrity, informational privacy and privacy of personal choice is inextricably linked to democracy, dignity and fraternity, which are provided for by the Constitution.   This conception of privacy as illustrated by violations, as facilitating seclusion, and as enabling classical civil and political rights and linked to the larger political project of democracy and fraternity, is what makes the Supreme Court judgment such a watershed moment. The judges reminded India that ''the purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of majorities, whether legislative or popular.''   The court also cleansed its own institutional reputation by choosing constitutional morality over majoritarian morality. An 1860 colonial law that criminalized same-sex intimacy as ''unnatural sex'' stayed on the books in independent India. In 2012, the Delhi High Court annulled it, saying it violated the rights of L.G.B.T. Indians. A few months later, the Supreme Court overruled the High Court judgment and criminalized same-sex relations again.   In the privacy judgment, the justices of the Supreme Court tore apart the homophobia of their predecessors and castigated their reasoning. The court, though, stopped short of overruling its 2012 decision since it has yet to hear the curative petitions and constitutional challenge filed by L.G.B.T. Indians.   The judgment has also given legal and constitutional impetus to other issues before the court, including petitions arguing for criminalization of marital rape and challenges to beef bans. The jurisprudence of choice in personal and public life will be argued as a binding constitutional principle in these cases as well as the same-sex cases.   And the privacy ruling represents a remarkable shift in the Supreme Court from a reticent post-colonial court on matters of individual liberty to an erudite constitutional court safeguarding freedom in the terrifying times of new India. The court is showing that it will be the institution most responsible for India's enduring as a constitutional democracy.

Proposal to Collect Social Media Data From Immigrants Raises Privacy Concerns,"WASHINGTON -- The Department of Homeland Security will soon begin collecting social media data from all immigrants entering the United States, part of what agency officials call an effort to more effectively screen those coming to the country but privacy advocates see as an unnecessary intrusion that would do little to protect national security. The department will begin collecting the information on Oct. 18, the same day the Trump administration's new travel ban on citizens of seven countries and restrictions on those from two others are set to take effect.     Green card holders and naturalized citizens will also have their social media information collected, with the data becoming part of their immigration file. It was unclear whether the monitoring would take place only in the application process or could continue afterward.   The department published the new requirement in the Federal Register last week, saying it would collect ''social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results,'' which would be included in an applicant's immigration file. It said the data would come from ''publicly available information obtained from the internet, public records, public institutions, interviewees, commercial data providers.''   The data collection has alarmed privacy groups and lawyers, who expressed concerns on about how the department would use the information. Advocates say they also worry that the monitoring could suck in information on American citizens who communicate over social media with immigrants.   ''This would undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the free speech that's expressed every day on social media,'' Faiz Shakir, the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. ''This collect-it-all approach is ineffective to protect national security and is one more example of the Trump administration's anti-immigrant agenda.''   Efforts to collect social media information are not unique to the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, the department had begun asking visitors to voluntarily provide social media information, and had four pilot screening programs.   After the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., counterterrorism officials and lawmakers grew increasingly worried about the use of social media by terrorist groups like the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.   Many members of Congress, mainly Republicans, began urging the Department of Homeland Security to use data gleaned from visa applicants' or asylum seekers' social media accounts as part of the immigration process.   Congressional Democrats also supported the effort to collect social media data on visa applicants.   ''We believe these checks, focused on possible connections to terrorist activity, should be incorporated into D.H.S.'s vetting process for visa determinations, and that this policy should be implemented as soon as possible,'' Democratic lawmakers said in a letter at the time.   The attackers in San Bernardino, Tashfeen Malik and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, had exchanged private online messages discussing their commitment to jihad and martyrdom, law enforcement officials said. But they did not post any public messages about their plans on Facebook or other social media platforms.   One of the pilot projects, which began in December 2015, screened the social media accounts of applicants for so-called fiancé visas, the program under which Ms. Malik entered the United States.   United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the part of the Department of Homeland Security that approves citizenship and green cards, has previously used social media as part of the screening process for Syrian refugees, but only when the person was flagged because of a hit in an intelligence database or when questions were raised during an interview with immigration officials.   Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program at New York University, said although it was true that the Obama administration collected social media information, the new monitoring put in place by the Trump administration represented an escalation.   ''What is different here is that it appears that they are monitoring people who are already in the United States -- green card holders, for example,'' she said. ''And there is a lack of transparency of how they are using this data, which does heighten the concerns for this group of people.''

N.S.A. Is Granted More Latitude to Share Intercepted Communications,"Follow Charlie Savage on Twitter @charlie_savage. WASHINGTON -- In its final days, the Obama administration has expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government's 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections. The new rules significantly relax longstanding limits on what the N.S.A. may do with the information gathered by its most powerful surveillance operations, which are largely unregulated by American wiretapping laws. These include collecting satellite transmissions, phone calls and emails that cross network switches abroad, and messages between people abroad that cross domestic network switches.    The change means that far more officials will be searching through raw data. Essentially, the government is reducing the risk that the N.S.A. will fail to recognize that a piece of information would be valuable to another agency, but increasing the risk that officials will see private information about innocent people.    Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch signed the new rules, permitting the N.S.A. to disseminate ''raw signals intelligence information,'' on Jan. 3, after the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., signed them on Dec. 15, according to a 23-page, largely declassified copy of the procedures.   Previously, the N.S.A. filtered information before sharing intercepted communications with another agency, like the C.I.A. or the intelligence branches of the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The N.S.A.'s analysts passed on only information they deemed pertinent, screening out the identities of innocent people and irrelevant personal information.   Now, other intelligence agencies will be able to search directly through raw repositories of communications intercepted by the N.S.A. and then apply such rules for ''minimizing'' privacy intrusions.   ''This is not expanding the substantive ability of law enforcement to get access to signals intelligence,'' said Robert S. Litt, the general counsel to Mr. Clapper. ''It is simply widening the aperture for a larger number of analysts, who will be bound by the existing rules.''   But Patrick Toomey, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, called the move an erosion of rules intended to protect the privacy of Americans when their messages are caught by the N.S.A.'s powerful global collection methods. He noted that domestic internet data was often routed or stored abroad, where it may get vacuumed up without court oversight.   ''Rather than dramatically expanding government access to so much personal data, we need much stronger rules to protect the privacy of Americans,'' Mr. Toomey said. ''Seventeen different government agencies shouldn't be rooting through Americans' emails with family members, friends and colleagues, all without ever obtaining a warrant.''   The N.S.A. has been required to apply similar privacy protections to foreigners' information since early 2014, an unprecedented step that President Obama took after the disclosures of N.S.A. documents by the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden. The other intelligence agencies will now have to follow those rules, too.   Under the new system, agencies will ask the N.S.A. for access to specific surveillance feeds, making the case that they contain information relevant and useful to their missions. The N.S.A. will grant requests it deems reasonable after considering factors like whether large amounts of Americans' private information might be included and, if so, how damaging or embarrassing it would be if that information were ''improperly used or disclosed.''   The move is part of a broader trend of tearing down bureaucratic barriers to sharing intelligence between agencies that dates back to the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. In 2002, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court secretly began permitting the N.S.A., the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. to share raw intercepts gathered domestically under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   After Congress enacted the FISA Amendments Act -- which legalized warrantless surveillance on domestic soil so long as the target is a foreigner abroad, even when the target is communicating with an American -- the court permitted raw sharing of emails acquired under that program, too.   In July 2008, the same month Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act, President George W. Bush modified Executive Order 12333, which sets rules for surveillance that domestic wiretapping statutes do not address, including techniques that vacuum up vast amounts of content without targeting anybody.   After the revision, Executive Order 12333 said the N.S.A. could share the raw fruits of such surveillance after the director of national intelligence and the attorney general, coordinating with the defense secretary, agreed on procedures. It took another eight years to develop those rules.   The Times first reported the existence of those deliberations in 2014 and later filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for documents about them. It ended that case last February, and Mr. Litt discussed the efforts in an interview at that time, but declined to divulge certain important details because the rules were not yet final or public.   Among the most important questions left unanswered in February was when analysts would be permitted to use Americans' names, email addresses or other identifying information to search a 12333 database and pull up any messages to, from or about them that had been collected without a warrant.   There is a parallel debate about the FISA Amendments Act's warrantless surveillance program. National security analysts sometimes search that act's repository for Americans' information, as do F.B.I. agents working on ordinary criminal cases. Critics call this the ''backdoor search loophole,'' and some lawmakers want to require a warrant for such searches.   By contrast, the 12333 sharing procedures allow analysts, including those at the F.B.I., to search the raw data using an American's identifying information only for the purpose of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence investigations, not for ordinary criminal cases. And they may do so only if one of several other conditions are met, such as a finding that the American is an agent of a foreign power.   However, under the rules, if analysts stumble across evidence that an American has committed any crime, they will send it to the Justice Department.   The limits on using Americans' information gathered under Order 12333 do not apply to metadata: logs showing who contacted whom, but not what they said. Analysts at the intelligence agencies may study social links between people, in search of hidden associates of known suspects, ''without regard to the location or nationality of the communicants.''

Journalism or Propaganda? A Russian TV Network Blurs the Line,"Follow Steven Erlanger on Twitter @StevenErlanger . LONDON -- The London newsroom and studios of RT, the television channel and website formerly known as Russia Today, are ultramodern and spacious, with spectacular views from the 16th floor overlooking the Thames and the London Eye. And, its London bureau chief, Nikolay A. Bogachikhin, jokes, ''We overlook MI5 and we're near MI6,'' Britain's domestic and foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Bogachikhin was poking fun at the charge from Western governments, American and European, that RT is an agent of Kremlin policy and a tool directly used by President Vladimir V. Putin to undermine Western democracies -- meddling in the recent American presidential election and, European security officials say, trying to do the same in the Netherlands, France and Germany, all of which vote later this year.    But the West is not laughing. Even as Russia insists that RT is just another global network like the BBC or France 24, albeit one offering ''alternative views'' to the Western-dominated news media, many Western countries regard RT as the slickly produced heart of a broad, often covert disinformation campaign designed to sow doubt about democratic institutions and destabilize the West.    Western attention focused on RT when the Obama administration and United States intelligence agencies judged with ''high confidence'' in January that Mr. Putin had ordered a campaign to ''undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process,'' discredit Hillary Clinton through the hacking of Democratic Party internal emails and provide support for Donald J. Trump, who as a candidate said he wanted to improve relations with Russia.   The agencies issued a report saying the attack was carried out through the targeted use of real information, some open and some hacked, and the creation of false reports, or ''fake news,'' broadcast on state-funded news media like RT and its sibling, the internet news agency Sputnik. These reports were then amplified on social media, sometimes by computer ''bots'' that send out thousands of Facebook and Twitter messages.   To many Americans, the impression that RT is an instrument of Russian meddling was reinforced when its programming suddenly interrupted C-Span's online coverage of the House of Representatives in January. (C-Span later called it a technical error, not a hacking.)   Watching RT can be a dizzying experience. Hard news and top-notch graphics mix with interviews from all sorts of people: well known and obscure, left and right. They include favorites like Julian Assange of WikiLeaks and Noam Chomsky, the liberal critic of Western policies; odd voices like the actress Pamela Anderson; and cranks who think Washington is the source of all evil in the world.   But if there is any unifying character to RT, it is a deep skepticism of Western and American narratives of the world and a fundamental defensiveness about Russia and Mr. Putin.   Analysts are sharply divided about the influence of RT. Pointing to its minuscule ratings numbers, many caution against overstating its impact. Yet focusing on ratings may miss the point, says Peter Pomerantsev, who wrote a book three years ago that described Russia's use of television for propaganda. ''Ratings aren't the main thing for them,'' he said. ''These are campaigns for financial, political and media influence.''   RT and Sputnik propel those campaigns by helping create the fodder for thousands of fake news propagators and providing another outlet for hacked material that can serve Russian interests, said Ben Nimmo, who studies RT for the Atlantic Council.   Whatever its impact, RT is unquestionably a case study in the complexity of modern propaganda. It is both a slick modern television network, dressed up with great visuals and stylish presenters, and a content farm that helps feed the European far right. Viewers find it difficult to discern exactly what is journalism and what is propaganda, what may be ''fake news'' and what is real but presented with a strong slant.   A recent evening featured reports of Britain refusing to condemn human rights violations in Bahrain and a ''mainstream media firestorm'' over Attorney General Jeff Sessions's chats with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Other reports included the ''liberation'' of Palmyra by the Syrian Army with ''the support of the Russian Air Force;'' an interview with former British ambassador to Syria and a United States critic, Peter Ford; and a report about a London professor decrying the fall in British living standards.   There are ''clickbait'' videos on RT's website and stranger pieces, too, like one about a petition to ban the financier George Soros from America for supposedly trying to ''destabilize'' the country and ''drown it'' with immigrants for a ''globalist goal.''   Mr. Bogachikhin and Anna Belkina, RT's head of communications in Moscow, insist it is absurd to lump together RT's effort to provide ''alternative views to the mainstream media'' with the phenomena of fake news and social media propaganda.   ''There's an hysteria about RT,'' Ms. Belkina said. ''RT becomes a shorthand for everything.''   For example, she says, while RT was featured heavily in the American intelligence report, it was largely in a seven-page annex (of a 13-page report) that was written more than four years ago, in December 2012, a fact revealed only in a footnote on Page 6.   She flatly denies any suggestion that RT seeks to meddle in democratic elections anywhere. ''The kind of scrutiny we're under -- we check everything.''   For RT and its viewers, the outlet is a refreshing alternative to what they see as complacent Western elitism and neo-liberalism, representing what the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov recently called a ''post-West world order.''   With its slogan, created by a Western ad agency, of ''Question More,'' RT is trying to fill a niche, Ms. Belkina said. ''We want to complete the picture rather than add to the echo chamber of mainstream news; that's how we find an audience.''   Nearly all the mainstream media came out against Mr. Trump during the campaign and much of the news coverage about him was negative, she said.   ''This is why we exist,'' Ms. Belkina said. ''It's important to watch RT to hear alternative voices. You might not agree with them, but it's important to try to understand where they're coming from and why.''   A French legislator, Nicolas Dhuicq, who has appeared on RT and went to Russian-annexed Crimea in 2015 as part of a delegation of French legislators, said that RT's aim was ''to make the voice of Russia heard, to make the Russian point of view on the world heard.''   Still, Mr. Dhuicq said, ''the impact of RT, in my opinion, is very low.'' He added: ''There is enormous paranoia when we imagine that RT will change the face of the world, influence national or other elections.''   Afshin Rattansi, who hosts a talk show three times a week called ''Going Underground,'' came to RT in 2013 after working at the BBC, CNN, Bloomberg, Al Jazeera and Iran's Press TV. ''Unlike at the BBC and CNN, I was never told what to say at RT,'' he said. There have been two cases of RT announcers quitting because of what they said was pressure to toe a Kremlin line, especially on Ukraine, but not in London, Mr. Rattansi said.   Michael McFaul, a Stanford professor who was the United States ambassador to Russia during the Obama years, said that RT should not be lightly dismissed. ''There is a demand in certain countries for this alternative view, an appetite, and we arrogant Americans shouldn't just think that no one cares.''   But there is a considerably darker view, too. For critics, RT and Sputnik are simply tools of a sophisticated Russian propaganda machine, created by the Kremlin to push its foreign policy, defend its aggression in Ukraine and undermine confidence in democracy, NATO and the world as we have known it.   Robert Pszczel, who ran NATO's information office in Moscow and watches Russia and the western Balkans for NATO, said that RT and Sputnik were not meant for domestic consumption, unlike the BBC or CNN. Over time, he said, ''It's more about hard power and disinformation.''   The Kremlin doesn't care ''if you agree with Russian policy or think Putin is wonderful, so long as it does the job -- you start having doubts, and of 10 outrageous points you take on one or two,'' he said. ''A bit of mud will always stick.''   Probably more important than RT, Mr. Pszczel said, are Sputnik and local language outlets sponsored by Russia, like the Slovak magazine ''Zem a Vek,'' known for its conspiracy theories. Sputnik is the largest source of raw news in the Balkans, he said, ''because it's a free product in local languages.'' And ''then they set up some friendly association, at some small university, which holds seminars, and then a number of strange websites start promoting the product, like an industrial marketing operation.''   But RT is also helpful in another traditional Moscow effort: making friends with useful people, and not just Mr. Assange, Mr. Pomerantsev said. ''RT made Mike Flynn feel good after losing his job'' as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he said, paying him a reported $40,000 to come to RT's anniversary celebration in Moscow and sit near Mr. Putin. And Mr. Flynn, for a time, was national security adviser of the United States.   Mr. Nimmo of the Atlantic Council noted RT's small reach in Germany, where Angela Merkel, a Putin critic, is facing a tough re-election fight, and where there are up to 3.5 million Russian speakers. ''I strongly suspect that RT Deutsch has a trivial effect compared to Russian-speaking Germans watching Russian television,'' he said.   Stefan Meister, who studies Russia and Central Europe for the German Council on Foreign Relations, agreed that ''we shouldn't overestimate RT. The main success of the Russians is the link to social media through bots and a network of different sources.'' That network, he said, is ''increasingly well organized, with more strategic and explicit links between sources and actors -- Russian domestic media, troll factories, RT, people in social networks and maybe also the security services.''   ''Open societies are very vulnerable,'' Mr. Meister said, ''and it's cheaper than buying a new rocket.''   RT is part of the reality of the 21st century, Mr. Pomerantsev said. ''Everyone will do it soon. It's the world we have to live in.'' Hacks and leaks are much more disruptive, he said. ''If you can take out the electrical grid in Ukraine, that's scary. It's hard to get too scared about Larry King on RT.''   Mr. Pomerantsev agrees with Ms. Belkina that RT is not inventing popular mistrust about Western democracy. ''The Russians are about sowing mistrust about institutions that is there already, feeding it,'' he said. ''How do we make our institutions more trustworthy?''     "
Technologies That Will Rock Your World,"After the Russian hacking of the 2016 election, many people worry that technology has gone too far. And yet it continues to evolve rapidly. Largely because of the success of companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, investment in tech research continues to climb. At the same time, because of the sudden maturation of mathematical methods that can deliver what is commonly called artificial intelligence, the possibilities are expanding.    There is reason for concern, but also for optimism. The new wave of artificial intelligence will reduce jobs, but will also improve your health and products like your smartphone. Here are five areas where tech companies, large and small, will change the way we live.   A.I. Health Care    Over the last half decade, with help from the complex algorithms deep neural networks, computers have learned to see. Loosely based on the web of neurons in the human brain, a neural network can learn tasks by identifying patterns in vast amounts of data. By analyzing millions of bicycle photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to recognize a bicycle.   This means that services like Facebook and Google Photos can instantly recognize faces and objects in images uploaded to the internet. But artificial intelligence will also lead to a revolution in health care. Using these same techniques, machines can also learn to identify signs of disease and illness in medical scans. By analyzing millions of retinal photos, a neural network can learn to recognize early signs of diabetic blindness. By analyzing CT scans, a neural network can learn to spot lung cancer.   Such technology will improve health care in places where doctors are scarce. But eventually, it will streamline care in the developed world as well. Google is already running tests inside two hospitals in India, and the start-up Infervision has deployed similar technology in hospitals across China.   In the longer term, similar methods promise to rapidly accelerate drug discovery and so many other aspects of health care. ''Everything from the nature of the food that we grow and eat to the drugs that we give ourselves to how we monitor the impact of these things is all being transformed by A.I. in deeply profound ways,'' said Matt Ocko, a managing partner at DCVC, a San Francisco venture capital firm that has invested heavily in this area.   Conversational Computing   Neural networks are not limited to image recognition. Far from it. These same techniques are rapidly improving coffee-table gadgets like the Amazon Echo, which can recognize spoken commands from across the room, and online services like Skype, which can instantly translate phone calls from one language to another. They may even eventually produce machines that can carry on a conversation.   Recently, said Luke Zettlemoyer, a University of Washington professor, there has been a ''huge phase shift'' in the area of natural language understanding -- technology that understands the natural way people talk and write. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are at the forefront of this movement, which promises to fundamentally change how we interact with phones, cars, and potentially any machine. Many companies are moving down the same path, including Replika, a San Francisco start-up.   With help from machine learning, Replika offers a smartphone ''chatbot'' that acts as a kind of personal confidante, chatting with you in moments when no one else is around. But the hope is that these techniques will improve to where they serve you in so many other ways. What if Alexa was truly conversational, if you could have a back and forth dialogue? Right now, it is about basic questions and commands. Today, it ''recognizes'' words very very well. But truly ''understanding'' complex English sentences is beyond machines at this point. What if machines could carry on a dialogue like Hal in 2001?   Mind Control   Some people argue there are even better ways of interacting with computers by using brain waves. Rather than telling a computer what you want, many companies say they believe you could just think it.   Using electroencephalography, or EEG -- a longstanding means of measuring electrical brain activity from sensors placed on the head -- the start-up Neurable is building a virtual reality game that can be played with the mind. EEG is limited for this kind of use, but other researchers, including at Facebook, aim to build a far more powerful systems using optical sensors. Facebook hopes that, in a few years, this technology will let people type with their minds five times faster than they can with a smartphone keyboard.   These techniques will also face physical limits, and that may bar the way to Facebook's goal. But various start-ups, including Neuralink, founded by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, are going several steps further, hoping to read brain activity from chips implanted inside the skull. At first, they will limit this technology to people with disabilities. But ultimately, Mr. Musk and others hope to also implant chips in healthy people.   ''It is implausible that this technology would go straight into healthy people,'' said Ed Boyden, an M.I.T. neuroscientist who is also an adviser to Neuralink. ''But there is a natural trajectory where, if a medical technology proves effective, it can move into normal individuals as well.''   The Flying Car   Want more science fiction in your everyday reality? As entrepreneurs like Mr. Musk work to put a chip in your head, others are working to put cars in the skies.   Even as he sets the pace in the race to autonomous cars, Larry Page, the chief executive of Alphabet and a founder of Google, is backing Kitty Hawk, a start-up that wants to move commuting into the air. And many others, including the start-up Joby Aviation, Uber and Airbus, are working on vehicles capable of flying above congested roads. These vehicles take many forms, but generally, they carry a single rider and take off like a helicopter: straight up.   At first, Kitty Hawk will sell its vehicles to hobbyists. But the company hopes it can eventually convince the general public, and regulators, that flying cars make sense. That is no easy task. After all, these cars will require a new kind of air traffic control.   The Quantum Computer   Even more outlandish? It's the prospect of a quantum computer. Drawing on the seemingly magical properties of quantum physics, such a machine would be exponentially more powerful than computers of today. Think of it this way: A quantum computer could instantly crack the encryption that protects the world's most private data.   The problem is that these machines are enormously difficult to build. but progress has accelerated. Google, IBM and Intel are investing heavily in this push, as are start-ups like Rigetti Computing.   Researchers say they believe that quantum machines eventually could accelerate drug discovery, streamline financial markets, solve traffic problems and more.   ''It is a completely different paradigm for processing information,'' said Robert Schoelkopf, who helped invent the techniques that are driving so much of quantum computing research.

Many online spaces offer some form of death planning. But this is still a relatively new concept, and some popular destinations on the internet don't give users a way to plan for their death. In that case, it's best to establish a plan now with a trusted loved one. For the websites and services that offer help, here's what to know.     FACEBOOK   Whom do you trust to mind your central online presence after your death? That person should probably be your Facebook legacy contact. This person will be able to write a post that will remain at the top of your profile and update your profile photo. You can also allow that person to download an archive of your public activity (including posts, photos and ''likes'').   Alternatively, you can set your account to delete everything once Facebook is notified of your death.   GOOGLE   Google lets you choose up to 10 people to be the executors of your account once you die or your account becomes inactive via its inactive account manager feature. To set this up, choose an amount of time between sign-ins for your account to be designated ''inactive.'' Once that threshold is met (for example, you don't sign into any Google service for a certain number of months), your chosen contact will get a prewritten email from you with your wishes for your account.   ONLINE DATA BACKUP SERVICES   Online data storage is an especially tricky part of death planning. The industrywide push for privacy and encryption, while great for personal protection, has created problems. ''There's a very real security and privacy implication that can somewhat conflict'' with online death planning, said Ahin Thomas, the vice president for marketing for Backblaze, an online backup service. ''If you set up a private encryption key -- we're not joking -- we don't have access.''   So what can you do? The best advice, Mr. Thomas said, is to simply give the keys to your data to someone you trust.   For more life tips, look for Smarter Living on nytimes.com.     "
Uber Executive's Lawyers Say He May Face Charges,"SAN FRANCISCO -- An Uber executive accused of stealing driverless car technology from his former employers at Google is exercising his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, according to his lawyers. The lawyers for Anthony Levandowski, the former head of Google's self-driving car project who is now leading a similar effort at Uber, said he was broadly asserting his Fifth Amendment rights because there was ''potential for criminal action'' in the case, according to court transcripts obtained on Thursday.    The legal maneuver adds even more intrigue to the high-profile fight between two of the technology industry's largest companies, which are squaring off in the race to put driverless cars on the road.    Mr. Levandowski is at the center of a lawsuit between Uber and Waymo, which was spun out from Google to become its own Alphabet subsidiary. Waymo has accused Mr. Levandowski of stealing documents and poaching employees before quitting Google and then colluding with Uber to use that technology to advance driverless car efforts at the ride-hailing service.   Shortly after leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski started his own self-driving truck start-up, Otto. Six months after Otto was formed, Uber acquired the company for $680 million. Waymo filed a motion seeking a temporary injunction this month to stop Uber's autonomous vehicle development.   As part of the motion seeking the injunction, Waymo said that Mr. Levandowski, while still working at Google, installed software that allowed him to download over 14,000 files, or about 9.7 gigabytes of data, pertaining to the driverless car program. Uber was ordered to hand over those files.   In the transcript of a private hearing before Judge William Alsup in United States District Court in San Francisco, Mr. Levandowski's lawyers said he was invoking his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination in not turning over documents that may pertain to the case. Arturo Gonzalez, one of Uber's lawyers, said they have made clear to Mr. Levandowski that he needs to release any documents relevant to the case as part of discovery. ''We obviously have a conflict,'' he said.   Miles Ehrlich, one of the lawyers representing Mr. Levandowski, said the Uber executive was asserting his Fifth Amendment rights to protect against ''compelled disclosure that would identify the existence, location or possession of any responsive documents.'' He also said that Mr. Levandowski's decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment may change as they examine the case.   The situation raises questions about the future of Mr. Levandowski at the company. When Uber's lawyer told the court that the company could not force him to testify, Judge Alsup said Uber had the right to order him to cooperate or be fired.   Without arguing about whether or not Mr. Levandowski stole documents, Uber's lawyer said the company intended to prove that its driverless car technology was not stolen from Waymo.   ''The more we get into this, it might look like a public relations disaster for Uber,'' said Michael Carrier, a law professor at Rutgers University. ''The mere fact that you're pleading the Fifth doesn't look good.''   The acquisition of Otto and the hiring of Mr. Levandowski was critical for Uber. It is betting that autonomous cars are essential to its future, allowing it to run a fleet of cars around the clock without having to pay drivers.   Angela Padilla, Uber's associate general counsel, said in a statement that the company plans to publicly lay out its case on April 7. ''We are very confident that Waymo's claims against Uber are baseless and that Anthony Levandowski has not used any files from Google in his work with Otto or Uber,'' she said. A Waymo spokesman declined to comment.   Uber's lawyers tried to keep the hearing confidential, arguing that it could harm Mr. Levandowski's reputation. Judge Alsup dismissed that argument.   The New York Times obtained a copy of the transcript after Uber sent an email to employees warning of possible negative coverage in the news media over the expected release of a document from the trial.

Why People Persist in Risky Trading,"After all the publicity about insider trading the last few years, with headline cases and substantial prison terms meted out to defendants, you might think that people would not try it -- or at least do a better job hiding it. Yet, two cases filed last week appear to show that some defendants are not doing much to keep questionable trading under wraps. That raises the question of whether the allure of easy profits is so strong that it overpowers any inclination to follow the rules, and whether the hefty punishments handed out in the past few years have had little appreciable deterrent effect.    A Florida lawyer, Walter C. Little, is accused in a criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan of trading on confidential information about clients of his former firm, Foley & Lardner, where he was a partner until July 2016. He is also charged with tipping a neighbor, Andrew M. Berke, also named as a defendant, resulting in more than $1 million in profits for the two men.   The complaint alleges that Mr. Little obtained information through the law firm's document management system, which recorded the dates and times when a user viewed a file. The documents Mr. Little viewed were merger agreements, corporate earnings and other government filings for seven clients of the firm, none of whom he represented.    The law firm's system gives a virtual road map to when the government believes Mr. Little got the information and then he and Mr. Berke traded stock and options in brokerage accounts in their own names.   Mr. Berke gave Mr. Little three checks totaling $93,000 in 2016. A notation on the front of two checks indicated they were payments for legal fees, although a partner would typically put funds into the law firm's client trust account. The money may help establish the quid pro quo arrangement needed to prove illegal tipping.   A lawyer for Mr. Little states that his client ''maintains his innocence.''   We have seen lawyers stealing client information to trade despite clear ethical rules for the profession that prohibit using client information for personal gain. For example, Matthew Kluger received a 12-year prison term for taking information about client mergers and acquisitions in a long-running scheme to trade on inside information that resulted in nearly $37 million in profits.   When the line is crossed to stealing information, we would expect that there would be some effort to hide the conduct. Mr. Kluger and his co-conspirators were able to hide their trading for years, until one got greedy and came to the attention of the authorities.   Those more elaborate methods were used to hide the conduct, but Mr. Little appears to have left a paper trail by trading in an account in his own name and accessing information in a system that tracks who views a document and when.   There have been cases in which defendants used disposable cellphones to try to cover their tracks, such as that of the recently convicted of William T. Walters, in which a ''Bat Phone'' was used to communicate with a corporate insider. Giving a nickname to your phone is not much of a cover, and maybe it is just that white-collar criminals are not very good at engaging in misconduct because they fail to go to greater lengths to keep from being discovered.   The criminal complaint describes a strong circumstantial case against Mr. Little and Mr. Berke, although at this point we have only the government's side of the story. Perhaps the minimal efforts to hide the trading and access to client information show that the defendants did not believe they were engaging in anything illegal, a potential defense based on the lack of intent.   In the second case, a former accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, David Humphrey, pleaded guilty to making a false statement on ethics forms filed with the agency about his trading in options.   S.E.C. rules impose substantial limits on trading by its employees, including restrictions on transactions in the securities of financial institutions directly regulated by the agency along with trading derivatives.   Mr. Humphrey acknowledged that he failed to disclose options trading from 2001 to 2014 without getting the required approval, and subsequently not disclosing the assets he acquired in an annual report. He compounded the problem by denying any violation of the trading and reporting rules when confronted during an investigation by the S.E.C.'s inspector general.   Despite the clarity of the trading restrictions for S.E.C. employees, Mr. Humphrey made trades from his computer at the S.E.C., and used accounts in the name of his ex-wife and later in a joint account with his second wife. He even traded options in his mother's account, something that would seem to stick out like a sore thumb once investigators started looking at him.   In a rare step of suing one of its own former employees, the S.E.C. filed civil securities fraud charges, which Mr. Humphrey settled by paying more than $100,000 in disgorgement of profits and a civil penalty. What makes that charge a bit odd is that he did not defraud anyone in the market, nor did he misuse confidential information in his trading, so the only real victim in the case was the S.E.C. by having its reputation damaged.   Prosecutors often argue that defendants bend the rules so that they can generate risk-free profits. The former major league baseball player Doug DeCinces was convicted last week of insider trading in advance of a merger that netted him approximately $1.3 million. The prosecutor told jurors in a closing statement that the defendants ''won because they knew tomorrow's news today.''   That explains how a defendant broke the law, but it does not answer the question of why he did it. If the charges against Mr. Little are true, then he violated a basic precept of the legal profession by misusing the confidential information of a client. He made about $350,000 on his trades, which hardly seems worth the possibility of serving a prison term and giving up a successful legal career.   Mr. Humphrey had retired from the S.E.C., but whatever reputation he might have had along with the prospect of using that experience to work as an accountant have now been destroyed by engaging in a small-scale options-trading strategy to make about $50,000 over more than a decade.   Greed is often offered as the motive for white-collar crimes, but the amounts involved in cases like these do not seem to reflect any kind of extreme avarice that would lead someone to risk an entire career and reputation.   Perhaps a better explanation is hubris, that a measure of arrogance drives individuals to ignore clear rules in the mistaken belief that they will not get caught because they are smarter than everyone else -- or, at least, smarter than those who have gotten caught in the past.   Deterrence works when a person makes a rational calculation of the potential costs and benefits of a course of action. If you believe you are better than the rules, however, then hefty punishments do little to deter a course of conduct that, in hindsight, ends up being easily detected and quite costly.     "
Swedish Government Scrambles to Contain Damage From Data Breach,"STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's government is scrambling to contain the political fallout from a huge breach of confidential data, including the possible disclosure of the identities of undercover operatives, under the watch of a government contractor. The breach was disclosed this month by the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter, when it reported that Maria Agren, the former director general of the Swedish Transport Agency, had been fired in January for negligent handling of classified data.    The agency entered into an outsourcing agreement with IBM Sweden in April 2015, worth nearly $100 million, to manage vehicle registration and driver's license databases.    But adequate safeguards were not adopted, and as a result, unauthorized personnel at IBM subsidiaries in Eastern Europe had access to vast troves of sensitive information, including details about bridges, roads, ports, the subway system in Stockholm and other infrastructure.   In addition, the identities of people working undercover for the Swedish police and the Swedish security service, known as Sapo, may have been revealed, along with names of people working undercover for the special intelligence unit of the Swedish armed forces.   Unlike other cases involving breaches of government data, the case in Sweden does not appear to involve hacking or other malice. Instead, the focus has been on an apparent absence of proper safeguards and oversight.   On Monday, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven called the breach of information ''a total breakdown.'' He said: ''It is incredibly serious. It is a violation of the law and put Sweden and its citizens in harm's way.''   Anders Thornberg, head of the Swedish Security Service, told journalists: ''This is very serious because it could damage our operational business that we are conducting every day in order to protect Sweden.''   Members of Parliament have not been satisfied by those assurances. On Tuesday, they interviewed Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist and Interior Minister Anders Ygeman behind closed doors, asking why Mr. Lofven was only informed of the breach in January, at least 10 months after they became aware of it.   The scandal could throw the government, which is dominated by Mr. Lofven's center-left Social Democrats, into turmoil. In a phone interview, Anna Kinberg Batra, the leader of the opposition Moderate Party, said a no-confidence vote in one or more ministers was possible.   ''They have failed to communicate among themselves and to the prime minister, to the opposition and to the Swedish people,'' she said.   ''I think the public needs to know if our national security is jeopardized or not. In my mind the minister must swiftly inform the prime minister, who apparently hadn't heard of this until this year. That is really the essence of the crisis of confidence.''   According to the results of a preliminary investigation that began in January 2016, at least three unauthorized people in the Czech Republic had full access to the databases, meaning that they could copy the information and erase their electronic footprints.   The new director general of the transport agency, Jonas Bjelfvenstam, has said it will take until this fall to secure the leaked information.   Sapo urged in November 2015 that the outsourcing deal be stopped, but its recommendation was not followed, according to Dagens Nyheter.   Ms. Agren, the fired head of the transport agency, was fined $8,500 last month for being careless with sensitive information and sidestepping laws designed to protect security, privacy and details surrounding personal identity data.   Bengt Erik Angerfelt, a retired cybersecurity expert who worked with I.T. security and internet crime for the Swedish police, Sapo and Interpol, said he was not surprised by the scandal given pressures to cut costs and the ever-increasing complexity of a connected world.   ''One is trying to do things as cheaply as possible and it's expensive to hire your own personnel,'' he said in a phone interview. ''To do security checks on personnel in other countries is difficult.''   The head of information technology at the transport agency admitted to Sapo, the security service, that ''the keys to the kingdom'' had been given away, Dagens Nyheter reported on July 14, citing the preliminary investigation report by Sapo.   The transport agency manages millions of personal records and data about the infrastructure of the country's defense. Anyone with a driver's license, and toll-paying motorists in Stockholm, are registered, as are pilots, train conductors and air traffic controllers.   Through this information it is also possible to trace people with protected identities, armored vehicles, missing vehicles as well as where and when the transport of valuables and money are scheduled, Dagens Nyheter reported.   Ms. Agren's sidestepping of the laws meant IBM Sweden had free rein to give access to people who had not received security clearance, it reported. It said that the project manager for the outsourcing agreement admitted during questioning that ''he had no knowledge whatsoever of how to ensure security.''   IBM Sweden could not be immediately reached for comment.     "
Let People Sue Companies,"Richard Cordray is the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Washington -- When a data breach at Home Depot in 2014 led to losses for banks nationwide, a group of banks filed a class-action lawsuit seeking compensation. Companies have the choice of taking legal action together. Yet consumers are frequently blocked from exercising the same legal right when they believe that companies have wronged them. That's because many contracts for products like credit cards and bank accounts have mandatory arbitration clauses that prevent consumers from joining group lawsuits, forcing them to go it alone. For example, a group lawsuit against Wells Fargo for secretly opening phony bank accounts was blocked by arbitration clauses that pushed individual consumers into closed-door proceedings.     In 2010, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which I direct, was authorized to study mandatory arbitration and write rules consistent with the study. After five years of work, we recently finalized a rule to stop companies from denying groups of consumers the option of going to court when they are treated unfairly.   Opponents have unleashed attacks to overturn the rule, and the House just passed legislation to that end. Before the Senate decides whether to protect companies or consumers, it's worth correcting the record.   First, opponents claim that plaintiffs are better served by acting individually than by joining a group lawsuit. This claim is not supported by facts or common sense. Our study contained revealing data on the results of group lawsuits and individual actions. We found that group lawsuits get more money back to more people. In five years of group lawsuits, we tallied an average of $220 million paid to 6.8 million consumers per year. Yet in the arbitration cases we studied, on average, 16 people per year recovered less than $100,000 total.   It is true that the average payouts are higher in individual suits. But that is because very few people go through arbitration, and they generally do so only when thousands of dollars are at stake, whereas the typical group lawsuit seeks to recover small amounts for many people. Almost nobody spends time or money fighting a small fee on their own. As one judge noted, ''only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.''   When a bank charges illegal fees to millions of customers and then blocks them from suing together, a result is not millions of individual claims, but zero. So the bank gets to pocket millions in ill-gotten gains.   Not only do group lawsuits help consumers recover money they otherwise would forfeit, but they also protect many more consumers by halting and deterring harmful behavior. For example, when banks reordered bank debits to charge more overdraft fees, consumers sued and recovered $1 billion. Most banks have since stopped the practice.   Our rule does not ban individual arbitration, as our opponents falsely claim. It simply ensures that consumers have the option of joining together to sue companies. Companies and consumers can still use arbitration to resolve their differences, but companies cannot unilaterally block group lawsuits.   Opponents also claim that the rule benefits lawyers rather than consumers. In reality, lawyers collect a small portion compared with consumers, and only if they succeed. For every $10 that a company pays out for wrongdoing, we found about $8 goes to consumers and $2 goes to pay legal costs. In any event, banks choose to hire lawyers to file class-action lawsuits, and ordinary people deserve to make the same choice.   Finally, this rule does not risk the safety or soundness of the banking system. We estimate the potential costs of this rule for the entire financial system at under $1 billion per year, whereas banks alone made $171 billion in profits last year. The law already bans mandatory arbitration clauses in financial contracts for military service members and in mortgages (the largest consumer financial market), yet the financial sector remains strong.   In truth, by blocking group lawsuits, mandatory arbitration clauses eliminate a powerful means to get justice when a little harm happens to a lot of people. It is the height of hypocrisy for companies to say they're helping consumers by closing off the very same legal option they use when they've been wronged.   A cherished tenet of our justice system is that nobody should escape accountability for breaking the law. Our rule restores consumers' legal right to stand up for themselves and have their day in court without having to wait on the government to act. That is an idea everyone should support.

"Hack Will Lead to Little, if Any, Punishment for Equifax","It's a bad week when one senator says that ''somebody needs to go to jail'' for selling shares in your company before it disclosed a massive data breach, and another asserts that the episode was ''one of the most egregious examples of corporate malfeasances since Enron.'' The hacking into Equifax's trove of consumer and financial data that exposed the sensitive personal information of as many as 143 million Americans leads naturally to the question of the legal consequences the company and its executives might face. The answer, for those who remember the government's response to the financial crisis, will be as familiar as it is unwelcome: not much.    That seems outrageous when so many individuals may see their identities stolen because of a company's failure to ensure the safety of its primary product. But Equifax operates in a sphere with minimal government regulation, and its conduct is unlikely to trigger a criminal prosecution of the company or any of its executives.    The worst anyone connected with Equifax may end up facing is a tongue-lashing from Congress -- many hearings are already scheduled -- except for the outside chance that the aggrieved public gets its own day in court. But that could be years from now.   Unlike the banks that packaged and sold risky securities and derivatives, leading to the meltdown in the financial markets nine years ago, Equifax is a victim, not a perpetrator. Frustrating as it may be in this case, we usually don't blame the victim of a theft for allowing it to happen -- even if you go into a bad neighborhood late at night. And the usual tools that federal prosecutors use to go after companies for misconduct -- most notably the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes -- do not apply because Equifax did not actively mislead anyone about the hacking.   Although the company was accused of ''malfeasances'' (by Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York), it appears more likely that it was a matter of nonfeasance: Equifax did not properly install a security patch to open-source software it had used, even though it was available weeks before the hackers exploited the flaw.   That failure may well have been negligent, but that level of intent is rarely the basis for prosecuting white-collar offenses. Negligence is used regularly only in federal criminal prosecutions for food and drug safety problems and environmental contaminations.   The claim that someone needs to be put in jail (by Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota) was related to stock sales by three Equifax executives, including the chief financial officer, on Aug. 1, just a few days after the company became aware of the security breach. The Justice Department confirmed that it is investigating for possible criminal insider trading, but it is unclear what any of the executives knew about the hacking when they sold the shares.   Although the timing of the stock sales certainly looks suspicious, it may be that the executives did not know the extent or severity of the hacking, and therefore did not trade on material nonpublic information, a central requirement for pursuing a case.   On the regulatory side, Equifax and its two main competitors, TransUnion and Experian, come within the purview of the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But the likelihood of significant civil penalties for Equifax for any violations is small, and perhaps nonexistent. The F.T.C., which broke with tradition by publicly confirming that it had launched an investigation of Equifax, cannot hit companies with heavy fines, at least for a first offense. And the C.F.P.B. has limited power to impose penalties because it deals primarily with misleading information or products provided to consumers.   A number of state attorneys general have opened investigations into the hacking, and Massachusetts filed a lawsuit seeking civil penalties from Equifax for not protecting sensitive information. These types of claims are often limited to the actual harm caused to consumers in a state, something that might take months or years to manifest.   Equifax is a publicly traded company, so the Securities and Exchange Commission could investigate whether it had improperly delayed disclosing the security breach by waiting almost six weeks before informing the public. The rules for when a company must disclose material information are imprecise at best, however, and the company's efforts to identify the scope of the breach may give it some cover. So the delay, while frustrating to those put at risk, might not violate securities laws.   Even if regulators pursue a civil enforcement action against the company, Equifax executives and directors will probably escape any claims against them. Bank executives and directors can be suspended or removed from their positions for unsafe and unsound practices, but the credit bureaus are not subject to those regulations despite the crucial role they play in the financial system.   Equifax has an incentive compensation clawback policy that allows the company to reclaim bonuses and other awards to management, but it applies only ''in the event of a material restatement of the company's financial results.'' The hacking did not involve any financial misstatement, and even if the company could reclaim compensation, any amount would likely be minuscule, given that the breach took place only over several weeks.   The data breach appears to have cost two executives their jobs when Equifax announced on Friday that its chief information officer and chief security officer were retiring immediately. They will not lose any of their past compensation, and should get to enjoy the benefits accrued from their tenure in senior management.   With executives at Equifax unlikely to face criminal charges and regulators largely handcuffed, civil remedies may be the only avenue for redress.   Equifax shareholders have paid a steep price; the company's stock has lost over one-third of its value. But they are unlikely to win a claim for damages for breach of the corporate duty of due care unless there was a complete breakdown in how the company operated that allowed for the hacking.   Equifax is incorporated in Georgia, and the Georgia Supreme Court explained in  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v. Loudermilk that directors and management are not liable for damages unless they acted ''without deliberation, without the requisite diligence to ascertain and assess the facts and circumstances upon which the decisions are based, or in bad faith.''   The last glimmer of hope, then, may be a class-action lawsuit against Equifax for violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act, claiming that the company failed to safeguard consumer records. Unlike other consumer complaints, the law allows for punitive damages against a company for a violation, along with any actual damages and attorney's fees, potentially exposing Equifax to a significant award.   Dozens of class-action lawsuits, all seeking punitive damages, have been filed against the company for failing to protect consumer information. The usual procedure is to consolidate the complaints filed across the country before one federal district judge to conduct the preliminary proceedings, which itself can take months to sort out as the lawyers for the plaintiffs fight over who gets to lead the litigation.   Equifax faces a tidal wave of claims, but none will see the inside of a courtroom for months, if not years, especially if the company successfully argues that the claims must be pursued individually rather than as a class action. We can expect a settlement at some point once the preliminary issues are resolved, but even if the total sum tops $1 billion, that might mean individual recoveries of just a few dollars each.   There may be some solace here: The same day that Equifax disclosed the breach, Sept. 7, a House Financial Services subcommittee held a hearing on the F.C.R.A. Liability Harmonization Act, which would preclude punitive damages for violating the statute, a bill the company supported. The chances of the legislation's passing in light of the hacking appear to be negligible now.   But those looking for some type of criminal prosecution -- or even just a regulatory penalty -- for the company and its executives will probably be sorely disappointed.     "
Get Rid of Equifax,"Bryce Covert is a contributor at The Nation and a contributing opinion writer. Because of lax security at Equifax, one of the three major credit reporting companies, the private financial and personal details of as many as 143 million Americans have been exposed to hackers. We still don't know what the full ramifications will be; the people who took this information -- which includes birth dates, Social Security numbers and addresses -- could hold on to it for as long as they want and deploy it in years to come. Many consumers have scrambled to try to protect themselves. To anyone who tried to get through to Equifax customer service, though, it became clear: The company does not care about us. Months before the hack itself, Equifax could easily have patched the hole in its system that hackers exploited, but it simply didn't.     That's because we are not the customers of credit reporting companies, but the product. These private institutions hoover up our data, often without our knowledge and consent, and then sell it off to banks, landlords and even prospective employers. The companies rake in some $10 billion in revenue every year. They wield enormous power to ruin our lives -- if not through a data breach, then through errors on our credit reports. One in four consumers has an error on his credit report that could affect his scores, yet it can be very difficult to correct the record.   Although they call themselves bureaus, there is nothing governmental about what these private companies do. We let them take on a role that can have outsize consequences. And the free market doesn't work here, because none of us can refuse to be a part of this system and opt out if we don't like how we're being treated. There's no legal right to ask Equifax to remove your data from its registries or to stop it from getting more in the future.   Why should we continue to allow private companies to make money from us while ignoring our needs? Let's nationalize Equifax and the other two major credit reporting companies, Experian and TransUnion. We could follow other countries' example and hand the duty of tracking our financial histories over to a public registry instead of a private profiteer.   Equifax is the oldest of the Big Three credit reporting bureaus, and it got its start as a private investigator in the late 1800s. A client -- a business or a bank -- would ask it about a consumer, and it would go about digging up dirt on things like marital problems and convictions. That client would then pay it for its services.   This questionable business model raised eyebrows in the 1960s, when the companies were still compiling information on people's ''moral character'' such as affairs or drinking problems. At the time, the reports weren't available at all to the subjects themselves. That changed with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which was signed in 1970. But even that reform put virtually no oversight on the bureaus' practices.   Things haven't changed all that much. Those who want to dig up dirt via a credit report pay one of the Big Three companies and voilà, they have a dossier of financial information.   The first step toward fixing this mess would be to limit who can use these reports and reduce how influential they have become. Credit reporting companies have experienced quite the mission creep over recent years. In 2010, 60 percent of employers used credit reports to evaluate potential hires. That means that a report that workers have no control over and frequently don't even get a chance to see, which can have at least one error, is helping determine whether or not they get a job.   There's no good reason for employers to use this information -- credit reports haven't been shown to predict employee performance. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts agrees, and just reintroduced a bill that would bar employers from asking for credit histories.   But even such a crackdown wouldn't fully get rid of the danger the credit reporting business model poses to people's financial lives. Instead, given how poorly they operate and how little incentive their business model gives them to improve, their duties should be handed over to public institutions.   In at least 40 other countries -- including Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain -- credit reporting can be done by a public credit registry. It is usually operated by a central bank that already oversees the financial institutions that feed information into the reports. These reports tend to be more accurate because the operators have a legal right to demand data from banks as well as a mandate to ensure it's correct and that errors are fixed. Data on late payments and defaults are erased once a consumer has settled up.   Many of these public registries leave out things like medical debt, tax information and personal details like marital status, focusing only on loan amounts. Only about 40 percent of registries collect consumers' addresses, and two-thirds collect taxpayer IDs -- the kind of information leaked in the Equifax breach.   The United States government is, of course, not impervious to data breaches, nor does it have a perfect track record of fending them off. In 2015, it announced that hackers had stolen ''sensitive information'' on 21.5 million people. But the government is at least accountable to public pressure.

Huge Equifax Data Breach Takes a Bite Out of Profits,"Equifax has incurred $87.5 million of expenses stemming from a giant data breach  this year and faces dozens of government investigations as a result, the credit reporting company said Thursday.  Equifax disclosed in September that attackers had used a flaw in its website software to extract the personal information of as many as 145.5 million Americans. The stolen data included names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver's license numbers.    The company has been reeling ever since. Equifax said Thursday that its third-quarter profits fell to $96.3 million, down 27 percent from the same period last year.   Skittish corporate customers have delayed some projects until the company can prove that its systems are secure, Equifax said in a regulatory filing Thursday. Many have asked for security audits, the company said.   While Equifax's third-quarter sales increased slightly, to $834.8 million, they fell short of analysts' expectations.   ''We recognize that we have an important journey in front of us to regain the trust and confidence of consumers and our business customers,'' Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., the company's interim chief executive, said in a statement.   Mr. Barros was appointed when his predecessor, Richard F. Smith, left the company after the breach.   Equifax said it was facing more than 240 lawsuits seeking class action status, as well as investigations from a plethora of regulatory and law enforcement agencies. All 50 state attorneys general have demanded information, Equifax said, as have the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission and regulators in Britain and Canada.   Officials from the S.E.C. and the United States attorney's office in Atlanta, where Equifax has its headquarters, have begun investigating stock sales by several Equifax executives in the days after the breach was detected by the company, but before it was publicly revealed -- an announcement that sent Equifax shares plunging. Equifax said last week that its internal investigation of the trades had turned up no evidence of wrongdoing.   Equifax said it could not estimate the future expenses of dealing with the breach's fallout, but they are expected to be ''significant.''   The company's business of selling products and services directly to consumers will take the biggest hit, Equifax said, because it has stopped advertising for new business and is offering free credit monitoring for all American consumers.   But one of Equifax's fastest-growing businesses -- selling employment and payroll data that it has collected on millions of American workers -- seemed to have emerged relatively unscathed. Revenue for that unit rose 9 percent in the latest quarter, to $186.4 million.   Equifax said it was still conducting an internal review of the security breach. The examination has already uncovered ''two significant deficiencies'' in the company's technology systems that are being remediated, the company said.     "
"SoftBank Takes Steps to Acquire a Large Stake in Uber, but at a Sizable Discount","Follow Mike Isaac and Katie Benner on Twitter: @MikeIsaac and @ktbenner. SAN FRANCISCO -- SoftBank formally started its process for buying a significant stake in Uber with an offer to purchase some shares at a valuation of $48 billion, far below the nearly $70 billion valuation that the ride-hailing company garnered in its last round of fund-raising, according to two people briefed on the matter, who asked to remain anonymous because the process is confidential.  The price is an opening bid in what is known as a tender offer, in which a company makes a public offer to purchase stock from existing shareholders. The tender offer will take weeks to complete, and the price for Uber is likely to fluctuate until the process is complete.    Yet any discount will be a comedown for Uber, which is the most highly valued private company in the world. The ride-hailing service has been making plans to go public by 2019, and investors are intensely interested in whether Uber can maintain a high valuation before it stages an initial public offering.   The tender offer could not have come at a worse time for Uber, which has been rocked by a series of scandals and a leadership change this year. Last week, Uber also disclosed that it had covered up a security breach that had compromised the personal data of 57 million rider and driver accounts.   That revelation has angered regulators and lawmakers around the world. At least three lawsuits related to the data breach have been filed against Uber. On Monday, Uber faced a joint suit filed by Illinois and Chicago over the data breach. Lawmakers have also sent letters to Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, questioning the company about the hacking. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, has publicly said the Federal Trade Commission should investigate and fine Uber for its behavior.   The risks to Uber's business posed by its reputation could weigh on the price that any buyer would be willing to pay. SoftBank and its leader, Masayoshi Son, have made clear that the investment firm is willing to play hardball, and it has hinted that it will put money into Uber's rival Lyft if it does not get an offer that it likes from Uber.   Bloomberg earlier reported SoftBank's opening bid.   SoftBank is joined by Dragoneer Investment Group, which is also seeking to gain a piece of Uber at a discounted price.   The tender offer had long been in the making. Uber's board had agreed in October to move forward with a deal with SoftBank, which was signed off on this month.   Under the agreement, SoftBank and Dragoneer plan to buy at least 14 percent of Uber through a combination of new and existing stock. SoftBank intends to buy about $1 billion of fresh stock at Uber's current valuation of about $68.5 billion, but the rest of the deal would be purchasing existing Uber shares from investors, most likely at a lower price. That maneuver would help prop up Uber's price.     "
Yahoo Delays Its Sale to Verizon Until the Second Quarter,"SAN FRANCISCO - Yahoo said on Monday that it now expected the sale of its core businesses to Verizon Communications to close no sooner than April, a delay from its earlier intention to conclude the deal in the first quarter. The delay drags out what has been a long goodbye for Yahoo's chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who was appointed nearly five years ago and failed to turn around the company, a long-fading web pioneer.  Yahoo's business improved slightly in the fourth quarter despite the distractions of its pending sale to Verizon and a drumbeat of disclosures about two thefts of sensitive account data belonging to hundreds of millions of users. Yahoo said that it saw no drop in usage after disclosures about the hacking, offering a counternarrative to Verizon's public suggestions that the data breaches had materially reduced the value of Yahoo's internet businesses. Verizon had agreed in July to buy those businesses for $4.8 billion, before Yahoo disclosed the hacks, which occurred in 2013 and 2014. ""With our 2016 and Q4 financial results ahead of plan, and the continued stability in our user engagement trends, the opportunities ahead with Verizon look bright,"" Ms. Mayer said in a statement accompanying the quarter's financial results. The company said that about 90 percent of daily Yahoo users had changed their security settings or were unaffected by the breaches. The breaches are under investigation by a host of government agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the S.E.C. was questioning if Yahoo had disclosed the breaches to investors in a timely manner. The S.E.C. and Yahoo declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal article. A Verizon spokesman, Bob Varettoni, said the company was still evaluating the effect of the data breaches on its proposed purchase but declined to comment further. Jeff Vogel, managing director at Bulger Partners, a technology strategy and investment banking firm based in Boston, said Verizon needed to assess the direct costs of the breaches, such as potential legal penalties and compensation to customers, as well as any long-term tarnishing of Yahoo's brand. ""Separate and apart from what the S.E.C. does, Verizon has some tough decisions,"" Mr. Vogel said. ""They have to look very closely at the brand damage and expected deterioration in the parts of business affected by the breach."" Despite all of the controversy, Yahoo's business is now starting to perk up. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.47 billion, up 15 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago. Net income was $162 million, compared with a loss of $4.4 billion in the previous year. The company's preferred benchmark - adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - also improved, rising 51 percent, to $324 million. Yahoo noted that it had cut costs significantly over the past year, eliminating more than 2,100 jobs. For investors, the fate of Yahoo's core business has long been an afterthought, overshadowed by the company's 15 percent investment stake in Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce company, and its 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, a separate company controlled by SoftBank. Those stakes are worth a total of about $46 billion at current market prices. After the Verizon transaction, the shares will be owned by the remaining stub of Yahoo, which will be renamed Altaba.

Spyware Meant to Foil Crime Is Trained on Mexico's Critics,"MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's most prominent human rights lawyers, journalists and anti-corruption activists have been targeted by advanced spyware sold to the Mexican government on the condition that it be used only to investigate criminals and terrorists. The targets include lawyers looking into the mass disappearance of 43 students, a highly respected academic who helped write anti-corruption legislation, two of Mexico's most influential journalists and an American representing victims of sexual abuse by the police. The spying even swept up family members, including a teenage boy.    Since 2011, at least three Mexican federal agencies have purchased about $80 million worth of spyware created by an Israeli cyberarms manufacturer. The software, known as Pegasus, infiltrates smartphones to monitor every detail of a person's cellular life -- calls, texts, email, contacts and calendars. It can even use the microphone and camera on phones for surveillance, turning a target's smartphone into a personal bug.   The company that makes the software, the NSO Group, says it sells the tool exclusively to governments, with an explicit agreement that it be used only to battle terrorists or the drug cartels and criminal groups that have long kidnapped and killed Mexicans.    But according to dozens of messages examined by The New York Times and independent forensic analysts, the software has been used against some of the government's most outspoken critics and their families, in what many view as an unprecedented effort to thwart the fight against the corruption infecting every limb of Mexican society.   ''We are the new enemies of the state,'' said Juan E. Pardinas, the general director of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, who has pushed anti-corruption legislation. His iPhone, along with his wife's, was targeted by the software, according to an independent analysis. ''Ours is a society where democracy has been eroded,'' he said.   The deployment of sophisticated cyberweaponry against citizens is a snapshot of the struggle for Mexico itself, raising profound legal and ethical questions for a government already facing severe criticism for its human rights record. Under Mexican law, only a federal judge can authorize the surveillance of private communications, and only when officials can demonstrate a sound basis for the request.   It is highly unlikely that the government received judicial approval to hack the phones, according to several former Mexican intelligence officials. Instead, they said, illegal surveillance is standard practice.   ''Mexican security agencies wouldn't ask for a court order, because they know they wouldn't get one,'' said Eduardo Guerrero, a former analyst at the Center for Investigation and National Security, Mexico's intelligence agency and one of the government agencies that use the Pegasus spyware. ''I mean, how could a judge authorize surveillance of someone dedicated to the protection of human rights?''   ''There, of course, is no basis for that intervention, but that is besides the point,'' he added. ''No one in Mexico ever asks for permission to do so.''   The hacking attempts were highly personalized, striking critics with messages designed to inspire fear -- and get them to click on a link that would provide unfettered access to their cellphones.   Carmen Aristegui, one of Mexico's most famous journalists, was targeted by a spyware operator posing as the United States Embassy in Mexico, instructing her to click on a link to resolve an issue with her visa. The wife of Mr. Pardinas, the anti-corruption activist, was targeted with a message claiming to offer proof that he was having an extramarital affair.   For others, imminent danger was the entry point, like a message warning that a truck filled with armed men was parked outside Mr. Pardinas's home.   ''I think that any company that sells a product like this to a government would be horrified by the targets, of course, which don't seem to fall into the traditional role of criminality,'' said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, which examined the hacking attempts.   The Mexican government acknowledges gathering intelligence against legitimate suspects in accordance with the law. ''As in any democratic government, to combat crime and threats against national security the Mexican government carries out intelligence operations,'' it said in a statement.   But the government ''categorically denies that any of its members engages in surveillance or communications operations against defenders of human rights, journalists, anti-corruption activists or any other person without prior judicial authorization.''   The Mexican government's deployment of spyware has come under suspicion before, including hacking attempts on political opponents and activists fighting corporate interests in Mexico.   Still, there is no ironclad proof that the Mexican government is responsible. The Pegasus software does not leave behind the hacker's individual fingerprints. Even the software maker, the NSO Group, says it cannot determine who, exactly, is behind specific hacking attempts.   But cyberexperts can verify when the software has been used on a target's phone, leaving them with few doubts that the Mexican government, or some rogue actor within it, was involved.   ''This is pretty much as good as it gets,'' said Bill Marczak, another senior researcher at Citizen Lab, who confirmed the presence of NSO code on several phones belonging to Mexican journalists and activists.   Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that cybercriminals somehow got their hands on the software, the NSO Group says, because the technology can be used only by the government agency where it is installed.   The company is part of a growing number of digital spying businesses that operate in a loosely regulated space. The market has picked up in recent years, particularly as companies like Apple and Facebook start encrypting their customers' communications, making it harder for government agencies to conduct surveillance.   Increasingly, governments have found that the only way to monitor mobile phones is by using private businesses like the NSO Group that exploit little-known vulnerabilities in smartphone software. The company has, at times, operated its businesses under different names. One of them, OSY Technologies, paid Michael T. Flynn, President Trump's former national security adviser, more than $40,000 to be an advisory board member from May 2016 until January, according to his public financial disclosures.   Before selling to governments, the NSO Group says, it vets their human rights records. But once the company licenses the software and installs its hardware inside intelligence and law enforcement agencies, the company says, it has no way of knowing how its spy tools are used -- or whom they are used against.   The company simply bills governments based on the total number of surveillance targets. To spy on 10 iPhone users, for example, the company charges $650,000 on top of a flat $500,000 installation fee, according to NSO marketing proposals reviewed by The New York Times.   Even when the NSO Group learns that its software has been abused, there is only so much it can do, the company says, arguing that it cannot simply march into intelligence agencies, remove its hardware and take back its spyware.   ''When you're selling AK-47s, you can't control how they'll be used once they leave the loading docks,'' said Kevin Mahaffey, chief technology officer at Lookout, a mobile security company.   Rather, the NSO Group relies on its customers to cooperate in a review, then turns over the findings to the appropriate governmental authority -- in effect, leaving governments to police themselves.   Typically, the company's only recourse is to slowly cut off a government's access to the spy tools over the course of months, or even years, by ceasing to provide new software patches, features and updates. But in the case of Mexico, the NSO Group has not condemned or even acknowledged any abuse, despite repeated evidence that its spy tools have been deployed against ordinary citizens and their families.   From Hope to Intimidation   Journalists, human rights defenders and anti-corruption campaigners have long faced enormous risks in Mexico. For decades, they have been followed, harassed, threatened and even killed for their work, occupational hazards more common in authoritarian states than in countries in good standing with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, as Mexico is.   But when President Enrique Peña Nieto came into office in 2012, promising to lift Mexico to its rightful place on the world stage, there was an inkling of hope that the nation's democracy was coming into its own.   His party passed a list of badly needed changes, taking aim at the failing education system and moving to enhance the transparency of Mexico's bureaucracy. Competition in some core industries, like telecommunications, has increased.   But by 2014, much of the early promise of the Peña Nieto administration was dashed by the crises subsuming it, including the mysterious disappearance of 43 teaching students after a clash with the police, and accusations that the president and his wife got a special deal on a multimillion-dollar home from a government contractor.   The scandals have left an enduring mark on the president's reputation. After a stunning rise built on a perfectly crafted image -- a young, energetic president working across party lines, the embodiment of a new Mexico -- Mr. Peña Nieto was suddenly recast as an out-of-touch, corrupt politician with abysmal approval ratings.   In no small part, that fall was thanks to the Mexican journalists who broke news of the scandals, as well as the lawyers and activists who refused to let the country forget about them.   ''You have to remember this was a government that went from setting the agenda to being entirely reactive,'' said Carlos Loret de Mola, a news anchor for Televisa who has some of the best sources inside the Mexican government.   Mr. Loret de Mola, who received at least eight messages laced with NSO software, added, ''They looked at journalists and thought, 'They are bringing these things out and embarrassing us, so it's better if we spy on them.'''   Mexico is still a far cry from Turkey, which jails more journalists than any other nation in the world. It is hardly China, an authoritarian state where critics are silenced and a Western-style free press has been cast as a political peril by the government. But Mexico is in crisis on these fronts all the same.   More journalists were killed in Mexico last year than during any other year this century, and 2017 is off to an even worse start. Government critics are routinely harassed and threatened, and now they are being targeted with incredibly sophisticated software.   ''The fact that the government is using high-tech surveillance against human rights defenders and journalists exposing corruption, instead of those responsible for those abuses, says a lot about who the government works for,'' said Luis Fernando García, the executive director of R3D, a digital rights group in Mexico that has helped identify multiple abuses of Pegasus in Mexico. ''It's definitely not for the people.''   'About Getting Revenge'   Perhaps no journalist in Mexico has done as much to damage the reputation of the president than Carmen Aristegui. And few have paid as dearly for it.   In 2014, she and her team broke the scandal of the so-called Casa Blanca, or White House, a story of real estate intrigue that involved a special deal handed to Mexico's first lady, Angélica Rivera, by a major government contractor close to the president.   The story reached a worldwide audience and forced the president's wife to surrender the house, presenting the Mexican government with the sort of ethical quandary that in a different country might result in a congressional inquiry or the appointment of an independent prosecutor.   Instead, the president was cleared of wrongdoing by a prosecutor who had worked closely with his campaign team, while Ms. Aristegui lost her job. That moment marked the beginning of a sustained campaign of harassment and defamation against her: lawsuits, break-ins at her offices, threats to her safety and the monitoring of her movements.   ''It's been about getting revenge for the piece,'' she said. ''There's really no other way to see it.''   So when she began receiving text messages in 2015 from unknown numbers, instructing her to click on a link, she was suspicious. One message asked for her help in locating a missing child. Another alerted her to sudden charge on her credit card. And she received a text message purportedly from the American Embassy about a problem with her visa. Impersonating an American government official is a possible violation of United States law.   When the messages failed to entice her to click on the links and inadvertently download the software, they grew increasingly strident, including one warning that she could be imprisoned. Several came from the same phone number, leaving a record of the spyware operator's sloppiness.   Still, the spyware operators pressed on. Starting as early as March, they began targeting Ms. Aristegui's then-16-year-old son, Emilio, who was living in the United States at the time. Some of the texts were similar to the ones she had received. Others were made-up headlines about Ms. Aristegui, sent from what appeared to be a news agency.   ''The only reason they could be going after my son is in the hopes of finding something against me, to damage me,'' she said.   Ms. Aristegui is the embodiment of the hope -- and the crushing limitations -- for a free media in Mexico. Though she was fired over what her employer called internal disagreements, she continued publishing on her own, eventually drawing enough of an audience to sustain a team of reporters.   But the work has taken its toll. In one lawsuit, filed by the president of her former employer, a judge cited Ms. Aristegui last November for her ''excessive use of freedom of speech.''   Her website, Aristegui Noticias, has been hacked numerous times, including on the eve of publishing a major investigation into the massacre of more than a dozen civilians by the federal police.   And her offices were broken into last November. So brazen were the assailants that they didn't bother wearing masks. Nor did they steal much -- one computer, a watch and a bag hanging from the back of a chair. Their faces and fingerprints were captured on cameras in the office. Still, no one has been caught.   The threats, harassment, even the spying, all of it she channels into work.   ''For me, I have opted to believe that my public work is what will best protect me,'' she said. ''The great challenge for journalists and citizens is that the fear serve us, and not conquer us.''   Texts Laced With Menace   It was Dec. 21, 2015, and Mr. Pardinas was at the beach with his family, trying to enjoy the start of his Christmas vacation. But his phone kept buzzing, at first with calls from lawyers, and then with an odd text message.   It had been a long few months in an even longer campaign: to pass an unprecedented law forcing Mexico's public servants to disclose their financial conflicts of interest.   In November, he had presented a study on the costs of corruption in Mexico, confirming with facts and figures something that nearly all Mexicans knew in their hearts -- that corruption was crippling the country.   He followed it up with media interviews, poking fun at the Mexican government's embarrassing response to corruption. He joked that it probably spent more money on coffee and cookies than on the office in charge of prosecuting graft.   The study, the interviews, a seemingly endless gantlet of meetings with politicians -- it all laid the groundwork for the new law, which Mr. Pardinas, a private citizen directing a public policy group, was helping to write.   So even as Christmas approached and his family relaxed in the coastal town of Puerto Vallarta, Mr. Pardinas was busily consulting lawyers on the final draft, which he had just over a month to submit.   And then a message: ''My father died at dawn, we are devastated, I'm sending you the details of the wake, I hope you can come.'' Attached was a link.   Mr. Pardinas thought it odd that whoever had sent such a personal text was not even among the contacts in his phone. He showed his wife the message, and decided to ignore it.   Things only picked up from there, both on his proposed law and the odd messages. The government roundly ignored his bill, until he and others gathered more than 630,000 signatures supporting it.   Mr. Pardinas's tone grew bolder. He told one radio host that ''for the government of Mexico, anti-corruption measures are like garlic to a vampire.''   Then came another text message. This one appeared to be from the news outlet Uno TV, which sends daily news headlines to cellphone users across the country. The headline struck him: ''The History of Corruption Within the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness.'' It was particularly alarming because that was his organization.   He declined once more to click on the link, suspecting foul play. More text messages came, including the next day. Only this time, having failed with Mr. Pardinas, they tried his wife.   The message, sent from the same news headline service, said that leaked videos showed Mr. Pardinas having sexual relations with a member of his staff. It was also sent to a colleague.   Mr. Pardinas called his wife, telling her that she appeared to be part of a broader harassment effort. ''Oh, it's these people again,'' she responded.   The campaign to pass the law continued, and the bill made it through Congress relatively unscathed. But the Senate decided to add an extra provision: Everyone who worked for a company that received government money would also have to disclose their interests and assets. That meant the bill would cover more than 30 million people.   The president vetoed the bill, saying it needed more discussion, essentially kicking the can down the road.   Mr. Pardinas continued his broadsides in interviews, naming obstructive lawmakers and well-connected companies that benefited from government money. Few activists go so far as to name names in interviews, but Mr. Pardinas, who holds a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics, plowed ahead anyway.   The initiative seemed doomed. Yet another message arrived, on Aug. 1, this one laced with menace: ''Listen, outside of your house is a truck with two armed guys, I took their photo look at them and be careful.''   Mr. Pardinas, who was at work when this message came, once again declined to take the bait. But he did call his wife, again, asking her to look out their window to see if there was a truck parked outside. There was not.   ''By the end, my wife had Olympic-style training in this hacking stuff,'' Mr. Pardinas said.   'It Comes With the Territory'   Mario E. Patrón was on edge. The conference table was packed with fellow human rights defenders, including the United Nations commissioner for human rights in Mexico. Everyone was there to discuss the bombshell expected to drop.   An international panel brought to Mexico to investigate the haunting disappearance of 43 teaching students was releasing its final report the next day, at the end of April 2016. The findings, Mr. Patrón knew, were going to be brutal.   The government would be accused of negligence, incompetence, even malfeasance in its handling of the case. Like others in the room, Mr. Patrón, whose organization represents the parents of the missing students, was wondering how the government would respond.   His phone buzzed and he glanced at the screen. ''THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO GETS OUT IN FRONT OF THE GIEI,'' the text message read, using the acronym for the international panel. It seemed like the news he had been waiting for.   He showed the message to his colleague, then clicked on the link. But instead of an article or a news release, it simply redirected him to a blank page. Confused, he left the meeting and raced to his office to begin making calls to see what the government had in store.   And like that, he fell into their trap.   Mr. Patrón is the executive director of the  Miguel Augustín Pro Juárez Human Rights Center, perhaps the most highly respected human rights group in Mexico. The group focuses on the nation's most serious cases of human rights abuses, making it a nettlesome critic of the government.   In addition to Mr. Patrón, two other lawyers for the group were targeted with the software: Santiago Aguirre, the primary lawyer representing the families of the missing students, and Stephanie E. Brewer, a Harvard-educated American lawyer who has worked for the group since 2007.   ''We have always suspected they spied on us and listened to us,'' Mr. Patrón said. ''But to have evidence that we are victims of actual surveillance -- it confirms that we are under threat. And that the government is willing to use illegal measures to try and stop us.''   Beyond the missing students, Centro Prodh, as the group is called, is representing one of the few survivors of a military raid in 2014 in the town of Tlatlaya, where the army stormed a suspected cartel hide-out and killed 22 people.   While pursuing the case, the group unearthed a memorandum ordering the soldiers to kill suspected cartel members, strengthening the argument that the events did not unfold as a firefight, as the military claimed, but were instead extrajudicial executions carried out by the soldiers.   The organization's clients also include the women of Atenco, a group of 11 university students, activists and market vendors who were arrested by the police more than 10 years ago during protests in the town of San Salvador Atenco and brutally sexually assaulted on the way to prison.   Aside from the grave abuse of power, the case was especially sensitive: The governor who ordered the crackdown on the protesters was Enrique Peña Nieto, now the president of Mexico.   From the very beginning, the case was an uphill battle. Arrested on trumped-up charges, some of the women spent more time in prison than the officers who raped them.   Finding no recourse in Mexico, Ms. Brewer and others appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a regional body outside the Mexican judicial system, to review the case. And they waited -- for nearly seven years.   Finally, in 2015, the commission found in favor of the women, ordering the government to investigate the case all the way up the chain of command, a directive that would include Mr. Peña Nieto. Ultimately, the case was sent to the Inter-American Court, an independent judiciary with jurisdiction over Mexico, a major blow to the nation's presidency.   One evening Ms. Brewer was at home, getting ready for bed when a text message arrived. The date practically coincided with the 10-year anniversary of the assaults on the women, an eerie bookend to their decade-long struggle for justice.   On her phone was a provocative question, a taunt even, asking whether anyone defended the soldiers and members of Mexico's navy who also suffered abuse.   ''And you guys that do human rights against this, what about the dignity of them ...'' The message contained a link, presumably to a news story or a tip.   Intrigued, Ms. Brewer clicked on it. She was directed to a broken link, a telltale sign of the malware.   ''It's just part of defending human rights in Mexico,'' she said. ''It comes with the territory.''     "
Former President of Panama Battles Extradition in Miami,"MIAMI -- The former president of Panama faced a federal magistrate judge in Miami on Tuesday, in a plea to stay out of jail and fight extradition on charges that he ''commandeered'' sophisticated wiretapping gear to listen in on political enemies, business rivals and even a mistress. Ricardo A. Martinelli, 65, who governed Panama from 2009 until 2014, was arrested last week in Coral Gables, Fla., on illegal surveillance and embezzlement charges. Mr. Martinelli moved to South Florida shortly after his presidency ended and requested political asylum, saying the new president had lodged a politically motivated case against him.    Panama wants him back.    While Tuesday's bail hearing before United States Judge Edwin G. Torres covered topics like flight risk and the complexities of international extradition treaties, it also offered a view of the unorthodox methods that governments use to keep track of their foes.   Prosecutors say Mr. Martinelli diverted $13.4 million meant for social programs for the poor to pay for software that allowed him to hack into cellphones. He is accused of running a stealth national security operation to keep an eye on dozens of business competitors, opposition lawmakers and union activists to glean embarrassing and compromising information on them.   The more salacious findings wound up on YouTube, according to an affidavit filed by a former Panamanian national security analyst.   The spyware equipment Mr. Martinelli is accused of using, Pegasus, uses malicious links in misleading text messages to infiltrate cellphones to monitor emails, contacts and text messages. Lawmakers were taped having sex. One was recorded being accused by her husband of having an extramarital affair.   Other countries are believed to have abused the spyware as well. In Mexico, at least three federal agencies have bought about $80 million worth of spyware created by an Israeli cyberarms maker.   The company that makes the software Mexico used, the NSO Group, says it sells the tool exclusively to governments, with an explicit agreement that it be used only against terrorists, drug cartels and criminal groups. The advanced spyware bought by the Mexican government was used to target Mexico's most prominent human rights defenders, journalists and anti-corruption activists, according to an investigation by The New York Times published on Monday.   ''It could remotely control the microphone and the camera on certain telephone models,'' Ismael Pitti, a former national security analyst in Panama who admitted participating in the scheme, said in an affidavit filed in United States District Court in Miami. ''With these capabilities, we could obtain photographs and record 'background audio,' in other words, conversations of people close to the telephone.''   But Mr. Pitti's former boss at the National Security Council, Ronny Rodríguez, submitted an affidavit disputing the accusations and saying that the new administration in Panama had offered him a job in Washington if he incriminated the former president.   Because the equipment disappeared from where it had been secretly stored and used, and the server taken to Mr. Martinelli's private business, the former president was also charged with embezzlement by misappropriation, prosecutors said.   The case also has a political back story, defense lawyers say.   The president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, had been chosen to be Mr. Martinelli's vice president and foreign minister. Mr. Varela was from a different political party, but the ticket was meant to be a coalition government.   Mr. Martinelli said he had to fire Mr. Varela from his foreign minister post because he was caught receiving bribes from consulates, according to court papers.   But in 2014, Mr. Varela himself won the presidency. His government began the inquiry against Mr. Martinelli, and in late 2015, ordered his arrest.   But days before a warrant was issued, Mr. Martinelli fled the country.   Mr. Martinelli was not arrested until this month, shortly after he announced his candidacy for president on Twitter. The bail hearing took place just a day after Mr. Varela visited the White House, underscoring the political undertones the case has taken, the defense lawyers said.   ''This may be the only extradition case in history where the country seeking extradition is being led by a man who is not only a political opponent of the defendant but was publicly and notoriously fired by him,'' Mr. Martinelli's lawyers, Marcos D. Jiménez and John R. Byrne, wrote in a motion filed Monday.   They argue that not only is the former president not guilty of the accusations leveled against him, but that the charges are not offenses for which one can be extradited.   The extradition treaty between the United States and Panama does not cover wiretapping, because the treaty is about 100 years old and such a crime did not then exist, Panama's vice president, Isabel Saint Malo, told the Council on Foreign Relations last year.   She also said the process could get complicated because Mr. Martinelli is a suspect in other corruption cases. If he is extradited in the surveillance case, that could prevent Panama from prosecuting him on other charges, she said.   ''I believe it's almost 10 cases that are in the Supreme Court regarding Mr. Martinelli right now,'' she said to the council. ''And most of them are a lot more serious than listening in to conversations, which is serious enough.''   In court, Mr. Jiménez, a former United States attorney in Miami, presented an interview of one of the magistrates in the case in Panama against Mr. Martinelli. In the interview, which was published this year, the magistrate himself says Panama's judiciary lacks independence.   ''They are trying to say he's a flight risk because he fled Panama,'' Mr. Jiménez said. ''Of course he left Panama -- they have a corrupt judicial system.''   Defense lawyers asked Judge Torres to throw out the extradition request, arguing, among other things, that Mr. Martinelli has immunity as a former president and as a current member of the Central American Parliament, and that the arrest warrant from Panama was invalid because of serious procedural missteps.   If the judge does not reject the extradition request, the defense lawyers proposed that their client be released on $5 million bond, as well as a $2 million bond co-signed by another person, and that he also be allowed to remain under house arrest with electronic monitoring and 24-hour guarding of his home.   The United States attorney's office submitted a motion urging the court to keep Mr. Martinelli in jail until the extradition case is decided. The motion said granting bond would embarrass the United States and compromise the ability to extradite fugitives from other countries.   Mr. Martinelli could face 21 years in prison and is a flight risk who has ''demonstrated that he is highly adept at moving himself to avoid prosecution,'' prosecutors said.   The judge said he would rule within a week.   The owner of a chain of supermarkets, Mr. Martinelli has a plane and two helicopters and ''has amassed an astounding amount of wealth, wealth that would facilitate an easy escape to a third country and sustain him and his family in exile for decades,'' prosecutors said.

Spyware Trailed Investigators in Mexico,"MEXICO CITY -- A team of international investigators brought to Mexico to unravel one of the nation's gravest human rights atrocities was targeted with sophisticated surveillance technology sold to the Mexican government to spy on criminals and terrorists. The spying took place during what the investigators call a broad campaign of harassment and interference that prevented them from solving the haunting case of 43 students who disappeared after clashing with the police nearly three years ago.    Appointed by an international commission that polices human rights in the Americas, the investigators say they were quickly met with stonewalling by the Mexican government, a refusal to turn over documents or grant vital interviews, and even a retaliatory criminal investigation.   Now, forensic evidence shows that the international investigators were being targeted by advanced surveillance technology as well.    The main contact person for the group of investigators received text messages laced with spyware known as Pegasus, a cyberweapon that the government of Mexico spent tens of millions of dollars to acquire, according to an independent analysis. The coordinator's phone was used by nearly all members of the group, often serving as a nexus of communication among the investigators, their sources, the international commission that appointed them and the Mexican government.   Beyond that, the investigators say they received identical text messages on their own phones, too, luring them to click on links that secretly unlock a target's smartphone and turn it into a powerful surveillance device. Calls, emails, text messages, calendars and contacts can all be monitored that way. Encrypted messages become worthless. Even the microphone and camera on a smartphone can be used against its owner.   The effort to spy on international officials adds to a sweeping   espionage offensive in Mexico, where some of the country's most prominent journalists, human rights lawyers and anticorruption activists have been the targets of the same surveillance technology. But the new evidence shows that the spying campaign went beyond the nation's domestic critics.   It also swept up international officials who had been granted a status akin to diplomatic immunity as well as unprecedented access to investigate a case that has come to define the nation's broken rule of law -- and the legacy of its president, Enrique Peña Nieto.   Surveillance under Mexican law can be conducted only with the authorization of a federal judge, and only if the government can show cause to do so. But the kind of diplomatic immunity the investigators received meant that it was extremely unlikely that a federal judge would have been allowed to sign off on such a warrant, the investigators said.   ''You are not just hacking anyone's phone, you are hacking the phone of someone who has been granted immunity,'' said Francisco Cox, one of the investigators and a prominent Chilean lawyer. ''They couldn't even search my bags in the airport.''   ''If this can happen to an independent body that has immunity and that is invited by the government, it is a bit scary to think of what could happen to a common citizen in Mexico,'' he said.   Since 2011, Mexico has purchased at least $80 million worth of the spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, and only on the condition that it be used against terrorists and criminals. But an investigation by The New York Times and forensic cyberanalysts in recent weeks determined that the software had been used against some of the country's most influential academics, lawyers, journalists and their family members, including a teenage boy.   The government has denied responsibility for the espionage, adding that there is no ironclad proof because the spyware does not leave behind the hacker's individual fingerprints. It has promised a thorough investigation, vowing to call on specialists from the United Nations and the F.B.I. for help. One of the surveillance targets, the forensic analysis showed, was a United States lawyer representing victims of sexual assault by the Mexican police.   But the United States ambassador to Mexico, Roberta S. Jacobson, said the United States was not involved in the investigation. Opposition lawmakers and international officials are now calling for an independent inquiry into the spying scandal, declaring Mexico unfit to investigate itself.   ''This case just on its face -- and presuming the veracity of the allegations -- is serious enough to warrant the creation of an international commission,'' said James L. Cavallaro, a commissioner on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which appointed the group of experts. ''The commission shares the concerns of others: How can the government be trusted to investigate its own alleged violation of citizen rights given its track record in this matter?''   Another commissioner, Esmeralda Arosemena de Troitiño, backed the idea of an independent inquiry. ''This investigation should find both the material and intellectual authors of the alleged spying,'' she said.   Top officials from the nation's main opposition party have come forward to say that they, too, have been targeted, raising the pressure on the government. The head of the National Action Party, Ricardo Anaya, says his party is pushing for a congressional committee to conduct its own inquiry and will also formally demand an international investigation into the spying.   ''The grand tragedy of Mexico is impunity. Horrible things occur, and nothing happens,'' he said. ''This time, we will not let that happen.''   The disappearance of the students in September 2014 ignited an enormous outcry in Mexico. Hundreds of thousands poured into the streets to protest a case that, to many, represented all that afflicts Mexico, a nation where about 30,000 people have disappeared and more than 100,000 have been killed in the decade-long churn of the drug war.   The anger also focused on Mr. Peña Nieto, whose determination to change the narrative of his country from one of desperate violence to economic promise was suddenly, and permanently, upended. The outrage has been matched only by the disbelief that, almost three years later, nearly all of the 43 students are still missing. The remains of one have been discovered. Fragments of another may also have been identified. The rest of the students, whether dead or alive, have not been found.   Many Mexicans believed that their best chance of finding out what really happened to the students lay with the international investigators, who were appointed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a regional body based in Washington that monitors countries and can refer cases to court. But the investigators said the government essentially obstructed their inquiry and then cast them out by refusing to extend their mandate -- evidence, they said, that the government simply did not want the case solved.   Still, it is hard to prove who ordered the spying. Even the manufacturer of the spyware, an Israeli cyberarms manufacturer called the NSO Group, says it cannot determine who, precisely, is behind specific hacking attempts using its technology.   But the company says that it sells its surveillance tools only to governments, and that stringent safeguards prevent them from being used by anyone outside of the government agencies that purchase the technology.   Moreover, once a person's phone is targeted, researchers can verify that the spyware has been deployed by examining the text message to determine whether it points to a server running NSO's technology. They have confirmed at least 19 cases in Mexico involving human rights lawyers, anticorruption activists, journalists and, now, international officials.   ''Citizen Lab and our partners are finding people targeted with NSO spyware almost wherever we look in Mexico,'' said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, which has worked with the digital rights group R3D in Mexico to identify the spyware on the phones of targeted activists and officials.   ''I have never seen anything that matches the scale and scope of this case,'' he said of the surveillance campaign in Mexico.   Hacking attempts disguised as text messages appeared on the cellphone of the executive secretary for the investigators, the point person for all contacts with the group, on March 1 and 4, 2016, the forensic analysis found. Around the same time, lawyers for Centro Prodh, a human rights group looking into the mass disappearance of the students, were also being targeted by the software.   ''The Mexican government implored the commission to create this expert group, and then when their investigation did not ratify the official version, things changed,'' said Mr. Cavallaro, who was the president of the Inter-American Commission at the time of the hacking attempts. ''If it's true that the government spied or tried to spy on our experts, that would be an outrage of historic proportions.''   The investigators sent a private letter to the Inter-American Commission late last month, detailing their suspicions after The Times published an article about the hacking campaign. They said some of their phones had also been subject to suspicious messages.   One message, sent to one of the investigators in March, was from someone posing as a close friend whose father had died. A link was attached with the details of the funeral. When the link was opened, the website of a well-known funeral home in Mexico popped up. A similar message, with the same link, was also sent last year to an academic trying to impose a sugar tax in Mexico. In that case, the message was confirmed as Pegasus.   During the hacking attempts on the investigators, the group was in the throes of a crisis. The investigators had just complained publicly of being harassed, and they were less than two months from publishing their final report, which rejected the government's version of what happened to the students.   The mystery began on Sept. 26, 2014, when about 100 students from a teachers' college in the town of Ayotzinapa struck out to commandeer some buses. As they had in years past, the students planned to take the buses to Mexico City to attend a commemorative march and then return them, a tradition both the bus companies and the authorities typically tolerated.   But that night soon turned into an ominous chapter in Mexico's modern history. The police fired mercilessly on the students and the buses transporting them, leaving six dead and scores wounded. The police emptied two buses of students, detained them and whisked them away in patrol cars.   The government maintains that local police officers, along with the drug gang they worked for, kidnapped the students, killed them and incinerated their bodies in a nearby dump.   The government version, however, never offered a clear motive for the attack on the students, and Mexicans pushed for an international inquiry. Eventually, the government agreed, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights appointed a five-member team of prominent prosecutors and rights activists from across the Spanish-speaking world.   When the investigators arrived in Mexico, after months of local protests over the disappearances, it was an exceptional moment: a reclusive government opening itself up to external scrutiny.   But within a few months, the relationship between the government and the investigators began to sour. In its first report, the investigators contradicted a central tenet of the government's version, saying it could find no evidence of a fire big enough to burn 43 bodies, nor any remnants or bone fragments that matched those of the missing.   The acrimony came quickly. Pro-government newspapers began attacking the group, and the Mexican government opened a criminal investigation against the executive secretary of the Inter-American Commission, based on unsubstantiated claims about the misuse of funds.   ''We always worked in good faith, and we went with open eyes and an open mind, only going where the facts led us,'' said Mr. Cox, one of the investigators. ''Our purpose was to contribute to the rule of law in Mexico.''     "
Spyware That Governments Can't Resist,"First came the revelation that prominent Mexican anti-corruption fighters, human rights activists and other government critics were targeted for surveillance with sophisticated spyware sold to the Mexican government for combating crime and terrorism. Now comes the shocking addendum that an international team charged with investigating the disappearance of 43 students in Mexico was also being watched with the spyware known as Pegasus, which secretly monitors a cellphone.  The alarming disclosures raise two related issues. One is the abuse by the government -- or by some rogue elements in it -- of highly sophisticated and expensive cyberwarfare technology. The government has denied responsibility for the espionage, but it acquired the weaponry, and using it against citizens raises profound legal and ethical questions, especially for a government already facing severe criticism over human rights.    The other issue is whether commercial vendors of mass surveillance tools, however well intentioned, can really control what they are used for. In this case, the NSO Group, an Israeli firm, said it sold Pegasus only to governments, only after checking their human rights practices and only on the condition that it be used solely for tracking criminals and terrorists. But NSO admitted that after a sale, it had no control over how the spyware was used. And once discovered in a phone, it is not possible to determine who planted it.   What is known is that Mexican federal agencies have bought about $80 million worth of spyware created by NSO since 2011, and that it was deployed against influential academics, lawyers, journalists and their family members, and a group of international investigators.   The investigators were assigned with Mexico's consent to look into the disappearance of 43 students in September 2014 after they were detained by the police en route to a march in Mexico City. The government claimed that local police officers and a drug gang they worked for killed the students. Months of public protests compelled the government to agree to an outside investigation, but once this cast doubt on the government version, the team came under harassment and surveillance. The investigators left Mexico in April 2016, and the case remains a mystery.   The mass disappearance has already done great damage to Mexico and its president, Enrique Peña Nieto, who came to office promising to change the country's image. That image has only been worsened by the latest revelations. Such blatant abuse of dangerous technology warrants another international investigation. Mr. Peña Nieto has said he would welcome outside help; this time he should mean it.   A lot more should be done to monitor and control commercial spyware. The temptation for governments to misuse it is intense, and the proscriptions of manufacturers like the NSO Group are obviously insufficient.

Biometrics Ease Boarding,"Two United States air carriers, Delta Air Lines and JetBlue, recently began passenger trials in biometric identification, a technology that verifies a person's identity through fingerprints, facial features or other physical characteristics.  In early June, JetBlue, teaming up with United States Customs and Border Protection, introduced optional self-boarding on flights from Logan International Airport in Boston to Beatrix International Airport in Aruba. The process requires no boarding pass and takes about three seconds, said Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue's executive vice president for customer experience.    Fliers who choose to try it out step up to a camera at the boarding gate for a quick photo. This image is matched with passport, visa or immigration photos in the Customs and Border Protection database, and once flight details and identity are confirmed, a check mark appears on the camera and fliers can board the plane. So far, more than 90 percent of passengers are using this self-boarding process, Ms. Geraghty said, and if the trial is successful, the airline plans to expand biometric identification to more flights.   ''The technology is revolutionary because your face becomes your passport and travel document,'' she said. (These boarding processes, however, are not a replacement for the security screening done by the Transportation Security Administration.)   Delta is using biometric identification to allow fliers to check their own bags at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, the airline's second-largest hub after Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The airline invested $600,000 in four self-service bag drop machines equipped with biometric technology; a passport is needed to use it.   Passengers print out their luggage stickers at a check-in kiosk and then head to one of the bag drop machines, where they scan their passports and have their picture taken by the machine. Once the images on their passports are matched with the images from the machine and their identities are confirmed, they place their bags on the belt; the machine weighs the bags and moves them on.   Gareth Joyce, the company's senior vice president for airport customer experience, said the process took around 30 seconds.   Delta and JetBlue are just two of several airlines putting biometric identification in place: In 2014, Alaska Airlines introduced fingerprint scanners to allow entry into its airport lounges, and more recently, British Airways opened three self-boarding gates for domestic flights with facial recognition technology at Heathrow Airport in London.

Change the Key That Unlocks Your Accounts,"Q. I was using an authenticator app to get security codes for my email account, but I got a new phone and now the app doesn't work after I transferred my stuff. How do I get this working again?  A. For security reasons, many authenticator apps do not transfer login codes and app data from an old phone to a new one. Instead, you usually have to log into your mail account on the web and remove the old app from your account settings. Then you download the authenticator app to your new phone and link it with your mail account, as you first did with the old phone. Each authenticator app has its own specific steps, but the popular programs from Microsoft and Google follow a similar approach.    If you were using Microsoft Authenticator as a two-step verification method for your Microsoft mail, log into your mail account on the web, click the link for your account security settings and click ''more options'' on the page. In the Identity Verification Apps section, click ''Turn off all existing apps'' and then choose ''Set up identity verification app.'' Follow the steps on the screen to add the app on your new phone. Back on your old phone, delete your mail account from the authenticator app by clicking the Edit Accounts button, or swiping to the right on an account name to delete it.   Google Authenticator can also be updated on a new phone, but you may want to log into your account and make a set of backup codes to use before you begin the transfer process -- or have other identity verification methods in place. Google's support site has its own step-by-step guide for getting two-step verification code on a new phone, along with how to remove your account from the authenticator app on your old phone.

Documents Reignite Tensions Between Tech World and Spy Agencies,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Four years ago, Edward J. Snowden's disclosures that the federal government was hacking America's leading technology companies threw the industry into turmoil. Now WikiLeaks has shaken the tech world again by releasing documents Tuesday that appear to show that the Central Intelligence Agency had acquired an array of cyberweapons that could be used to break into Apple and Android smartphones, Windows computers, automotive computer systems, and even smart televisions to conduct surveillance on unwitting users.    Major technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, were trying to assess how badly their core products had been compromised. But one thing clearly had been ruptured yet again: trust between intelligence agencies and Silicon Valley.    ''After the Snowden disclosures, the Obama administration worked hard to re-establish relationships and government-industry partnerships,'' said David Gutelius, chief executive of the marketing technology company Motiva, who has worked with the federal government on national security projects. ''This leak will challenge those ties to some extent. But I don't see companies simply walking away from the table as a result of this. Government and industry still need one another.''   The tense relationship between the technology industry and government agencies has been well documented. After the disclosures by Mr. Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the government appeared to give some ground to the industry, which was angered by previously unknown snooping on their products and embarrassed by disclosures of their cooperation with intelligence agencies.   The government allowed companies to describe in broad terms the number of secret court orders for access to customer information that they receive. President Barack Obama also promised that the government would share knowledge of security flaws so that they could be fixed.   But last year, relations soured again after Apple resisted a Justice Department request for help accessing the iPhone of one of the attackers in the 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. As the company's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, explained in a letter to customers at the time, ''The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers.''   In that case, the government eventually found a way into the phone without Apple's assistance.   The documents posted by WikiLeaks suggest that the C.I.A. had obtained information on 14 security flaws in Apple's iOS operating system for phones and tablets.   Apple said Tuesday night that many of those security issues had already been patched in the latest version of its software and it was working to address remaining vulnerabilities.   The leaked documents also identified at least two dozen flaws in Android, the most popular operating system for smartphones, which was developed by Alphabet's Google division.   Google said it was studying the flaws identified by WikiLeaks. Android is more difficult to secure than Apple's software because many phone makers and carriers use older or customized versions of the software.   The documents released by WikiLeaks reveal numerous efforts by the C.I.A. to take control of Microsoft Windows, the dominant operating system for personal computers, using malware. They include techniques for infecting DVDs and USB storage devices with malware that can be spread to computers when they are plugged in.   ''We're aware of the report and are looking into it,'' Microsoft said in a statement.   Security experts said it was not surprising that the government had stockpiled flaws in major technology products to use for spying. ''The real scandal and damaging thing is not knowing these things exist, but that the C.I.A. could be so careless with them that they leaked out,'' said Matthew D. Green, an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Johns Hopkins University.   Inside technology companies, the revelations set off a scramble to assess the potential damage to the security of their products.   The vulnerabilities, some of which were already known in the security community, could leave individual users of computers, mobile phones and other devices open to being snooped on. Technology companies are likely to plug the holes, however, even as new ones are discovered by spy agencies and others.   The more serious near-term effect could be on the reputation of the C.I.A. and the relationship between the technology industry and the intelligence community.   Denelle Dixon, chief legal and business officer at Mozilla, which makes the Firefox web browser and was mentioned in the WikiLeaks trove, said that if the reports were accurate, the C.I.A. and WikiLeaks were undermining the security of the internet.   ''The C.I.A. seems to be stockpiling vulnerabilities, and WikiLeaks seems to be using that trove for shock value rather than coordinating disclosure to the affected companies to give them a chance to fix it and protect users,'' Ms. Dixon said in a statement. ''Although today's disclosures are jarring, we hope this raises awareness of the severity of these issues and the urgency of collaborating on reforms.''   Oren Falkowitz, a former N.S.A. official and the chief executive of the cyberdefense firm Area 1 Security, said that WikiLeaks, run by Julian Assange, had again succeeded in disrupting the status quo, as it did during last year's presidential election with the release of emails from the Democratic National Committee. ''If you understand the Assange playbook,'' Mr. Falkowitz said, ''a lot of it is just to create chaos.''   But Mr. Falkowitz added that perhaps the most important message behind Tuesday's leaks was that neither government agencies nor companies can trust their employees to keep their most precious information secret.   ''We expect governments to be involved in espionage,'' he said. ''What we don't expect is that the people within these organizations would create vulnerabilities by disclosing them.''   In a statement accompanying the documents, WikiLeaks said that the security flaws could easily fall into the wrong hands.   ''Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike,'' the organization said. It said it was still reviewing whether to release any of the underlying software code.   The security flaws described by WikiLeaks are intended to target individual phones. They do not appear to give the intelligence agencies the ability to intercept electronic communications en masse.   ''What can you do as a user to defend?'' he asked. ''Boring stuff. Keep your software up to date. Don't run unneeded apps. Don't become a C.I.A. target.''   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
Protecting Your Data From Border Snoops,"Travelers, beware: When you take your gadgets abroad, maintaining the security of the data on your devices is just as important as protecting yourself from muggers. For whatever reason, foreign and domestic governments may have an interest in your personal data, including your social media accounts.    This is not just theoretical. Several travelers, including American citizens like Haisam Elsharkawi, were recently pressured into giving officers from the United States Customs and Border Protection access to their cellphones at the airport.    Some travelers now face additional privacy risks because of a new regulation that separates them from their computing equipment. This week, the Department of Homeland Security announced that passengers traveling from eight majority-Muslim countries to the United States could not bring devices larger than cellphones onto planes. So computers, tablets and other devices will have to be stowed in checked luggage.   Legally, citizens are not required to unlock their cellphones or share their passwords with United States government officials. But rules may vary depending on where you are traveling to and from. And any stopping by a government official can be inconvenient, and even intimidating.   What to do? There's one thing all the experts agree on: Do not lie to government officials about your passwords or social media accounts.   ''They'd make your life miserable if they found that out,'' said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company.   But there are methods for safeguarding your cellphones, tablets and computers from invasive searches, all while remaining honest. Here are some of the best tips, based on interviews with security and forensics specialists.   Consider a cheap device   The best way to prevent your information from being searched is to travel with a device that never had any of your data in the first place.   It's a wise idea to invest in a so-called travel device, a cheap smartphone or computer that you use only abroad: You don't want your nice equipment to get lost or stolen while traveling, anyway, let alone searched by border agents. So leave your fancy equipment -- along with your photo album, Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter apps -- at home.   Which devices to buy? The Wirecutter, the product recommendations site owned by The New York Times, published a guide on budget Android phones, including the $100 Moto G4 Play that comes unlocked so that it can work with foreign SIM cards. For cheap computers, consider a $550 Acer laptop or a $430 Dell Chromebook.   Disable fingerprint readers   Fingerprint sensors, like the ones found on many Apple and Android smartphones, are a nifty security feature for unlocking your phone quickly. But Jonathan Zdziarski, a security researcher who has taught forensics courses to law enforcement agencies on collecting data from smartphones, said your best bet when traveling was to turn the feature off.   That's because in the United States, law enforcement agencies have successfully used warrants to compel people to unlock their cellphones with a fingerprint. But because of your right to remain silent, it would be tough (though not impossible) for the federal government to force you to share your passcode. So disabling your fingerprint sensor when traveling is generally a safer move.   Don't memorize your passwords   The best way to protect your passwords is to not know them. When resisting a data frisk, it is easier to say you didn't memorize your password as opposed to refusing to provide it to border agents, Mr. Grossman said.   ''If you don't know them it's hard to compel you to give them over if you don't know how,'' he said. ''Even if somebody put a gun to my head, I don't know it.''   Password management apps like 1Password and LastPass can automatically create strong, lengthy passwords for all your online accounts and keep them stored in a vault that is accessible with one master password.   However, Mr. Grossman said you are better off traveling without your password management software loaded on your devices so that you won't be asked to hand over the master password to your vault. You could store a copy of the password vault on a cloud service like Dropbox and get access to your vault of passwords when you reach your travel destination, he said.   An alternative to using a password-managing app is to write your passwords down and leave them with someone you trust. After getting through customs, contact that person and ask him or her to read off your passwords.   Use two-step verification   In the unlikely event that you are asked to provide a password to your email or social media account, having two-step verification enabled will act as an extra safeguard -- assuming that you left your primary cellphone at home.   With two-step verification turned on, whenever you enter your password, you will receive a text message with a one-time code that you must enter before you can log in. Because the message containing the code would be sent to your phone at home, a customs agent wouldn't be able to log in to your account even if you gave up your password.   Of course, two-step verification could make logging in to your accounts difficult for yourself if you left your primary cellphone at home. You could always leave your phone with someone you trust and contact them to ask for codes when you are trying to log in. However, it would generally be wiser to stay off your social media accounts while traveling to avoid leaving any traces of data on a burner device.   Encrypt your devices   Whether you are using a burner device or your own, always make sure to lock down the system with encryption, which scrambles your data so it becomes indecipherable without the right key.   Desktop apps like BitLocker or Apple's FileVault let you encrypt your hard drive, requiring a passphrase to decrypt your files. To avoid surrendering this passphrase, you could jot it down and hand it to a friend and contact that person for the passphrase after crossing the border.   Back up to the cloud, then wipe before you cross   When you're traveling, at minimum you will need access to your address book and calendar, and you may also want to take some photos. But this is all sensitive information that border patrol agents could get their hands on.

Cornell Law to Start Technology-Focused Program on Roosevelt Island,"Cornell Law School, one of the top-ranked law schools in the nation, plans to offer a new juris doctorate program at the soon-to-be opened Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island in New York City.  Students at Cornell Law -- which is in Ithaca, northwest of New York City -- will be able to study legal issues including technology information, especially privacy and cybersecurity, at Cornell's new technology campus starting in the spring semester of 2018.    The new program in information and technology law will accommodate up to 20 full-time law students each semester.   The law school is No. 3 in job placement among law schools, but establishing a beachhead in Manhattan will put its students closer to a major tech center at a time when more legal employment is centered in and near cities.   ''The program provides an exciting new way for our students to study this important area of the law in the heart of the fastest growing tech market in the country,'' said Eduardo M. Peñalver, the school's dean.   Students will be able ''to explore the diverse legal issues raised by information and technology, such as privacy and cybersecurity, as well as the constitutional and regulatory implications of new technology and big data,'' he said.   Cornell will not be the only law school in New York City that offers technology courses. Fordham University's School of Law, for example, has an intellectual property and information technology law program. More law schools are encouraging students with technical backgrounds to seek a law degree, and more employers are recruiting law graduates conversant in technology and allied fields.   Cornell's program will be located on its new 12-acre, $2 billion campus, which is set to open in mid-2017 and represents a partnership with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. The program will be housed in a new building equipped with the latest systems, including geothermal heating and cooling.     "
Data Breach Adds to Storms to Worry Markets,"Technology and energy companies were hit hard on Friday while banks and insurers recovered some of their recent losses, leaving major United States indexes little changed on the day and moderately lower for the week. Shares of the credit monitoring company Equifax plunged after it disclosed a data breach that affected 143 million Americans. TransUnion and Experian shares also fell, while stock in data security companies like Symantec jumped as investors expected they would get more business.    Kroger said stiff competition forced it to cut prices, and shares of grocery stores and food companies slumped. Target also said it would lower prices. Shares in technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Intel and chip makers weakened.    As hurricanes continued to dominate the news, experts said they thought the storms would slow down economic growth in the third quarter. While that would be temporary, David Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen Asset Management, said the effect on the stock market could linger because it would be hard for investors to tell how much of any individual company's problems are caused by the weather.   ''The next couple of months are going to be pretty cloudy,'' Mr. Chalupnik said. He said insurance companies, cruise lines, and oil refiners based along the Gulf Coast or in the Southeast could take losses, and bad debt at credit card companies would probably increase. Because the storm will push the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates lower for a bit longer, that would hurt banks by keeping interest rates low on loans, he added.   The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 3.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,461.43. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 13.01 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,797.79. The Nasdaq composite dropped 37.68 points, or 0.6 percent, to 6,360.19.   Equifax, which hit record time highs last month, took its biggest one-day loss since 1999 after it said a digital intrusion exposed Social Security numbers and other information from 143 million Americans between mid-May and late July. Equifax stock tumbled $19.49, or 13.7 percent, to $123.23. TransUnion shares fell 3.8 percent and shares of Experian fell 0.7 percent in London.   Shares of the security software company Symantec rose $1.03, or 3.4 percent, to $31.63 and shares of a competitor, FireEye, rose 24 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $16.01.   Chubb stock rose $5.97, or 4.4 percent, to $140.85 and XL Group stock regained $2.13, or 5.8 percent, to $38.61. Still, investors expect the insurance industry to take steep losses from the hurricanes.   Kroger stock dropped $1.71, or 7.5 percent, to $21.06. Supervalu fell $1.43, or 6.8 percent, to $19.66. Target shed $1.15, or 2 percent, to $57.27 and Walmart gave up $1.25, or 1.5 percent, to $78.88.   Energy companies fell as benchmark United States crude skidded $1.61, or 3.3 percent, to $47.48 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 71 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $53.78 a barrel in London.   Wholesale gasoline declined 1 cent to $1.65 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.77 a gallon. Natural gas sank 9 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.89 per 1,000 cubic feet.   Bond prices dipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.05 percent from 2.04 percent. Banks traded a bit higher. They had taken sharp losses on Thursday as bond yields and interest rates dropped.   The dollar fell to 107.76 yen from 108.46 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.2024 from $1.2018.     "
Finding Inspiration for Art in the Betrayal of Privacy,"Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine. Last month, a Berlin nonprofit group called the Tactical Technology Collective took over a gallery in Lower Manhattan. They installed wall-size screens and display cases and arranged glossy tablets on large tables. The walls were white, and the décor was minimalist. If you squinted, you could mistake it for an Apple Store. That was the point. The exhibit, which Mozilla helped produce, lured people in with the visual language of high-tech consumption. But instead of housing cool new devices, each display contained an artifact or a piece of art intended to school and shock visitors on how much (or little) we know about privacy and data security.  There was an interactive demonstration on a widely used program called ''Churchix,'' a facial-recognition tool licensed to churches that records and logs the identities of people entering the premises. There was a book created by the artist Aram Bartholl of the five million passwords stolen in 2012 from LinkedIn (including my own), so thoroughly thumbed through that the spine had broken. A piece by Mimi Onuoha, ''The Library of Missing Data Sets,'' showed a filing cabinet packed with information not readily available online, under headings like ''Number of Mosques Surveilled by F.B.I.'' and ''N.S.F.W. Comments Trump Made While Filming 'The Apprentice.' '' It commented on the political implications of the knowledge we don't have access to -- despite living in the age of on-demand information.    Eight antennas collected information emitted by any Wi-Fi-enabled device that happened to wander past the gallery and beamed it to an enormous screen inside, a disturbing reminder of how easy it is to track people and how often we let it happen. My favorite display was a fitness band tied to a metronome, exactly the kind you would use to practice music. Called an UnFitbit, the low-fi hack was intended to help clever individuals goose their daily fitness scores. It seemed cute, the idea that you might want to cheat on how many steps you took in a day, but the display had a darker interpretation: It anticipated a future when insurance rates and health benefits might be tied to such rankings.   To move through the Glass Room, as the exhibition was called, was to be reminded of the many ways we unwittingly submit ourselves and one another to unnecessary surveillance, with devastating consequences. ''A few years ago, everything here would be a 'Black Mirror' episode, but it is real,'' says Marek Tuszynski, a founder of the Tactical Technology Collective, which also does privacy and digital rights advocacy work. He told me that since the election, Americans have seemed more eager to protect their data. ''There is a newfound urgency here,'' he says. ''We don't want people to feel like they have to stop using Facebook or their mobile phones, but we just want them to look at it differently.''   I left the Glass Room invigorated by the ways artists are exploring the dark side of our digital footprint. Artists' obsessions with technology are not new, but in the late aughts, the work tended to focus on the possibility of the medium, treating technology like a new tool rather than a sociopolitical framework. Browser hacks scrambled web pages, turning them into distorted images, and Facebook-oriented projects treated the platform's design as Dadaist.   ''It was that early millennial era, when the 20-somethings were defining their generation by its use of technology and social media without raising questions about privacy, data or corporate power,'' says Joanne McNeil, an artist and a writer who often tackles topics relating to the intersection of art and technology. Her theory is that because many artists -- all of us, really -- were so captivated by the initial promise of the internet, they were blinded to its potential problems. ''I think because it was so much a networking tool -- they were friending curators, other artists -- Facebook seemed necessary, rather than an institution to distract or antagonize.''   In the earlier part of this decade, I myself fell prey to a similar infatuation. Technology impressed me so much that I didn't consider its implications. I remember once driving in 2007 out to Pacifica State Beach in California and spotting a billboard that advertised a free business directory from Google. Later that day, during a slow spell at the restaurant where I waitressed, I tried it. You dialed GOOG-411, and an automated service located the number you needed -- a hotel, a home, a nail salon -- and dialed it for you. It's hard to explain how impressive this was back then. Before smartphones and unlimited data plans became ubiquitous, GOOG-411 was an ingenious life saver, especially because it was free (its alternative, dialing 411, sometimes cost $2 or more per request). Google engineers were also using the service to help build a library of human sounds, in order to refine the company's speech-recognition system. Helping to build a robot seemed unbelievably cool at the time. But that was nearly 10 years ago, before I knew about all the ways in which seemingly innocuous data collection can turn insidious, how programs not so different from that directory have given rise to predictive policing, algorithmic biases and unthinkable privacy breaches.   Each day, it seems, we now learn about some new way our supposedly locked-down information is being leaked -- as happened recently at Yahoo, which lost control of millions of passwords. Terms of agreement are updated with disturbing details in the fine print. The maker of the note-taking application Evernote, for example, recently sent out a notice to its millions of users that its engineers would be looking at their data to improve its services. Although there was a way to opt out, the company warned that doing so could compromise future services. The outcry against the change forced the company to reconsider.   Artists now seem to be tangling with and reflecting these dark undertones in their work. Roddy Schrock, the director of Eyebeam, a space for new media, recently noted in an interview with an art blog how artists have changed their approach. ''Eyebeam was born at a time, in the late '90s, when thinking around technology was naïve and utopian,'' he said. ''I think much current thought around technology is still naïve, but no one even pretends that the outcomes will be utopic now.''   That lack of pretending is now readily apparent. Friends of mine who attended Art Basel in Miami posted photographs of works like the ''Social Security Cameras'' by Fidia Falaschetti, a series of security cameras whose outer casings had been replaced with the candy-colored logos of companies like Twitter, Google, Snapchat and Instagram. The cameras were a chilling reflection of our documentation-obsessed times, how our need for validation usurps our desire for privacy and the protection of personal information. Also at Basel was the work of a Shanghai artist who uses the handle Aaajiao, who installed a machine that printed out lists of websites blocked by China's firewall, reflecting the limits of the online experience in the country.   And the New Jersey-based artist Sondra Perry recently had an incredible show in the Kitchen, a Chelsea performance space, called ''Resident Evil'' that mixed video-game perspectives with bodycam and news footage that pushed visitors to think about how black bodies survive despite the threats posed by surveillance. Perry told an interviewer that she was invested in understanding how the power structures that govern the internet -- which has essentially become a group of corporations -- was shaping our sense of self and autonomy. ''When we think that we are trying to express ourselves, and we're being individuals,'' she said, ''we're being individuals within a frame that is primarily to collect our data and sell us stuff.''   Artists have long urged cultural introspection by creating work that forces awareness of our current political and economic landscape. A clip of Nina Simone speaking about art's power as activism has been floating around the web more vigorously than usual in the last few months. In it, Simone has an air of urgency. ''An artist's duty, as far as I'm concerned, is to reflect the times,'' she says. She continues: ''We will shape and mold this country, or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore.'' Art has the ability to be a mirror, reflecting back to us the world as it is, even if we're not ready to see it. Artists like Perry, Falaschetti and Onuoha are trying to awaken us from our complacency, pushing us to look beyond the blinding dazzle of our devices.

How to Handle India's Phone Swindlers? Readers Share Stories,"Mel Craig's 90-year-old father has been tormented over the past year by swindlers calling him at home, threatening him if he did not send them more money. ''Returned after a three-day trip to find receipts on the table for $300 worth of iTunes cards,'' wrote Ms. Craig, a New York Times commenter in Washington, D.C. ''Dad doesn't even know what iTunes is.''    More than 1,000 readers responded to Ellen Barry's recent article on a call center in India that is being investigated for fraud against Americans.   Many of the commenters, who responded on the article and on The Times's Facebook post, said they, too, had received calls from strangers demanding payments or personal information. Some expressed sympathy for those who are conned, and others voiced anger at the criminals and a system that seems to do little to protect the vulnerable.    Readers also shared their tactics for dealing with the calls.   ''Sometimes I give the scammer a made up credit card number one digit short of the full complement, then keep changing the sequence when they read it back,'' Bruce in Cleveland wrote. ''I can still make dinner while I'm doing this on speaker phone.''   Here is a selection of the responses. They have been edited and condensed.   Personal Experiences With Fraud   ''I thought I was impervious to scams since I had installed security software from a known, trusted company ('ABC').   ''Two months ago ABC sent me an email saying that I didn't have adequate protection on my system. The email asked me to download a new module to update my security package. Not even thinking remotely about potential problems with this approach, I did as they asked. But the module wouldn't install, and it gave me an error code and a number to call. Not only that, but I was called several times from someone claiming to be their representative who would help me with this problem. So I called them back and was connected to 'Chris Coleman,' a fellow with a deep accent who spoke broken English. 'Chris' told me he needed to 'take control' of my system to search for viruses. Long story short, I finally tumbled to the truth when Chris asked me for my credit card to 'buy' some new, improved security software!''   -- Thomas E. Heines in Dallas, who has worked in information technology   ''My 82-year-old mother, whose memory and judgment are fading, has been getting calls from 'Windows tech support' for a couple years. I keep telling her to just hang up, it's a scam, but she keeps talking to them. So far they only got $300, but last month there were a couple close calls. One guy took control of her computer and tried to have her sign up for online banking (she called me before they got any money). I am taking steps to limit her access to her money. This is the only way to protect someone like her from these awful scams.''   -- Eric Beldoch in Ardsley, N.Y.   ''Ashamed, for what the youth of my country has got themselves into. I hope such scammers are busted as early as possible. It's not just American citizens; international students are also targeted. My cousin was duped of 3,000 Australian dollars and another one of $4,000.''   -- Aryan Nair via Facebook   ''My 90-year-old father was tormented by these people for a year. He believed they were going to fix his computer, and he gave them his log in and password. And he paid them for lifetime service on his PC.   ''Then they started calling and threatening him to send more money. Said they would destroy his PC. I had Montgomery County police (in Maryland) come to the house and provided them the contact info. They said they see this all the time and there was 'nothing they could do.'   ''I told them I had contacted the F.T.C. but there was no one to speak with -- only a 'contact us' form -- as if that would help.   ''I begged Dad to stop answering the phone, but he didn't because he's lonely and that's what his generation does when the phone rings.   ''Returned after a three-day trip to find receipts on the table for $300 worth of iTunes cards. Dad doesn't even know what iTunes is.   ''So a feeling of total helplessness. No legal authority in this country is able to protect our elderly from this kind of fraud.''   -- Mel Craig in Washington   ''Being the victim of financial fraud is often one of the first signs that someone is suffering from this disease [dementia]. Caller ID is of no use to someone who is beginning to lose their faculties.   ''I watched my father deal with this on a daily basis for six years, screening phone calls, intercepting letters from fraudulent charities and contests (an average of about six per day), and doing other things to protect a relative with dementia.   ''One called back and told him to look out his front window; he was about to be killed by someone waiting outside.''   -- Richard Garner in Germantown Hills, Ill.   'Promoted if We Got Tough'   ''As a young man I was trained as a collections agent by a major retailer. I was taught all manner of tactics to get people to pay their bills. We were paid a bonus and promoted if we got tough. There was no Fair Debt Collections Practices Act then, but still there were laws and our employer taught us to ignore them. I helped set up call centers in Madras, Bangalore and Bombay, so far back those places still had those old names.   ''Over the years I've also interviewed for jobs in the U.S. that involve scamming people over the phone. Never took the job, though. This kind of fraud doesn't just originate overseas. We need a stronger Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, yet the president-elect wants to gut the office.''   -- Thomas. H. Williams in Annapolis, Md.   Sharing Defense Strategies   ''I do not ever, ever, ever answer a call from a number I don't recognize -- ever, not at home, not on my cell, not at work. If it's important, and genuine, the caller usually leaves a message, and I return the call if I choose.''   -- AMM in New York   ''One time, with one of these I.R.S. Treasury calls, I was particularly incensed, knowing that these scammers were going to victimize more gullible people. So I called them back, and lectured the guy who answered. He hung up. So I called back again -- and lucky me, the same guy answered the phone. Again, another lecture, and I worked to shame him as much as I could. He hung up.   ''Yeah, I called again -- and, again, the same guy. This time I pointed out to him the sad futility of his life, pointing out how he clearly had some basic skills -- good enunciation, good tone of voice -- and how he could be working a legitimate job if he wanted to, yet he was pursuing life as a scam artist. He broke down crying, saying he had to pay his bills. But he got no sympathy from me.''   -- Evelyn in Orlando   ''I was able to get the Microsoft scammers to stop by saying in a stern voice 'O.K., Detective -- you're on the line? This is the fraudulent call I want you to trace,' and pressing any button on the keypad, which emits a tone that sounds like the start of a recording.   ''I am convinced they target older people, thinking we are too stupid to realize these are phony calls.''   -- Ellen D. Murphy in Portland, Me.   ''I get the 'Microsoft Support' calls fairly regularly. The usual pitch, 'We have detected that your PC is infected ...' My response is to play along: 'Oh, no! No, I am not in front of my PC right now ...,' 'I'm going to put the phone down while my PC boots up ...'   ''Then I just put the phone down. I wait until I hear the scammer shouting themselves hoarse for me to come back to the phone.   ''Then I ask them if their mother knows that they are working as a scammer. That's when they curse and hang up.''   -- Jeff in the Slope in New York   ''The approach I use when receiving such scamming phone calls is to say: Please give me your phone number and location, and I will have my attorney call you.''   -- MNW in Connecticut   ''It happens in Canada, too. I was getting dozens of calls a day -- really annoying as I work from home a lot. I let them go to voice mail except for once where I told the guy where to go. OMG! He really got mad. We're urged to report such incidents to the police. However, nothing stops it.''   -- Joan Morrissey via Facebook   ''Got a call from an Andrew McGowen, supposedly an F.B.I. agent informing me that my I.R.S. tax issues will cause me to be arrested in the next 24 hours if I did not send a gift card loaded with $2,500 immediately. His heavily accented English didn't seem right for someone of Irish heritage.   ''Having a little fun, I wasted as much of his time as I could, ending with a question: 'How is the weather in Mumbai today?' Silence.''   -- Ken in Mont Vernon, N.H.   Sullying India's Reputation   ''Every week I get two or three early-morning scam calls from India, and I am sick of them. I get either the I.R.S. scam or the Microsoft computer virus scam. They have given me very negative feelings toward India.''   -- Mary Ann Hymel in Bellevue, Wash.   ''When I hear an Indian voice on the phone, I immediately distrust whoever it is. That is sad. These people are doing no service for their own country. They are giving India a bad reputation.''   -- Elizabeth in Washington   Reflections on the Fraud   ''What struck me most in this article is the statement that he made about Americans fearing their government. That was profound to me. And it speaks to the very reason why people fall for these scams. We shouldn't fear being taxed to the point that when you receive calls like this, you immediately think of everything you will lose.''   -- Crystal Means via Facebook   ''I was the lucky recipient of probably 100 of these calls over several years, and I watched the scam evolve, with interest. At first, it was laughable: Guys with heavy accents, claiming to be 'Steve Martin' (seriously?), using language that was very British-influenced and awkward-sounding. After about three years, the caller became an educated sounding Indian woman, with the language and agency names considerably cleaned up. Then, the messages became computer generated so no accents and no names.   ''I think we're unlikely to get smarter, but they can only get better at scamming.''   -- Mosselyn in Silicon Valley   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

IBM Bets Big on the Arcane Idea Behind Bitcoin,"Frank Yiannas has spent years looking in vain for a better way to track lettuce, steaks and snack cakes from farm and factory to the shelves of Walmart, where he is the vice president for food safety. When the company dealt with salmonella outbreaks, it often took weeks to trace where the bad ingredients came from. Then, last year, IBM executives flew to Walmart's headquarters in Arkansas to propose a solution: the blockchain.    As Mr. Yiannas studied their pitch, he said, ''I became increasingly convinced that maybe we were onto the holy grail.''    The blockchain -- the buzzy, bewildering technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin -- is starting to be applied to real-world problems like tracking pork chops, shipping containers and footwear with a speed and security not currently possible. The IBM-Walmart partnership is one of the biggest practical tests to date.   At its heart, blockchain simply refers to a bookkeeping method that ''chains'' together entries so that they are very difficult to modify later. It provides a way for large groups of unrelated companies to jointly keep a secure and reliable record of their transactions.   IBM is trying to position itself at the forefront of the heated competition for practical uses of this arcane idea. Walmart is just one of 400 IBM clients testing it out, and IBM now has around 650 employees dedicated to the technology.   The most immediate business opportunities are in the financial world as a tool to track and trade stocks, bonds and other assets. But in the next week, Maersk, the global shipping giant, is expected to announce it is using IBM's version of the blockchain to track the avocados, flowers and machine parts it carries on its enormous cargo ships. Last month, the government of Dubai said it was working with IBM to trace the goods flowing through its ports.   Yet success is far from assured.   Rival Microsoft said this past week that it was working with JPMorgan Chase and several other corporate giants on a system that competes against IBM's, based on the virtual currency network known as Ethereum. Many banks are concerned that IBM could push them into a version of the blockchain that would lock them into IBM's software.   ''We believe with 100 percent certainty that it's going to matter,'' Mark Russinovich, the head of Microsoft's blockchain efforts, said of the technology. ''It's a question of where's its going to matter and how it's going to matter.''   Trust in Transactions   It was Bitcoin that first caught the attention of IBM researchers, and everyone else.   Bitcoin, born in 2009, represented a novel idea in the financial world. Unlike, say, dollars or yen, Bitcoins are virtual tokens, unaffiliated with any nation. Anyone can open a wallet and receive Bitcoins -- without providing any identifying information -- and transactions are recorded on a universal ledger that is visible to everyone.   Drug dealers have embraced its relative anonymity. And people who live in countries that strictly control their financial systems, like China and Venezuela, have used Bitcoin to store their money beyond the watchful eye of the government.   But while the public focused on stories like these, geeks became fascinated with Bitcoin's underlying structure and the communal way in which it was updated. That database was referred to as the blockchain because all the transactions were sorted into ''blocks,'' and each block was chained, using sophisticated math, to the ones before it, all the way back to the very first transaction -- a structure that makes it tough for anyone to change the records after the fact.   In 2014, a handful of IBM employees began building their own version of Bitcoin, known as Blue Coin, which could be used to track financial transactions, totally independent of Bitcoin. But it was a small, exploratory project with no real support inside IBM.   ''I was prepared to tell them to shut it down, that cybercurrency is not our role to play,'' said Arvind Krishna, director of research at IBM.   But a team kept working on the technology, changing the name to Bluechain and then to Openchain. And Mr. Krishna eventually invited his team to a meeting at IBM's central lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., for one last chance to defend the technology.   They explained that this was about more than just a currency -- it was a new way of tracking shipments and transactions in supply chains of all kinds, from food to prescription drugs to diamonds. Because all the participants would be keeping their own live version of all the data, without a central authority, they could immediately see everything that was going on and trust that no one else had tampered with it.   ''That was the 'aha' for me,'' Mr. Krishna said. ''This was not really about digital payments, but establishing trust in transactions in general.'' He called it ''a technology that can change the world.''   There are still many in the industry who are skeptical of the long-term significance of the blockchain concept. Doubters have said that it is, at best, a slightly more reliable way to track data, and at worst, a much less efficient method of keeping data than current ones that rely on central gatekeepers.   But blockchain champions like to compare it to the significance of the internet, which provided a universal computing language for communicating seamlessly among networks. The blockchain, they say, could provide that universal language for valuable data and information.   A few months after Mr. Krishna's aha moment, his team presented the idea at an annual gathering where IBM's top executives consider new technologies that could be major opportunities -- or threats -- to IBM's business. Blockchain was the first subject of discussion, and the first that Virginia Rometty, IBM's chief executive, gave the green light to.   She turned to Mr. Krishna, the research chief, and said, ''You run with this,'' he recalled. She asked for a working version within two months.   Her hurry-up response was a reflection, in part, of IBM's eagerness to find new businesses to make up for the erosion of its traditional hardware, software and services offerings. The company has made progress with new products like data-analysis software and its Watson artificial intelligence software.   But growth in new businesses has not yet offset declines in traditional businesses. In January, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarterly drop in revenue, though some of that sales retreat was because of profit-draining operations the company sold off, like semiconductor manufacturing and industry-standard server computers.   IBM has already suffered from being late to one of the biggest trends in technology today, cloud computing, where it moved slowly at first and watched the early market leadership go to Amazon and Microsoft. Today, Mr. Krishna said, ''The first-mover advantage is even more important than it used to be.''   After getting Ms. Rometty's push on the blockchain, the IBM team's first move was to make its software ''open source,'' meaning that it would be free and available for anyone to review and tinker with. IBM's bet was that this would establish its technology as a de facto standard, and that it could make money by selling software and services that would sit on top of the technology.   It was the chairman of IBM Europe, Erich Clementi, who personally pitched the concept to the top technology executive at Maersk. Like Walmart, Maersk had already been looking for years for a better way to trace the goods it ships around the globe.   For Maersk, the problem was not tracking the familiar rectangular shipping containers that sail the world aboard its cargo ships -- instead, it was the mountains of paperwork that go with each container. Maersk had found that a single container could require stamps and approvals from as many as 30 people, including customs, tax officials and health authorities.   While the containers themselves can be loaded on a ship in a matter of minutes, a container can be held up in port for days because a piece of paper goes missing, while the goods inside spoil. The cost of moving and keeping track of all this paperwork often equals the cost of physically moving the container around the world.   What's more, the system is rife with fraud. The valuable bill of lading is often tampered with or copied to let criminals siphon off goods or circulate counterfeit products, leading to billions of dollars in maritime fraud each year.   Maersk and IBM began working on a version of its software that would be open to everyone involved with every container. When customs authorities signed off on a document, they could immediately upload a copy of it, with a digital signature, so that everyone else involved -- including Maersk and government authorities -- could see that it was complete. If there were disputes later, everyone could go back to the record and be confident that no one had altered it in the meantime. The cryptography involved would make it hard for the virtual signatures to be forged.   The first test of the system happened last summer and tracked all of the paperwork related to a container of flowers moving from the Port of Mombasa in Kenya to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It went well enough that Maersk and IBM followed up by tracking containers with pineapples from Colombia, and mandarin oranges from California.   The difficulty of making this work in the real world is that everyone at every step along the way needs to be involved, otherwise it's unlikely to induce any more confidence than the old system.   ''You need to have something in it for all stakeholders, in order to get the whole chain going,'' said Jakob Stausholm, the chief financial and technology officer at Maersk, who is leading the project. ''That's the difficult part.''   IBM and Maersk have recently been seeking cooperation from customs authorities, freight forwarders and the producers that fill the containers. Just last month, Maersk and IBM began running their first trials with these partners involved, on shipping routes between Rotterdam and Newark.   A Question of Control   Not everyone has been so willing to buy in to the IBM approach.   Many technologists who got excited about Bitcoin have said that the newer, corporate-designed blockchains -- like the one being built by IBM -- are missing one of the main elements of Bitcoin's success, namely the extremely decentralized structure. Anyone in the world can join Bitcoin and, in effect, study its ledgers. But only a limited set of participants can gain access to ones like IBM's.   That could make them more vulnerable to attack from, say, a hacker who targets a few of the participants. Even though the IBM technology for tracking shipments is more decentralized than previous methods, ''it still concentrates power in a handful of entities,'' said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell who studies distributed systems.   The companies working with IBM have been less worried about these security issues. Almost all of them demanded that the system not be open like Bitcoin. While they are giving up some security benefits, the private blockchains can move faster than Bitcoin, which has been plagued by delays.   IBM has faced questions from companies worried that the tech giant has too much control over the system it is building and could make them dependent on IBM software for years to come.   IBM tried to fend off this line of attack when it made its software open source in 2015. The foundation that is now in charge of the computer code, the Hyperledger Foundation, has attracted many other companies that are now working on the project alongside IBM. Just in the past week, the Bank of England, Kaiser Permanente and nine other new members joined.   But the director of the Hyperledger Foundation, Brian Behlendorf, acknowledged that IBM is still the single largest contributor to the project. As a result, it has been an uphill battle to convince others that it is not simply an IBM project.   ''They have such a head start that it can leave the impression that Hyperledger is an IBM product,'' Mr. Behlendorf said. ''We are trying to tell a story about the other companies building on top of Hyperledger. That is emerging. It will take some time.''   Microsoft has fended off this sort of problem by focusing most of its efforts on a blockchain that it had nothing to do with building, the blockchain behind the virtual currency known as Ethereum. This has already helped Microsoft move in on some clients that IBM is also pursuing. Bank of America, for instance, is building a system with Microsoft that will track the flows of money around trade deals.   But IBM has taken an early lead. Its list of collaborators includes the likes of the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of Tokyo, and lots of companies outside the financial world like Maersk and Walmart. ''This is the most well-thought-out project in the space,'' said Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor.   Now all IBM has to do is get the systems out into the real world and show that they work.   At Maersk, Mr. Stausholm said it could take five or even 10 years for that to happen, given all the partners -- manufacturers, customs officials and farmers -- that need to come together. ''I really do believe in it,'' he said, ''but I don't know how fast it will be able to take off.''   At Walmart, Mr. Yiannas is more optimistic. His company has already completed two pilots with IBM -- moving pork from Chinese farms to Chinese stores, and produce from Latin America to the United States -- and he is confident a finished version can be put together within a few years. ''I think this is our one best hope for getting it right,'' he said.     "
S.E.C. Rejects Plan for E.T.F. Tied to Bitcoin,"The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday it had rejected an application to create an exchange-traded fund tied to the price of Bitcoin. Within a few minutes of S.E.C.'s announcement, the price of a single Bitcoin tumbled more than 15 percent, to around $1,060. The price soon recovered some of the lost ground, however.    The decision was a significant setback for Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, twin brothers who began working on a proposed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or E.T.F., four years ago. An exchange-traded fund tracks an index, or basket, of assets but trades like a stock.    The commission said it was rejecting the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust because the markets where Bitcoin are currently traded are largely unregulated.   The lack of such regulation, the commission said, raised ''concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this market.''   The price of Bitcoin has climbed sharply in recent weeks in anticipation of the commission approving the Winklevoss brothers' fund, with the price of a single Bitcoin surging to a record high above $1,300.   Bitcoin aficionados had hoped that an exchange-traded fund would help bring the virtual currency into the mainstream by making it available to retail investors through brokerage firms like Charles Schwab and eTrade.   Several other companies have also applied to operate Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, and the S.E.C. could reach a different decision on those proposed funds. But the commission's broad concern about the unregulated nature of Bitcoin markets suggests that an approval may be unlikely in the near future.   ''It seems as if the other E.T.F.s in the pipeline for the S.E.C. are facing the same stone wall,'' Charles Hayter, founder of the virtual currency data provider CryptoCompare, said on Friday.   The commission wrote in its decision that Bitcoin was ''still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated Bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop.''   The commission added that it could reconsider a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund if more mature markets developed.   Tyler Winklevoss said that he and his brother were not giving up on the exchange-traded fund.   ''We began this journey almost four years ago, and are determined to see it through,'' he said. ''We agree with the S.E.C. that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investors.''   The twins rose to fame through their legal tussles with Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook.   More recently, the brothers have bought  significant quantities of Bitcoin and have dedicated themselves to promoting the virtual currency and bringing it into the mainstream.   The twins already won regulatory approval from New York authorities for their Gemini Exchange, where virtual currencies can be bought and sold by professional traders. The proposed E.T.F. would have been tied to the price of Bitcoin on the exchange.   Most Bitcoin, however, are traded outside the United States, beyond the reach of American regulators. The virtual currency emerged in 2009 and was celebrated for its ability to circumvent government authorities.   Since then, Bitcoin has gained prominence partly because of its use on shadowy online black markets, where it is exchanged for drugs, and in countries like China and Venezuela, where some citizens are looking to evade government oversight.   Over time, it has become clear that Bitcoin's growth prospects are probably limited if it is not easily available through regulated institutions to ordinary investors.   Jerry Brito, executive director of the Coin Center, a virtual currency advocacy group, said that the S.E.C.'s decision presented a problem for the further development of the technology.   ''How do we develop well-capitalized and regulated markets in the U.S. and Europe if financial innovators aren't allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like Bitcoin?'' Mr. Brito said in a statement on Friday.   Many large financial institutions have mostly declined to invest significant resources into Bitcoin, because of the regulatory questions that surround it.   But the same institutions have been showing a great deal of interest in the technological concept introduced by Bitcoin, known as the blockchain, which presents a new way of keeping track of all types of information.

Ask the Sketch Guy: Should I Finally Buy Some Bitcoin?,"Carl Richards, a certified financial planner, is the author of ''The Behavior Gap'' and ''The One-Page Financial Plan.'' His sketches and essays appear weekly. Have a question for him? You can submit it here. Follow him on Twitter: @behaviorgap Last week, I announced the beginning of a semiregular ''Ask the Sketch Guy'' service. Send me your questions, but not just any questions. I want to explore the deep, dark conversations that we don't hear on the financial pornography network, like how we feel about money and how money makes us feel.  To kick off things, Shawn Cook from San Diego asked a question about Bitcoin. (For an explainer on Bitcoin, see this article by Nathaniel Popper of The New York Times, who literally wrote the book on the topic.) His hipster friend is constantly bugging him to invest in the cryptocurrency. It's making Shawn wonder: Should he ditch his boring old index fund?    Shawn, this is a great question because who among us doesn't have a hipster friend who is always talking about how he is killing it with his investments in Bitcoin, Apple and Tesla? Those people have all the fun! They seem to know exactly what's going to happen in whatever market they're investing in and have this aura of self-assurance that is really annoying. It's enough to cause even the most rational, non-hip among us to doubt our boring, old-style investing.   In fact, I remember feeling a bit this way back in 1999. I was surrounded by tech people with their BlackBerries and Hotmail accounts. I resisted the siren call of the Nasdaq and the technology bubble -- until I finally gave in. Then, I took some hard-earned money out of a boring diversified investment and bought Infospace.   Remember that? If you do, it may not be pleasant. In fact, I can't remember the exact details because they're too painful, but I know I invested a lot of money (for me) back then. When I sold, I didn't have enough to pay for a burrito and a Coke. I even considered buying more on ''the dip.'' Except I didn't have any more money to invest, and this wasn't a dip. The stock never recovered to anything close to what I had paid to buy it. Today, I still have the stock certificate as a reminder of that valuable lesson.   So, Shawn, the moral of the story is that your friend just might be right. But then again, he might be flat-out wrong.   What he is talking about is speculation at best, and it's probably closer to gambling. If you have some spare money and you feel like gambling, fire away.   But here's an alternative idea. Keep your low-cost, boring, diversified investments, and have a T-shirt made (black, with white text) that says: ''I own Bitcoin. How you like me now?'' I'll even provide the sketch.   Keep the questions coming via your voice messages!     "
Drug Trade Rises In Dark Corners Of the Internet,"As the nation's opioid crisis worsens, the authorities are confronting a resurgent, unruly player in the illicit trade of the deadly drugs, one that threatens to be even more formidable than the cartels. The internet.    In a growing number of arrests and overdoses, law enforcement officials say, the drugs are being bought online. Internet sales have allowed powerful synthetic opioids such as fentanyl -- the fastest-growing cause of overdoses nationwide -- to reach living rooms in nearly every region of the country, as they arrive in small packages in the mail.   The authorities have been frustrated in their efforts to crack down on the trade because these sites generally exist on the so-called dark web, where buyers can visit anonymously using special browsers and make purchases with virtual currencies like Bitcoin.   The problem of dark web sales appeared to have been stamped out in 2013, when the authorities took down the most famous online marketplace for drugs, known as Silk Road. But since then, countless successors have popped up, making the drugs readily available to tens of thousands of customers who would not otherwise have had access to them.    Among the dead are two 13-year-olds, Grant Seaver and Ryan Ainsworth, who died last fall in the wealthy resort town of Park City, Utah, after taking a synthetic opioid known as U-47700 or Pinky. The boys had received the powder from another local teenager, who bought the drugs on the dark web using Bitcoin, according to the Park City police chief.   ''It's unimaginable that Grant could gain access to a drug like Pinky so easily, and be gone so quickly, poof,'' said Jim Seaver, Grant's father. ''The pain and brutality of this tragedy is crippling.''   Largely because of their potency, synthetic opioids have become the fastest-growing cause of the overdose epidemic, overtaking heroin in some areas. Just a few flakes of fentanyl can be fatal.   Their deadly efficiency also makes them ideal for sale online. Unlike heroin and prescription painkillers, which are relatively bulky, enough fentanyl to get nearly 50,000 people high can fit in a standard first-class envelope.   Dark net drug markets first gained attention six years ago with the rise of Silk Road, the online market created by Ross Ulbricht. Mr. Ulbricht was arrested and the site taken down in late 2013, but imitators quickly proliferated.   No federal agencies have released data on the prevalence of drugs ordered online. But the leading sites are doing far more business than the original Silk Road, according to findings by RAND Europe and researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.   The authorities say these markets account for a small proportion of the overall traffic in most drugs, including heroin and cocaine. But when it comes to synthetic opioids, many authorities tracking the traffic say that dark web markets have quickly assumed a more prominent and frightening role.   The dark web ''has become such an important source of distribution for this sort of deadly drug,'' said Kathryn Haun, who was a prosecutor in San Francisco until last month, and the Justice Department's first Digital Currency Coordinator. ''It has enabled distribution channels that previously didn't exist.''   As of Friday, the leading dark net market, AlphaBay, had more than 21,000 listings for opioids and more than 4,100 for fentanyl and similar drugs, from dozens of dealers large and small. Many of those individual listings are like items in a catalog, representing an endless back-room supply of pills, powders and nasal sprays.   Just last month, the federal authorities announced charges against a six-person operation in Utah that was purchasing fentanyl in bulk from China on the dark web and then pressing the powder into pills and selling the pills on the dark web to users in the United States.   The authorities said the group had sold hundreds of thousands of these pills, often marketed as less dangerous drugs like Xanax and Oxycodone.   The alleged ringleader of the operation, Aaron Shamo, was identified by many AlphaBay users as the vendor known as Pharma-Master, who had 8,332 verified sales on the site.   The social forums on AlphaBay and other sites are filled with conversations about how potent the drugs are, with frequent mentions of trips that ended up in emergency room visits or blackouts.   ''I was injecting slowly got 1/3rd of the hit in, next thing i know i wake up with 3 paramedics above me,'' a user named AgentOrange 007 wrote in a forum posting on AlphaBay. ''If i hadn't been found because i was making a loud snoring sound (tongue rolled back in my throat) i'd be dead no doubt.''   Court documents show that in the last year, there have been more than two dozen arrests of American drug dealers who were operating significant operations buying or selling synthetic opioids online, most of which were tied to specific overdose deaths.   In late February, a man in South Carolina was accused of receiving more than three kilograms of fentanyl ordered on the dark net -- or enough to kill 1.5 million adults, given that just two milligrams is a lethal dose.   A few weeks later in New Jersey, authorities arrested Chukwuemeka Okparaeke, who allegedly went by the screen name of Fentmaster on AlphaBay. He had received two kilograms of fentanyl from an address in Hong Kong, according to a criminal complaint.   Then in April, a Cleveland man, Alec Steinberger, 21, was arrested and accused of receiving a package of furanyl fentanyl that he was preparing to sell on the streets. He is said to have texted a 19-year-old who was helping him distribute the drugs to warn about their strength.   ''Bro I did it last night any my pupils got so small they disappeared and then I was nodding for 18 hrs,'' the text said, according to the indictment.   When the 19-year-old tried the drugs, he overdosed and died.   Mr. Okparaeke, Mr. Steinberger and Mr. Shamo have all pleaded not guilty. Lawyers for the men had no comment on their cases.   Law enforcement officials investigating these cases say that public documents underrepresent the number of cases involving the dark web because many court documents don't mention the online sources of the drugs.   And many cases -- including the death last year of the musician Prince from a fentanyl overdose -- are still being investigated because of the relatively recent advent of the phenomenon.   ''It has come to play a key role in the overdose crisis,'' said Tim Plancon, who oversees the Drug Enforcement Administration in Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio, states at the epicenter of the overdose crisis. ''It's expanded beyond just your traditional drug smuggling and trafficking. There is just a lot more involved with it when you are dealing with folks on the dark web with virtual currencies.''   The United States is not the only country dealing with an influx of mail-order synthetic opioids. Canada and several European countries have also made recent arrests of suspects accused of being major online drug dealers responsible for multiple deaths.   But the numbers are particularly staggering in America. In 2015, the last year for which national data is available, fentanyl and similar drugs killed 9,580 people, or 73 percent more than 2014. The number of deaths rose even faster last year in areas that have released figures, such as Ohio and New Hampshire. Over all, deaths from drug overdoses are soaring in the United States, and most likely exceeded 59,000 last year.   Authorities say that most of the illicit supply of synthetic opioids is produced in labs in Asia and especially China, where many of the precursor chemicals are either legal or easier to procure.   Latin American drug cartels are also getting synthetic opioids from Asia and moving them into the United States. But the operational ease of sending the drugs through the mail gives the method obvious appeal for Chinese producers, many of whom are technologically skilled enough to set up their own dark web shops.   One of the most frequently reviewed vendors of synthetic opioids on AlphaBay goes by the screen name BenzoChems. The vendor has shared online videos of his operations in China.   In a series of messages exchanged on AlphaBay's internal messaging system, BenzoChems, who declined to provide his real name, said he had found that routing packages through Hong Kong, and then through the United States Postal Service, was the most efficient method of transit.   Some Chinese producers also list synthetic opioids for sale on websites on the ordinary internet, without requiring users to navigate to them through a special dark web browser. But most of the recent criminal complaints in the United States appear to involve drugs procured through markets that exist only on the dark web.   BenzoChems said that he had sold his products on ordinary websites, but those sites were quickly shut down by the authorities.   Dark web technology was originally developed by American intelligence agencies to allow for encrypted communication. News organizations, including The New York Times, use it to receive story tips from vulnerable sources.   But the illicit markets enabled by the dark web have made stopping the flow of deadly drugs much more complicated than it was when the authorities were trying to stop earlier waves of drug overdoses.   ''We could give you a pretty good idea of the drug traffickers in town who can order kilos from Mexico -- that's a known commodity,'' said Joseph M. Pinjuh, the chief of the organized crime task force in the United States attorney's office in Cleveland. ''What's harder to track is the person ordering this from his grandmother's basement.''   Lawmakers have tried to attack the problem by introducing legislation in Congress that would tighten the requirements on information gathered by the Postal Service. Last month,  at a Senate hearing on the problem, Postal Service officials said they were working to collect information on more packages coming from China.   In recent months, though, the number of listings for fentanyl on AlphaBay and other dark web sites has been rising steadily.   Ms. Haun, the former federal prosecutor in San Francisco, said the tools that enabled dark web commerce made it very unlikely that the expanding traffic would be curtailed anytime soon.   ''It's only going to increase, and increase the types of communities and markets that might not have had as easy access to it before,'' she said.     "
"In Digital Coins, Bypassing Rules As You Get Rich","A new crop of technology entrepreneurs is forgoing the usual routes to raising money. The entrepreneurs are not pitching venture capitalists, selling stock in an initial public offering or using crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter. Instead, before they even have a working product, they are creating their own digital currencies and selling so-called coins on the web, sometimes raising tens of millions of dollars in a matter of minutes.    The pitch is that once the products are up and running, the currencies -- with names like BAT, Mysterium and Siacoin -- will be redeemable for services like data storage or anonymous internet access, and could appreciate in value in the meantime.   Known as initial coin offerings, this latest twist in online fund-raising has made it easier than ever for entrepreneurs to raise large sums of money without dealing with the hassles of regulators, investor protections or accountants.    Since the beginning of the year, 65 projects have raised $522 million in these offerings, according to Smith & Crown, a research firm focused on the new industry.   It is a frothy, sprawling and completely unregulated way of funding start-ups, leaving even veteran technology watchers scratching their heads.   ''It's kind of like when you are a little kid and you know you are getting away with something,'' said Chris Burniske, an industry analyst at ARK Invest. ''It's not going to last forever, but it's fun in the interim. The space is giddy right now.''   Last month, a small team of computer engineers in Lithuania raised $14 million in 45 minutes by selling a coin, known as Mysterium, that is intended to give access to an encrypted online data service that is still being built.   The next day, a group of coders in the Bay Area pulled in $35 million in under 30 seconds of online fund-raising. The coders were offering Basic Attention Tokens, which will one day work on a new kind of ad-free web browser.   Then this week, a team in Switzerland raised around $100 million for a coin that will be used on an online chat program that has not yet been released, known as Status.   Proponents of initial coin offerings hail them as a financial innovation that empowers developers and gives early investors a chance to share in the profits of a successful new enterprise. But where some see a new method of crowdfunding online projects, critics say the phenomenon is ripe for abuse and, in many cases, a violation of American securities law.   ''It's exploitative and abusive of the investing public,'' Preston Byrne, a technology lawyer specializing in virtual currencies, said about the offerings.   Last year, the first blockbuster coin offering, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, quickly raised more than $150 million. But the project blew up after a hacker manipulated the code and stole more than $50 million worth of digital currency. A number of other projects since then have been labeled scams.   Even among supporters, many say there has been too much money pouring into unproven projects in recent months.   Fred Wilson, a founder of the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, said he was ''long term very bullish'' on these new digital currencies. But he said, ''We see many reasons to be cautious right now.''   ''There is a gold rush mentality in the sector right now and many people are doing the wrong things for the wrong reasons,'' he said.   Underpinning the surge in initial coin offerings is a broader boom in digital money. Bitcoin and Ether, two of the most popular virtual currencies, have soared in value in recent months. And when entrepreneurs sell new coins, they are asking for payment in Bitcoin or Ether, not United States dollars.   This means that conventional banks and financial institutions are essentially shut out, allowing initial coin offerings to take place beyond the control of regulators.   Among the people tossing their money into the pot is Pete Sussman, 27, a software developer at a St. Louis company called Fusion Marketing.   Mr. Sussman began with around $800 worth of Bitcoin, which he earned selling art and blog posts online. He used his Bitcoin first to invest in a project called BitShares. Then he bought into the Ethereum virtual currency, Ether. As the value of Ether soared over the last year, Mr. Sussman got a return of 1,000 percent on his original money.   In March, he used his Ether to buy a new virtual currency known as GNT, which was created as part of a project known as Golem, based in Poland. The value of GNT has jumped 3,000 percent in recent months, pushing the value of Mr. Sussman's digital currency to over $200,000.   Along with GNT, other new tokens including Ark, Antshares and Spectrecoin have appreciated by more than 6,000 percent since they were issued.   Mr. Sussman has also had some bad moments along the way, such as the time that he sent what would now be $100,000 worth of Ether to a scammer who put up a fake digital address for another coin offering.   ''I was at work. I went to the bathroom and I tried to throw up but nothing came out,'' Mr. Sussman said. ''Then after a little bit, I went home and sulked.''   When he told his co-workers about the experience, they did not warn him off the investments. Instead, they became excited about the trend. Now, half a dozen of his colleagues, including his boss, have a chat room where they discuss potential coin investments.   The projects selling coins come in several forms. Some are straightforward start-ups that design their coins like stock, with promised dividend payments if the company does well. Others are Bitcoin or Ethereum knockoffs, which the inventors sell in advance before launching to the public.   But most of the prominent projects are not traditional start-ups. Instead, the programmers are building online services similar to Wikipedia, which are intended to be open source and owned by no one.   The coins will become the internal payment method on these services once they are built -- paying for computing power in the case of Golem, or file storage with a project called Storj. The sale of the coins will be used to compensate the programmers.   Even some well-established Silicon Valley names are using coins to raise funds. Brendan Eich, a co-founder of the Mozilla web browser project, is developing a new browser called Brave.   It was Mr. Eich who raised $35 million in just 30 seconds by selling millions of Basic Attention Tokens, or BAT, in late May. People using the Brave browser will be able to use their BAT to view web pages ad-free, and companies will be able to pay viewers for looking at ads. (The New York Times and other publishers have called Brave's ad-blocking technology illegal.)   The hope with a token like BAT is that as more people use the browser and more advertisers want the coins, the coins will become more sought after and the users will benefit from the rising price. These so-called network effects can also encourage users to get their friends to use a service.   Mr. Eich said he was anticipating that all the people holding tokens ''will drive millions of users to join our ecosystem.''   That is the dream. For now, several projects are raising millions without even having any computer code to test. And because of the lack of investor protections, the projects remain vulnerable to the whims of entrepreneurs, who could run away with their quick hauls of digital currency.   The most immediate problems could arise if regulators decide that the tokens being sold are unregistered securities, a violation of the law. An official with the Securities and Exchange Commission suggested at a conference last month that the agency was aware of the potential for problems and was looking at the market.   For at least some investors, such as Mr. Sussman, the possibility of big losses is the flip side of the big gains, and part of the allure.   ''It's very Wild West,'' he said. ''It's very easy to get into a situation where you can send things to a scammer very easily, and there is no recourse for it. That's kind of the beauty of it, too.''     "
A Test for the Market in Initial Coin Offerings,"The ballooning market for so-called initial coin offerings -- which has boomed to $1.3 billion so far this year -- just got a reality check.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has decided that the largest sale of cryptocurrency tokens last year, reminiscent of an initial public offering of shares, was indeed a sale of securities and should have complied with United States laws governing the process and protecting investors.    This time, the regulator is letting off the hook the blockchain experts behind the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which raised $150 million in ether, the digital currency of the Ethereum platform. But the Wall Street watchdog's report, released on Tuesday, sends a strong signal to the initial coin offering market and should deflate what was looking like an issuance bubble.   The regulator did not announce a broad crackdown, but it made clear that when coin offerings are similar enough to securities offerings, they fall under registration, disclosure and other requirements that apply to stock and bond issues. The D.A.O. episode had a particular twist in that more than a third of the proceeds was stolen by hackers, but that is largely beside the point. As well as alerting issuers about regulations, the commission warned investors to be wary.   Coin practitioners had been awaiting an official ruling. The regulator's report will surely crimp the market for a time. But much remains uncertain. It may be that blockchain start-ups needing funds will find that, with the additional red tape, coin offerings do not provide much, if any, advantage over crowdfunding, venture capital or even traditional initial public offerings of stock.   On the other hand, the technology surrounding cryptocurrencies is potentially powerful, and even for funding purposes it may have certain advantages over cash. The test for those who believe in it will be in turning a questionable fund-raising market into one that is both legitimate and useful.   Timur Onder is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

What Jamie Dimon Is Missing About Bitcoin,"JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is the most successful banker of his generation. He has successfully navigated a challenging environment over more than a decade, and his firm is stronger than ever. So naturally, given his status and success, his recent comments that Bitcoin was a ''fraud'' were taken seriously.    Mr. Dimon's comments may have come as a surprise to the dozens of employees at his bank working on projects related to blockchain, the bookkeeping technology underpinning digital currencies. And the comments must have been especially jarring to those employees who  were holding a forum for hedge funds interested in Bitcoin-- whose market value stood at about $70 billion at that moment.    It's no secret that Bitcoin and other digital currencies may dramatically fall in value at any time. How can an asset whose value jumps by 20 percent some days, and which no one can accurately value, plausibly not also suffer huge declines?   But that's a long way from Bitcoin being a worthless fraud.   While we are still in the early stages of digital currencies, and much can still go wrong, Mr. Dimon's rationale for his negativity was curious. His core problem with Bitcoin? ''You can't have a business where people are going to invent a currency out of thin air,'' he said.   Yet as one of the world's foremost bankers, Mr. Dimon is plainly aware that countries also create fiat currencies out of thin air. (In Latin, fiat means ''let it be done.'') It has been more than four decades since Richard Nixon removed the American dollar from the gold standard.   And in any event, most of gold's value doesn't arise from its physical attributes, since it doesn't have any magical ability to create usefulness or generate financial dividends despite its attractive shiny yellow hue. It's instead because investors have believed in its value for thousands of years.   Of course, fiat currencies like the dollar have the backing of a sovereign nation. Digital currencies are obviously far more speculative, have been around for only a few years, and don't have a government's underlying support. But almost all currencies today are conjured up from nothing -- the euro didn't even exist 20 years ago -- and their value is largely dependent on trust.   Naturally, most people have more trust in the ''full faith and credit of the United States'' than in an anonymous distributed group of miners and traders. But trust in digital currency is clearly building over time and is a self-reinforcing network. And one of the advantages of Bitcoin is that its total supply is fixed. A fiat currency, on the other hand, can be devalued by centralized monetary policy.   In his comments, Mr. Dimon cited the famed investor Howard Marks, who in a July memo to his clients referred to Bitcoin as an unfounded fad. But he seems to have missed Mr. Marks's subsequent backflip in which, while remaining a skeptic, the hedge fund mogul wrote, ''There's absolutely no reason why Bitcoin -- or anything else -- can't serve as a currency if enough people accept it as such.''   Mr. Dimon is also too modest about JPMorgan's own achievements in this arena. His firm conjured up its own currency: Chase Ultimate Reward points, its credit card loyalty program. Millions of customers have accumulated billions of points, trusting in Chase's promise that this currency can be converted into cash or used for travel and other delights. And they hope that Chase won't unilaterally choose to devalue them, while living with the risk that, unlike their bank accounts, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides no insurance for this valuable currency.   JPMorgan is even working on its own blockchain project, Quorum, which is built on the publicly accessible Ethereum network. Presumably, Mr. Dimon doesn't think Ethereum, whose value is up more than 2,000 percent over the last year, is also a modern version of tulip mania.   In Mr. Dimon's telling, Bitcoin has value only for people who want to bypass the traditional banking system for illicit purposes, including ''murderers and drug dealers,'' or people living in countries with repressive governments like North Korea and Venezuela. He doubts that this is a large market opportunity, though perhaps he may concede that there are inherent difficulties in accurately sizing up markets where participants like to keep a low profile.   Part of the promise of the blockchain, and associated digital currencies, is the absence of a central authority. It's fair to say that the cult of decentralization may have run too far, with some enthusiasts imagining it as a panacea for every business problem. Centralized networks work well for many functions, like trading stocks or managing flight reservations.   But new use cases for digital currencies are just starting to take shape. They are now being used to create value in the way that Silicon Valley has traditionally done so: regulatory arbitrage. Ride-hailing got its start avoiding onerous taxi medallion costs; Airbnb avoided hotel taxes and regulations; and YouTube played fast and loose with copyright rules.   Similarly, some entrepreneurs are using the blockchain as a way to avoid certain regulatory requirements for raising capital. As a rule, Silicon Valley prefers to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.   Companies are also creating tokens to align incentives around decentralized efforts like open source software or distributed storage networks.   Undoubtedly, there will be plenty of hits and misses, as one would expect in the early days of a new technology. And there will be some outright scams as well.   But the toothpaste is now out of the tube, and there is sufficient momentum for legitimate use cases to develop. Presumably, that's why JPMorgan itself is investing resources in developing these technologies and applications.   Economists use the term ''cheap talk'' for words that don't have any payoff. Despite his withering Bitcoin critique, Mr. Dimon also said, ''Don't ask me to short it. It could be at $20,000 before this happens, but it will eventually blow up.''   Mr. Dimon added that he would fire any employee who traded Bitcoin. But he didn't say how he would deal with an employee who publicly identifies a $70 billion fraud -- then doesn't find a way to make a dime out of it.   Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He has direct and indirect interest in shares of JPMorgan Chase, as well as in both digital currencies and platforms that trade in them.     "
New Virtual Currencies Hit Barriers in U.S. and 2 Other Nations,"Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter @nathanielpopper SAN FRANCISCO -- Regulators in the United States, South Korea and Switzerland all took independent steps on Friday to crack down on so-called initial coin offerings, a hot but risky new method of raising money for start-ups.  In the first nine months of the year, various projects raised over $1.5 billion from investors by selling new virtual currencies, according to CB Insights. These new coins are usually modeled on Bitcoin, but are meant to be used only inside the projects they are associated with. One new coin, for example, is intended to be a gambling chip in a still-unfinished casino program.    The market has taken off with investors around the world, but has so far operated with almost no regulatory oversight.   In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission warned in July that some of these offerings were likely to violate securities law, but the agency did not take steps against any specific offenders at the time.   On Friday, the agency found its first target in Maksim Zaslavskiy, the promoter of two coins that were supposed to have been backed by real estate and diamonds.   The agency said on Friday that Mr. Zaslavskiy had told investors that he had a team of lawyers, brokers and accountants working on the project when, in reality, ''none had been hired or even consulted.''   The S.E.C.'s complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, accused Mr. Zaslavskiy of fraud and asked for a freeze on his assets.   Mr. Zaslavskiy, a 38-year-old Brooklyn resident, could not immediately be reached for comment.   In the world of coin offerings, Mr. Zaslavskiy's were small potatoes -- the S.E.C. said REcoin, his real estate coin, had raised only around $300,000. The largest coin offerings have raised over $200 million.   But the charges on Friday suggest that the agency is serious about going after offenders.   South Korea took much stronger steps on Friday, banning coin offerings in the country after a similar move by China a few weeks ago.   Virtual currency trading has taken off in South Korea in recent months, and many entrepreneurs promoting coins have made trips to South Korea seeking investors.   The South Korean Financial Services Commission promised ''stern penalties'' for anyone who issues coins in the country. The authorities have already arrested people who have been involved in virtual currency operations that defrauded investors, the regulators said.   Until recently, Switzerland appeared to be a rare place where regulators were friendly to virtual currency businesses and coin offerings, leading many entrepreneurs to base their operations in the country. On Friday, though, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority announced that it was ''investigating a number of I.C.O. cases to determine whether regulatory provisions have been breached.''   The Swiss agency echoed earlier statements from regulators in the United States, who said that at least some coins being sold should fall under regulations governing securities.   The agency said it would initiate ''enforcement proceedings'' if its current investigations turned up any coin offerings that had violated the rules.   The announcements pushed down the price of most virtual currencies on Friday.   But the scrutiny of the market has not stopped new entrepreneurs from planning their own coin offerings. Just in the next week, over two dozen projects are set to begin raising money, according to Token Data.     "
"Understanding Ethereum, Bitcoin's Virtual Cousin","Bitcoin has many cousins and competitors. None have grown more popular than Ethereum, a global computer network with its own virtual currency, called Ether. What is Ethereum?    Ethereum is a global computing network operating according to rules defined by Ethereum software.   Those rules allow the Ethereum network to be programmed to complete certain types of computing tasks, with every computer on the network completing the task in parallel to ensure it is done correctly. Generally the tasks involve money.    The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has likened it to a global smartphone that can be programmed to operate according to the apps built on top of it. The apps are called Dapps because they are run by a decentralized network of computers.   Mr. Buterin says he chose the name because it refers to ''the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.'' He announced Ethereum in late 2013, but it didn't go into operation until 2015.   Ethereum is not a virtual currency?   The Ethereum network has its own virtual currency, Ether. In the simplest sense, Ether are needed to pay the other computers on the network to complete tasks. It isn't free to use the network.   People have also decided to buy and hold Ether, betting that it will become more valuable as more people want to use the network and need Ether to pay for the network's computing power.   What does Ethereum have to do with Bitcoin?   Mr. Buterin was a Bitcoin aficionado, and he was inspired by its success. But he set out to build something that could do more than Bitcoin: He wanted to build a system that would make it possible to program more complex financial transactions.   The shared records of the Ethereum network -- of every transaction and computation it has ever performed -- are known as a blockchain, just as the shared records of all Bitcoin transactions are known as a blockchain. But Ethereum's blockchain database is totally independent of Bitcoin's blockchain.   Why would you want to use this network?   Let's say two companies want to conduct a complicated financial transaction, like settling a stock option. Neither company trusts the other company to conduct the transaction on its computers. Both companies could hire a third party, like a stock exchange, to conduct the transaction, which is what they generally do today.   But that forces them to trust that third company and to pay that company fees. With Ethereum, they can conduct the transaction on a shared computer that allows them both to check the records, ideally saving on fees.   As this example suggests, Ethereum has proved attractive to financial companies that have to complete lots of complicated financial transactions with competitors they don't trust. Many banks are looking at how Ethereum could be used as a central operating system for various trading markets, replacing today's exchanges and middlemen. JPMorgan Chase has even created its own version of Ethereum, known as Quorum.   Other companies, like Samsung and Toyota, have experimented with Ethereum as a way to keep track of products moving through supply chains that involve many players.   Dozens of large companies around the world came together this year to create the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. The group is working to develop versions of the Ethereum software that are battle tested enough to be used in a corporate setting.   Does that mean the world's biggest companies will corner the market on Ether?   The versions of the Ethereum software that companies are building will most likely be used to set up private networks that would be totally separate from the public Ethereum network and that would not use the Ether currency. Some people, though, are betting that these private networks will eventually be plugged back into the public network.   How do you buy Ether?   Just as with Bitcoin, you can buy Ether from people who already own them on virtual currency exchanges. Most large countries have exchanges where a variety of virtual currencies can be bought with the local currency.   How are Ether created?   Just as with Bitcoin, Ethereum are ''mined,'' or created by computers joined into the Ethereum network. These computers are in a race to complete the transactions and computing work on the network. The faster your computers, the more likely you are to win the race and receive a bundle of new Ether. There is generally a new winner every 15 seconds or so.   It has not yet been decided how many Ether will ultimately be distributed, but the number is likely to be around 100 million. So far, 94 million have been distributed.   As with Bitcoin, Ethereum mining serves a dual process of getting new Ether into the world while providing an incentive for people to join the network and help maintain the Ethereum blockchain.

An Explanation of Initial Coin Offerings,"Initial coin offerings have come out of nowhere in 2017 to become the talk of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Programmers have raised over $3.2 billion this year by selling their own virtual currencies to investors. That is 3,000 percent more than the amount raised using coin offerings in 2016. What is an initial coin offering? Coin offerings are a way for start-ups or online projects to raise money without selling stock or going to venture capitalists -- essentially a new form of crowdfunding.  The programmers raise money by creating and selling their own virtual currency, generally with rules similar to well-known virtual currencies like Bitcoin. The new tokens are usually designed so that they can be used only on a computing service the programmers are building. Filecoin, which raised $257 million in the largest coin offering to date, is being designed to pay for storage on a global cloud storage network that the creators of Filecoin are promising to build. BET, another coin, is being designed to serve as the chips in an online casino its programmers are promising to build. ""Promising to build"" is the operative phrase here, because in almost every case the services that will supposedly make these coins valuable have not yet been finished. What does this have to do with existing virtual currencies? These coins are generally inspired by older virtual currency systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum, with a cap on the number of coins that will exist -- to provide a sense of goldlike scarcity -- and a structure that allows them to operate entirely outside the existing financial and regulatory ecosystem. Investors generally buy the new coins by sending the programmers Bitcoin or Ether (the virtual currency inside the Ethereum network). What's more, many of the coins are stored, moved around and enabled by other Ethereum technology. But the coins sold in coin offerings are meant to exist independent of Bitcoin and Ethereum, with their own free-floating value. (For a more complete explanation of Bitcoin, click here, and for an Ethereum explainer, click here.) Is there a relation to initial public offerings of shares in a company? The name for coin offerings was clearly inspired by the initial public offerings that companies do to sell stock to investors. But unlike stock offerings, coin offerings are generally designed so that investors don't get an ownership stake in the start-ups. If the coin does provide an ownership stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, the companies must comply with all securities law. A few coins have done this, but most have tried to avoid it. Investors can contribute as much or as little money as they want in these offerings, which are generally more like crowdfunding campaigns that new projects do on Kickstarter or Indiegogo. Why would anyone pay for these coins? In principle, people buy these coins because they want to use the services on which the coin will be used. So far, though, almost none of the services have been completed. In the meantime, people are buying coins because they are hoping the value will go up. When the Stratis token was released in July 2016, it was worth seven-tenths of a penny. In the fall of 2017, each of those tokens was trading for around $2.95, a 42,000 percent increase. After the initial coin offering, when the programmers sell their tokens for a set price, coins are traded on third-party exchanges through open-market bidding -- similar to the way stocks are traded and priced after an I.P.O. The programmers who created the coins generally keep a large stash of coins so that they also benefit if the price goes up. The people betting on the price of these tokens are generally betting that the services promised by the programmers will be completed, creating demand for the coins in the future. Why aren't these start-ups raising money through venture capitalists? The most obvious reason to do a coin offering is that you can raise more money than you ever could from venture capitalists. The most valuable virtual-currency company that was funded with venture capital, Coinbase, raised $100 million this year, five years after it was founded. The same day that was announced, Filecoin, which doesn't even have a working product, announced that it had raised over $200 million. Another plus: Start-ups that raise money through coin offerings don't have to give away ownership of their technology to outside investors. Some programmers look to coin offerings because they can raise money for projects that venture capital won't fund. Specifically, coin offerings can provide funding to build open-source projects that in the end no one will own, the way that no one owns Bitcoin or Ethereum. Filecoin's cloud storage network, for instance, would be operated by its users rather than any central company. How do you create your own virtual currency? It is easier than it seems. The software behind Bitcoin and Ethereum is open source, which means that anyone can take the computer code and tweak it to create a virtual currency with slightly different characteristics. There are companies that will do this for you if you are not technologically adept. Convincing people that your new coin will have value is the harder part, and many coins that are released never grow to be worth anything. Some companies have gone the more complicated route of creating their own new software for their coins, with qualities that are very different from Bitcoin and Ethereum. Who can invest in coin offerings? Anyone who has Bitcoin or Ether and is willing to send their money to the creators of a coin offering. Is this illegal? China and South Korea have said it is illegal. In the United States and many other countries, regulators have said some coins should be categorized as securities, like stocks and bonds. If a coin is categorized as a security, it has to follow all relevant securities law, such as registering with the authorities and ensuring that people buying the coins are properly accredited and vetted. Suffice to say, essentially no coin offerings have followed these rules. Many people are waiting for regulators to crack down. Some are expecting that the first targets will be the exchanges where the coins are traded. What happens if the programmers never build what they promise? Investors don't have much recourse. The most likely outcome will be that the investors will lose the money they put into the project, though people may try to sue. What do real investors think of this? A number of prominent Silicon Valley investors have argued that coin offerings could provide a way to build open-source projects that would not have otherwise received support. Some big names think this will lead to a new generation of open-source internet protocols and loosen the control of big companies like Google and Facebook. Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has argued that ""by enabling the development of new open networks, tokens could help reverse the centralization of the internet, thereby keeping it accessible, vibrant and fair, and resulting in greater innovation."" But even sophisticated enthusiasts believe that almost all of the companies currently raising money through coin offerings will fail and lose money for their investors -- and probably should not happen in the first place. ""Right now, with all of the enthusiasm for crypto assets out there, I am very concerned that nobody is being careful about anything,"" Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, wrote on his blog.

Skeptics Can't Cool Blistering Bitcoin Market,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Digital gold. The new tulip mania. A virtual currency. Whatever you want to call it, Bitcoin is on an extraordinary run, with the price of a single Bitcoin crossing $10,000 on some exchanges for the first time on Monday -- less than two months after it crossed $5,000 for the first time.    It is a bull market with few precedents in recent investing history. The Dow Jones industrial average, in its biggest year, 1915, went up 82 percent, or one-tenth as much as Bitcoin has gone up this year. Amazon's red-hot stock is up only one-fifteenth as much as Bitcoin this year.   The price has been pushed up by a flood of new buyers from around the world who think they have spotted a new kind of investment that could ultimately compete with gold as a place to store money outside the control of companies and governments.    These mainstream investors have not just been the libertarian-minded programmers who helped Bitcoin survive its rocky first seven years, after the mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto released it in 2009.   In recent months, trading among ordinary investors has taken off in South Korea and Japan. Seoul now has multiple storefronts where less technically adept people can buy and sell Bitcoin. It was on Korean exchanges where the price of Bitcoin first hit $10,000 on Monday.   On American exchanges, the price was hovering around $9,700 on Monday.   The skyrocketing price has brought forth no shortage of skeptics, from Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, to Warren E. Buffett, who have variously called it a fraud, a bubble and a Ponzi scheme.   The untethered price increase has, to a degree, proved their point, suggesting that this is an investment tied to few real-world fundamentals.   But each time the skeptics have come forward, investors have defied them and bought more Bitcoins at higher prices. On Sunday, more than $5 billion was traded on Bitcoin exchanges, according to the data site Coinmarketcap.com -- a greater volume than what many American stock exchanges see on a normal day.   Believers in the Bitcoin technology, which is backed by a new kind of computer network, have argued that what we are seeing is the formation of a new asset class that could join stocks, bonds and physical commodities in the investment portfolios of ordinary people.   If this is a new digital gold, today's extraordinary prices still leave the total supply of Bitcoins in the world at a value that is only one-sixtieth of all the real gold in the world.   But even aficionados have been dumbstruck by just how quickly the price has gone up in recent months.   ''While there has been a slew of bullish news for Bitcoin of late, the rapidity of the ascent to $10,000 has taken many of us by surprise,'' said Chris Burniske, an investor and a co-author of the book ''Cryptoassets.''   Or as one trending comment on the Reddit social network put it: ''This is officially madness. I am going to prepare myself for a large correction.''   Hedge funds have also been clamoring to get a piece of the action. More than 100 hedge funds invest only in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.   In many places, this trading is happening on exchanges with little regulatory oversight or transparency. This has given rise to fears that a problem at one of the exchanges could trigger a panicked run on Bitcoin, something that is not unlikely given the relative inexperience of many of the new investors.   A steep rise in the price of Bitcoin in late 2013 was punctured when the biggest exchange at the time, Mt. Gox, was discovered not to have the Bitcoins it claimed to have. That led to a three-year lull in the price.   But current investors see that after all the previous popped bubbles -- and there have been several -- the price eventually returned to its old high and then vaulted past it. The price of a Bitcoin is now more than seven times the high it reached in 2013.   What's more, the Bitcoin ecosystem is now more distributed around the world, with less reliance on a single company like Mt. Gox, which collapsed three years ago. While Mt. Gox hosted more than 75 percent of all Bitcoin trading in 2013, the largest exchanges today have only around 10 percent of the business. That should theoretically make the industry less vulnerable to problems at one institution.   Bitcoin has been able to flow around the world and reach investors in countries large and small, because of the singular design that was laid out by its creator.   Bitcoins are stored and traded on a decentralized network of computers that is not under the control of any government or company. That has been attractive to people in countries, like China and Zimbabwe, where the government has a history of seizing bank accounts and assets.   The growing number of people using it in all these countries, often against the wishes of their governments, has also underscored the degree to which the software that manages Bitcoin has remained impervious to hackers and government control for nearly a decade.   The recent price increases, though, have meant that Bitcoin is not living up to its promise as a currency routinely used for small purchases. Few people want to spend their Bitcoins if they believe the price will double in the next month.   Bitcoin has remained popular as a way to pay for illegal drugs online because of the ability to open a Bitcoin wallet without providing any personal information.   But Bitcoin has faced competition on this front from virtual currencies that provide more privacy. And the overall black market trade has diminished this year after the authorities took down some of the largest black market websites in the summer.   This has been welcome news for many Bitcoin backers who want to see it lose its shadowy associations.   Many Bitcoin investors have also come to believe that the Bitcoin network is not particularly well suited to handle lots of little transactions.   These investors frequently argue that what Bitcoin is designed to do well is store money securely and outside the control of any company or government that could seize it, like a more transportable version of gold.   ''The reason people own Bitcoin is because it's a great store of value, possibly the greatest that has ever existed,'' said Jimmy Song, a programmer who works on the Bitcoin software.   The last few years have brought a proliferation of virtual currencies that aim to compete with Bitcoin, sometimes with the goal of handling transactions more cheaply and quickly.   This year, it appeared that the most popular virtual currency network other than Bitcoin, Ethereum, might pass Bitcoin in value. At the time, Bitcoin was hobbled by an internal battle over how to update the software and expand the network.   In October, though, one side gave up the fight, and since then the price of Bitcoin has shot up, sometimes rising more in a week than it rose in its first seven years.   In recent weeks, Bitcoin isn't the only virtual currency that has been moving up. Ether, which lives on the Ethereum network, and Bitcoin Cash, another Bitcoin competitor, have also been rising quickly in value as investors look for anything that might have the same durability and upward mobility as the original.

"Bitcoin Hasn't Replaced Cash, but to Investors It's as Good as Gold","SAN FRANCISCO -- When Bitcoin first entered the public consciousness a few years back, a handful of large companies like Dell and Expedia announced that they would begin accepting the virtual currency. But there weren't many takers. This failure hasn't bothered many of the people buying up Bitcoins in recent months, pushing the price to new highs -- above $13,000 for one Bitcoin on Wednesday.    These investors aren't using their tokens to buy computers or to book trips. Instead, they are hoarding Bitcoins as if it were virtual gold, a new way to store money outside the control of any government or company.   ''I've always been skeptical of directly competing with and replacing existing forms of payment,'' said Steve Lee, a longtime Google employee from San Francisco who is investing in virtual currencies. ''Today what Bitcoin is excellent at, and has mostly solved, is being your own bank.''    The argument about what Bitcoin does well and not so well can seem like a semantic debate for computer nerds, with little relevance to the outside world.   But disagreements within the Bitcoin community are being watched closely by central bankers and financial industry executives. The titans of finance are monitoring Bitcoin's successes and failures as they experiment with its technological concepts, like the ledger for recording virtual currency transactions, known as the blockchain.   Many large institutions have said they hope to integrate blockchain technology into their designs for the world's future financial infrastructure, and those designs are likely to be influenced by what is learned from Bitcoin.   ''People are looking at this in part because they see the beginnings of a new financial system -- a financial system that has a very different structure than the one we have right now,'' said Neha Narula, the director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   Mr. Lee and others hope Bitcoin can be used for payments someday, but he thinks that will most likely come from software that is built on top of Bitcoin, not the Bitcoin network itself.   Not everyone agrees with Mr. Lee's position. Many entrepreneurs and academics think virtual currencies will gain traction only if they are easy and cheap to send around. The disagreement has given rise to a host of Bitcoin competitors -- including a separate virtual currency known as Bitcoin Cash.   But the community that has developed around the original Bitcoin has increasingly been united around a vision that is focused on its goldlike qualities, rather than its ability to compete with PayPal or Western Union.   ''The reason people own Bitcoin is because it's a great store of value, possibly the greatest that has ever existed,'' said Jimmy Song, a developer who has contributed to the Bitcoin software. ''You can send money to Africa in 10 minutes, but that's not the main reason people buy it.''   When Bitcoin was introduced in 2008, the title of the paper written by its creator, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, called the currency an ''electronic cash system.''   The Bitcoin software created a decentralized network of computers that anyone with internet access could join, making it easy to send Bitcoins between addresses. And Bitcoin first gained public notice because of its use as anonymous digital cash on black-market websites like the Silk Road.   But the number of people using Bitcoin to buy things was always small compared with the number of speculators buying it because of its scarcity. This was something the original software behind Bitcoin had also encouraged, by setting a limit of 21 million on the number of Bitcoins that would ever be released.   The increasing value of Bitcoin made it even less attractive as a way to pay for things. Most people don't want to pay now with a dollar that could be worth twice as much next week.   There are also limits on the Bitcoin system's capacity. A rule written into the Bitcoin software had established that the network could process only around five transactions per second -- compared with the 25,000 transactions handled by Visa each second.   This bottleneck led to a fight between people looking to use Bitcoin for different purposes. Many early followers believed the system could expand to handle more transactions without sacrificing its status as a virtual commodity. This camp proposed a change to the Bitcoin rules that would have doubled the capacity of the system in November.   But Mr. Lee and other investors and programmers worried that quickly expanding the Bitcoin network would threaten Bitcoin's independence.   ''To be a global money, you can't have one bank or one country controlling the money, or even a handful of countries or banks,'' Mr. Lee said. ''If decentralization is jeopardized, most things fall apart with Bitcoin.''   Decentralization is a result of Bitcoin's unusual design, which allows users to keep and monitor the records of every single Bitcoin transaction, without any central authority.   If the number of transactions quickly increased, many Bitcoin aficionados believed, only large companies would be able to keep the records. What's more, they believed the design of Bitcoin wasn't well suited to competing with PayPal and Visa, because every transaction has to be recorded on thousands of computers around the world.   ''Anyone who looked at Bitcoin and saw 'cheap payments' likely doesn't have much background in computer science,'' said Ben Davenport, a co-founder of the virtual currency start-up BitGo and an opponent of doubling the network.   This argument prevailed, and in early November the plan to double the network capacity was called off.   Since then, people interested in using virtual currencies to make payments have looked to Bitcoin competitors. Stephen Pair, the chief executive of Bitpay, a start-up that helps companies take virtual currency payments, said his customers were looking to move beyond Bitcoin.   ''If people can't engage in commerce, it's hard to imagine why they'd want to store their money in Bitcoin in the first place,'' Mr. Pair said.   Mr. Pair believes it is irresponsible to suggest that a virtual currency that has been around for less than a decade could pose a credible challenge to gold. The conceit of Bitcoin as a good place to store money, he added, will be less convincing when the price of Bitcoin goes down, as it has in the past.   One alternative is Bitcoin Cash, which was created in August. The price of Bitcoin Cash has risen over 125 percent since the plan to double the capacity of the original Bitcoin was called off.   But there is no shortage of investors who have voted with their pocketbooks for the more cautious approach of the original Bitcoin.   The price of a Bitcoin has jumped 70 percent over the past month, to more than 10 times the price of an ounce of gold.   ''I don't think most people treat Bitcoin as something to buy because it'll get feature X, Y and Z in the future,'' Mr. Song said. ''Mostly, people are investing because they believe it to be a good store of value.''     "
"DealBook Briefing: Bitcoin Surges Past $16,000","Good Thursday. Here's what is happening:  Morgan Stanley has fired Harold Ford Jr. for misconduct.     Bob Iger might stay at Disney a little longer.    Bitcoin Surges Past $16,000   Like what you see? Get the DealBook Briefing in your inbox each morning. Here's the sign-up.   Morgan Stanley has fired Harold Ford Jr. for misconduct.   The Associated Press reports:     Morgan Stanley on Thursday fired former Congressman Harold Ford Jr. following allegations of misconduct.   HuffPost reported Thursday that a woman alleged that Ford forcibly grabbed her one evening in Manhattan, engaging in harassment and intimidation. The incident took place several years ago and there are emails that confirm the interaction, HuffPost reported.   ''He has been terminated for conduct inconsistent with our values and in violation of our policies,'' Morgan Stanley said in a statement.   In a tweet Ford denied the allegations. ''This simply did not happen. I have never forcibly grabbed any woman or man in my life,'' Ford wrote.   Ford joined Morgan Stanley in 2011 as a managing director. He was a Democratic congressman for Tennessee.   If you thought bitcoin had been volatile before...   Take a look at its move over the past 40 hours.   Late Tuesday one bitcoin traded around $11,700. Since then it has surged more that 60 percent, crossed eight millennial markers, and briefly surpassed $19,000.   The cryptocurrency has retreated since crossing $19,000 and was recently trading above $16,500.   Bitcoin was valued at less than $1,000 at the start of the year and has gained more than 15,000 percent so far this year.   Bob Iger might soon have a new reason to stay at Disney.   As Brooks Barnes put it in the NYT, the executive who replaces Mr. Iger as Disney's C.E.O. when his contract is up in 2019 may be Mr. Iger himself.   This time, the reason is that if Disney clinches a deal to buy huge chunks of 21st Century Fox, Mr. Iger would be needed to oversee integration of the operations.   Andrew adds:   I'm hearing that Rupert Murdoch is worried that if Mr. Iger were to leave in 2019, his replacement might not be as invested in the combined company and the various people who would join Disney.   Of course, staying longer also means that Mr. Iger wouldn't be able to run for president, as some expect him to. Cue gossip among media executives about whether this is a power play by Mr. Murdoch ...   All this highlights Disney's succession problem. News reports have said that James Murdoch, Fox's chief executive, who could join Disney, may eventually step up. (That idea isn't among the formal negotiating points between Disney and Fox.)   Don't forget Comcast: The cable giant is still talking with Fox (though Disney is in the lead). Bloomberg says Comcast's real targets are international assets like Fox's stakes in the Star media empire in India and the British broadcaster Sky.   And here's a lighter take on the Disney-Fox talks, courtesy of Paul Pendergass, formerly DealBook's ''Jack Flack'' columnist.   How much would a government shutdown cost...   About $6.5 billion a week, according to a report from S&P Global analysts. That would shave roughly 0.2% off fourth quarter gross domestic product each week the government is closed.   Congress faces a midnight deadline Friday to avert a partial government shutdown.   The House is scheduled to vote Thursday on a bill that would fund the government through Dec. 22. But drama built earlier this week over whether the House would have pass legislation to avert a shutdown as conservative members voiced their oposition.   The latest: House Speaker Paul Ryan suggested to the Associated Press that House Republicans have enough votes even if all Democrats vote against the measure. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, said the group will likely provide the Republican leadership with the needed votes.   What about the debt ceiling? The threat of a shutdown comes as the government runs up against its debt limit. Writes Beth Ann Bovino, S&P Global's chief U.S. economist:   ''The dim shutdown scenario pales in comparison to a debt ceiling impasse. Congress suspended the limit through Dec.8, 2017. However, the debt limit will be reset on Dec. 9, and the Treasury Department will then have to begin taking its usual ''extraordinary measures.'' Unless the debt ceiling is raised, the government will run out of money next spring, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Were this to happen, the seemingly even more implausible scenario of the Treasury being left with insufficient funds to meet it financial obligations would be a catastrophic one, albeit man-made.''   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Congress Wednesday that he will start using the ''extraordinary measures'' at noon on Friday.   UnitedHealth leads more upheaval in health care.   UnitedHealth's $4.9 billion takeover of a physician group from DaVita may not be as big as CVS's deal for Aetna. But it highlights how fast traditional boundaries in health care are dissolving.   UnitedHealth has been disrupting the industry for a long time. It already owns a pharmacy benefit manager and an outpatient services provider. Now the DaVita division will give it a doctor network.   Reed Abelson of the NYT quoted Craig Garthwaite, a health economist at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, on integration:   ''There's no chance that the existing companies, be they hospital or insurers, have the right configuration of assets to be successful'' at turning health care into a business where the parties are able to produce better outcomes at a lower cost, he said.   Critics' corner    Brooke Sutherland and Max Nisen write, ''Steady diversification with small deals is the kind of strategy that can win this race.'' (Gadfly)    Charley Grant writes, ''With cheap credit readily available and UnitedHealth's sparkling long-term returns as an inducement, the recipe for succeeding in health care is pretty clear.'' (Heard on the Street)   Extra credit: Barclays and Goldman Sachs will each lend CVS $20 billion as part of the Aetna takeover, the kind of big deal lending that was traditionally the province of JPMorgan Chase, according to the WSJ.   Is the tax overhaul starting to fray at the seams?   A lot is still being changed. And not everything is going well.   While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is open to keeping more generous state and local tax deductions, a deal with Senator Susan Collins of Maine to help prop up the Affordable Care Act has been all but rejected by House Republicans, potentially jeopardizing her final vote.   Meanwhile, Republicans are looking at cuts to social welfare programs like Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare to help pay for the bill -- unpopular moves that would come ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.   ''Holy crap, what's this?'': That's what Greg Jenner, a former top tax official in George W. Bush's Treasury Department, said of the tax legislation to Politico, describing how the new rules could be gamed.   How the business world is responding   Some analysts increasingly see no reason for investors to put more money into the stock market because of the tax legislation, since companies probably won't spend as much on buybacks as people think.   Meanwhile, Citigroup says that it expects a $20 billion hit to its profits under the proposal, though it still plans to return some $60 billion to investors over the next three years.   But one of the private equity world's biggest moguls is OK with the bill:   The Washington flyaround   · House Republican leaders believe they have the votes to avert a government shutdown. (Politico)   · Behind President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel: frustration from supporters like Sheldon Adelson. (NYT)   · Michael Flynn told a former business associate that economic sanctions would be ''ripped up'' in the Trump administration's first days, according to a whistle-blower. (NYT)   · Senator Elizabeth Warren is in the same camp as Mr. Trump on megadeals, an alliance that puts more pressure on big mergers. (Breakingviews)   Tech's big giants are turning on each other.   Spats like the one between Alphabet and Amazon -- in which YouTube was pulled from Amazon's Fire TV and Echo Show devices, and Amazon then appeared to stop selling Alphabet's Nest devices -- highlight a rise in the stakes as these companies battle for consumers' minds and money.   It's consumers who may lose out, the media analyst Dan Rayburn told the WaPo.   But Shira Ovide of Gadfly thinks that, in at least one case, tech companies should do more backbiting. She's urging Twitter and Snapchat to team up against Facebook:   Snapchat's rocky road in its first nine months as a public company has some echoes to Twitter's rocky road since its initial public offering in 2013. It's scary out there for each company on its own.   Who hacked Uber? A 20-year-old Florida man appears to have led the breach that resulted in the theft of millions of riders' data -- and then have been paid to keep quiet, according to Reuters.   Alexa, run my life: Katherine Bindley of the WSJ tried to see how much of her life she could outsource to Amazon products and services. Among her conclusions: ''No matter how well the Echo Look functions, posing for it every morning is stressful.''   The latest in sexual misconduct news.    Time named ''the silence breakers'' -- women and men who spoke about harassment and assaults they suffered from powerful men -- as its person of the year. (NYT)    Democratic senators including Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have called upon Al Franken to resign. He could announce his plans to step down today. (The Hill)    Six women have filed a class-action lawsuit against the Weinstein brothers and several business associates. (NYT)    The venture capitalist Justin Caldbeck, who has been accused of misconduct, tweeted support for #MeToo. It didn't go over well. (Quartz)   The buyer of that controversial Leonardo painting is revealed.   It wasn't a famous art collector like Steve Cohen who paid $450.3 million at auction last month for ''Salvator Mundi.'' It was a little-known Saudi prince with no history as a major art buyer, Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud.   From David Kirkpatrick of the NYT:   Prince Bader splurged on this controversial and decidedly un-Islamic portrait of Christ at a time when most members of the Saudi elite, including some in the royal family, are cowering under a sweeping crackdown against corruption and self-enrichment.   As it happens, Prince Bader is a friend and associate of the leader of the purge: the country's 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.   Bitcoin: now above $14,000.   And it's still rising. That has Wall Street keeping a close eye on the digital currency and associated technologies like the blockchain.   But Bitcoin is being hoarded like virtual gold, and that has downsides.   Here's what Brian Armstrong of Coinbase told the NYT:   ''It's probably a little bit too focused on the price or people trying to make money,'' Mr. Armstrong said last week. ''The thing I'm passionate about with digital currency is the world having an open financial system.''   Roger Goodell has a new contract. What's next?   The N.F.L. finally agreed to give him a new $200 million deal, though nearly all that money is tied to financial targets. Something of an uneasy peace has descended upon the league's owners: Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys had briefly threatened to sue over the negotiations.   More from Ken Belson of the NYT:   The committee had been working since May on the new contract, which would take effect in March 2019. The owners were eager to finish the deal before talks to renegotiate the league's labor and media deals begin in earnest in the next couple of years.   Caveat: The N.F.L. is far from in the clear. Ratings are still falling, critics are still worried about player safety and some fans are still incensed about player protests.   Revolving Door    Fraser Robinson, the top Uber deal maker who negotiated the company's investment from Saudi Arabia last year, has stepped down.

Bitcoin Futures Set Scene for More Gambling,"Bitcoin action is now available without the Bitcoin. The Chicago Board Options Exchange started offering futures on the cryptocurrency late on Sunday. The new contracts open fresh avenues for trading, but for now they have little utility beyond speculation.  The one-month future surged more than 20 percent from the open to $18,700 before trading below $18,000 Monday morning. With the price of Bitcoin rising two-thirds this month alone, that seems fairly sedate. Volume was roughly $50 million, Breakingviews calculates, less than 0.5 percent of actual Bitcoin trading in the previous 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap.com.    Futures have real-world value, allowing producers or consumers of a commodity to insure themselves against price movements, or helping investors to hedge their positions. In the Bitcoin world, there are so-called miners with investments in processing power and hefty costs like electricity who could use the contracts this way, but that's about it. And with Bitcoin soaring more than 15-fold in 2017 to well over $16,000 early Monday, selling Bitcoin futures short is likely to be prohibitively expensive.   Most market players will be cautious until the contracts settle down. There are, though, other reasons for concern. Bitcoin futures aren't perfect proxies for the real thing, partly because they will be settled in dollars, not the cryptocurrency, which trades at different dollar prices in different places. Chicago Board Options Exchange settlements, for example, will be based on Bitcoin's value on the Gemini Exchange, established by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Facebook fame.   CME Group's Bitcoin futures, starting next weekend, will settle at a reference price drawn from multiple exchanges. One opportunity could be arbitrage, exploiting the pricing discrepancies. But it will take time for any patterns to emerge.   Proponents reckon that the entry of two big, regulated United States exchanges bolsters the legitimacy of Bitcoin. It certainly broadens the universe of possible investors, and it invites the creation of new exchange-traded funds, which need a liquid benchmark to track. That would bring Bitcoin exposure to retail investors.   Yet the Futures Industry Association, which represents clearinghouses and big banks, is apprehensive about the light regulatory scrutiny so far. And making the contracts cash-settled means the exchanges -- and their customers -- can now ride the Bitcoin bandwagon without touching the cryptocurrency at all.

Indexes Keep Pushing Higher as Bitcoin Futures Surge in Market Debut,"Technology companies led stocks modestly higher on Monday, driving the market to another set of milestones. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average finished at new highs. Both market gauges also hit record highs on Friday.    Solid gains by health care companies also helped lift the market, outweighing losses among banks and industrial stocks. Energy shares rose along with the price of crude oil.    Many investors had their eyes on Bitcoin futures, which made their market debut. But traders were mostly looking ahead to the outcome of Wednesday's meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers.   ''The market is kind of in a holding pattern, just sort of waiting for the Fed meeting,'' said Randy Frederick, vice president for trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.   The S.&P. 500 index rose 8.49 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,659.99. The index has risen on a weekly basis for the past three weeks. The Dow gained 56.87 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,386.03. The Nasdaq composite index added 35 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,875.08. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks slipped 1.88 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,519.84.   The Fed is scheduled to issue an interest rate policy update on Wednesday. Economists expect the central bank to lift short-term rates by 0.25 percent. That would be the third interest rate increase by the central bank this year.   While inflation has remained low, the Fed has seen a path to gradually raise rates as the economy and labor market have strengthened.   The Labor Department said on Monday that employers posted slightly fewer job openings in October than in the previous month, but the number of people being hired increased. Last week, another report showed that employers added a net total of 244,000 jobs in October and 228,000 in November. The trend helped keep the unemployment rate at 4.1 percent.   Technology companies accounted for much of the market's gains on Monday.   The software maker Symantec rose $1.24, or 4.4 percent, to $29.22. Apple gained 2 percent after the website Apple Insider said the company was delivering new iPhones to customers at a faster pace. Apple also made news after it agreed to acquire the Shazam music-identification service in a deal worth about $400 million, according to a report by the technology website Recode. Apple stock added $3.30 to $172.67.   Allergan led the gainers in health care. The company climbed $4.96, or 3 percent, to $172.76.   Bitcoin futures rose on their first day of trading on a major United States exchange. Trading on the contract for the virtual currency began on Sunday. The first futures contract closed at $18,545, according to data from Cboe Global Markets, ending its initial day of trading with a 20 percent gain from its opening price.   Oil and gas prices rose, lifting energy stocks. Chesapeake Energy added 15 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $3.83.   Benchmark United States crude gained 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $57.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, added $1.29, or 2 percent, to close at $64.69 a barrel in London.   Gold slipped $1.50 to settle at $1,243.70 an ounce, while silver fell 4 cents to $15.70 an ounce. Copper added 3 cents to $2.99 a pound.   Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent.   The dollar edged up to 113.53 yen, and the euro rose to $1.1786. The British pound climbed to $1.3336.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
Bitcoin Is Still Kicking. Why Was I So Wrong?,"Several years ago, tech enthusiasts in San Francisco began buzzing about a new and mysterious thing called Bitcoin. There were rumors that the virtual money, invented by a pseudonymous math genius named Satoshi Nakamoto, would revolutionize modern finance and render government-backed currency obsolete. Or maybe it was just a passing fad. I wanted to understand the phenomenon for myself. So in 2013, I bought a single Bitcoin, a clunky and labor-intensive process that involved going to a CVS and using MoneyGram to wire the dollar value of a Bitcoin -- which was around $140 at the time -- to a cryptocurrency exchange. I sold my Bitcoin a week later for a small loss, thoroughly unimpressed with the experience and pessimistic about the virtual money's prospects.    ''The Bitcoin dream is all but dead,'' I wrote.    Hoo boy, did I blow it. Today, the Bitcoin I sold for about $140 would be worth more than $15,000, and cryptomania has seized the entire world. As of this week, Bitcoin futures are trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and Coinbase, the largest consumer trading platform for Bitcoin, briefly crashed last week because of a huge influx of traffic. And while experts are warning that the exuberance around Bitcoin is a classic sign of a bubble, few think it will disappear altogether even in the event of a crash.   [ALSO READ: What is Bitcoin and How Does it Work?]   What happened? Why did so many people -- myself included -- get Bitcoin so spectacularly wrong? After a couple of weeks of thinking about it, I can point to at least five bad assumptions I made.   I assumed that Bitcoin's future depended on its everyday use.   In the early days of Bitcoin, its proponents envisioned people using cryptocurrencies to buy food, pay their rent and make other day-to-day purchases. Eager to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream, they set up Bitcoin ATMs to facilitate easy transfers and encouraged their local restaurants and bars to start accepting Bitcoin payments.   Today, though, hardly anyone is spending Bitcoin on actual goods and services. (Why would you, if the value could jump 40 percent in two days, as it did last week?) And few merchants have gone through the hassle of updating their systems to accept cryptocurrency.   ''The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and Bitcoin's rapid appreciation is striking,'' a team of Morgan Stanley economists wrote earlier this year.   As it turns out, while few people want to use Bitcoin as a currency, plenty want to treat it as an investable security, similar to gold or silver, especially while the price keeps rising.   I assumed that the blockchain would eclipse Bitcoin itself.   One of the earliest predictions among Bitcoin skeptics and boosters alike was that Bitcoin itself would be just a predecessor technology to the real, lasting innovation: the blockchain -- the peer-to-peer ledger system that records cryptocurrency transactions and allows them to operate without a central authority. I agreed, thinking that the blockchain had real promise, but that Bitcoin would ultimately fade away.   Four years later, there has, in fact, been enormous hype around blockchain projects. (One British company added the word ''blockchain'' to its name and saw its shares immediately jump nearly 400 percent.) But that frenzy hasn't detracted from investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin itself -- in fact, it has amplified it. And the potential applicability of blockchain technology to all kinds of different industries, from auto manufacturing to insurance to groceries, has inspired lots of non-techies to learn about cryptocurrencies, and served as an intellectual on-ramp for new Bitcoin investors.   I assumed that regulators would crack down faster.   In the frontier days of cryptocurrency, it seemed that every other story was about how criminals and tax-evaders were using Bitcoin to buy and sell illegal goods and services. A huge dark-net narcotics market, Silk Road, was broken up, and its owner was sentenced to life in prison. Several large cryptocurrency sites suffered hacks and thefts. It was easy to think that these problems would lead regulators to take swift action against Bitcoin.   But regulators have been late to the game. The I.R.S. didn't issue official guidance on the tax treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies until 2014, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has just recently started to look at whether initial coin offerings, a kind of public auction of new cryptocurrencies, should be more closely regulated.   [ALSO READ: Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy]   Partly, this is because some Trump-era regulators seem more interested in rolling back existing rules than making new ones. But it's also a reflection of the way regulators tend to operate -- many are reactive, and Bitcoin is still a relatively esoteric product that hasn't claimed many real-world victims yet. There might well be a regulatory reckoning as Bitcoin moves closer to the mainstream, but for now, it's still the Wild West.   I assumed that Wall Street would stay away.   Back in 2013, when I began asking Wall Street bankers about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, their reactions ranged from polite dismissal to outright mockery. Few thought digital currency had any chance of succeeding, and many shared the view of Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who has called Bitcoin a ''fraud'' that would only appeal to murderers and drug dealers.   But banks are ultimately service businesses, and I underestimated Wall Street's philosophical flexibility when confronted with a new product that its clients really wanted to trade. Now, in the same way that the rise of junk bonds created an entirely new lucrative finance niche in the 1980s, Bitcoin's rapid ascent has pulled even the most traditional financial institutions into the fray. There are now dozens of cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds, and even Goldman Sachs is clearing Bitcoin futures transactions for some clients. The arrival of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency market has begun to make Bitcoin look less like a fringe technology project, and more like any other securities market.   I assumed that Bitcoin's extreme volatility would be a turnoff.   When Bitcoin's price was swinging wildly between $100 and $200, sometimes within a few days, I thought to myself, ''Who would sign up for such a roller-coaster ride?'' I naïvely thought that what people liked about money was its stability, and knowing that $100 today would still be worth $100 tomorrow.   But you know what's more popular than stable monetary instruments? Casinos! People love to gamble, and the spectacular rise of Bitcoin -- especially in the age of social media, which tends to hasten trends and encourage bandwagon behavior -- has encouraged a set of thrill-seeking speculators to bet big on the currency, hoping to make a quick buck and get out before a crash.   This behavioral dynamic should have been clear to me earlier. In a low-interest-rate environment, when many of the fastest-growing companies are privately held and wages aren't keeping pace with inflation, there aren't many investments that can produce outsize returns for the average person. Many Bitcoin buyers aren't bothered that their $100 could become $200 overnight, or crash to $10 -- in fact, that's part of the appeal.   Real Bitcoin enthusiasts, of course, will say that I'm still missing the point, and that today's trading mania is just a prelude to an even bigger, more transformational era of cryptocurrency. And while I still have my doubts, I can't credibly predict that they're wrong. After all, look what happened the first time.     "
Going Where Few Dare: Initial Coin Offerings,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Indiegogo helped take crowdfunding mainstream. Now the company is hoping it can do the same for initial coin offerings, the popular but unregulated practice of selling custom virtual currencies to raise money for software projects. Indiegogo started a new service on Tuesday to vet coin offerings, also known as I.C.O.s, and then help sell them to small and large investors.    The first project to use the service, a start-up known as the Fan-Controlled Football League, will begin raising $5 million on Indiegogo this week. The start-up aims to use the money to create a league of football teams that will be guided by people who buy the league's coins (a crazy-sounding idea that has already been tested).    ''We want to bring a brand of trust to the entire industry, which we think will bring I.C.O.s to the mainstream,'' said Slava Rubin, one of the founders of Indiegogo.   Smaller crowdfunding platforms like Republic and AngelList have started their own efforts to legitimize coin offerings. But until now, established companies essentially avoided coin offerings because of the numerous legal risks and uncertainties. It was, however, becoming increasingly hard for Indiegogo to ignore the market.   Programmers, entrepreneurs and scammers have raised over $3.5 billion through coin offerings this year, according to Coindesk, after rising out of almost nowhere. That is more than the best-known company in crowdfunding, Kickstarter, has helped companies raise in its entire eight-year history.   Initial coin offerings have been so hot -- and some say so unhinged -- that some companies have found success with them even after failed crowdfunding campaigns. An online art gallery known as Maecenas, which failed to raise 400,000 pounds (currently about $533,000) through crowdfunding this year, raised $15 million a few months later through an I.C.O., the Financial Times has reported.   Established companies have been left out of the I.C.O. craze, in large part because of the legal uncertainty.   The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, has said several times -- most recently on Monday -- that many coins should be categorized as securities and be registered with the authorities, which almost no projects have done. The agency has recently cracked down on a number of projects that aren't legally compliant.   Indiegogo will help coin offerings follow the law by registering them as securities in most cases. This approach puts many restrictions on investors and on projects.   Small investors will be allowed to invest about $10,000 in most projects, and companies will be able to raise no more than $1 million from these investors, because of restrictions put in place by the 2012 JOBS Act. That is a tiny amount compared with the tens of millions of dollars that many coin offerings have raised this year.   Projects going through Indiegogo will be able to raise more money from sophisticated investors. But these investors will also face limitations, such as lockup periods, before they begin selling their tokens to others.   These restrictions could make the new service unattractive. Most coin offerings have been able to garner unlimited amounts of money from any investor; the biggest have raised over $200 million. And at least so far, regulators have cracked down on few of them.   Several law firms have already been working on creating legally compliant methods of initial coin offerings. Indiegogo is working with one of those firms, Cooley.   Sohrob Farudi, the chief executive of the Fan-Controlled Football League, said he was willing to accept the restrictions involved in working with Indiegogo to stay on the right side of the law.   ''We want to be sure that nobody on our side is going to jail and that when we bring this product to market that it will be done the right way,'' Mr. Farudi said.   His group previously raised $63,000 in an Indiegogo campaign to create a minor-league football team guided by fans. Now it is hoping to create a full league with the same principles.   The league will begin this week with what is known as a token presale. Early next year, it expects to do a full initial coin offering, and will likely look to raise around $30 million, Mr. Farudi said. At that point, the people who invested in the presale will receive coins, also referred to as tokens, at a discounted rate.   When the league opens next summer, people who hold the tokens will be able to vote on everything, from what color the jerseys should be to what plays the coaches should call during a game, with votes taken in real time.   The tokens will initially be stored and recorded on the ledger, or blockchain, associated with the Ethereum virtual currency network, though recent congestion on the Ethereum system has the league looking at other blockchain alternatives for the long term.   Mr. Farudi said having the tokens on a virtual currency blockchain would allow every vote to be recorded for all the participants to see.   ''The voting mechanism has to be transparent,'' he said. ''The blockchain is the best example we could find for how to implement that.''   When the league does its I.C.O., Indiegogo plans to categorize it as a so-called utility token, rather than a security, because its main purpose will be to allow for voting on league decisions. Utility tokens come with fewer restrictions than securities.   Mr. Rubin of Indiegogo said most companies doing coin offerings would probably have to register as securities. For now, he thinks that coin offerings won't make sense for most companies, given the additional complications.   In the long run, though, he has joined the chorus of believers who think that all investments are likely to be done on some sort of blockchain because of the way it allows decisions and changes of ownership to be recorded transparently.   ''Over time, I don't think it's going to be a discussion -- I think all of it will be on a blockchain infrastructure,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''The New York Stock Exchange, or the Nasdaq, 20 years from now will be on blockchain. That's what we're talking about.''   Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.     "
What Is Bitcoin Really Worth? Don't Even Ask,"Robert J. Shiller, Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale, is an adviser to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, part of the CME Group. These are his views, not those of the exchange. Dabbling in Bitcoin lies somewhere between gambling and investing. After all, true investing requires a rational appraisal of an asset's value and that is simply not possible at present with Bitcoin. Real understanding of the economic issues underlying the cryptocurrency is almost nonexistent.    It is not just that very few people really comprehend the technology behind Bitcoin. It is that no one can attach objective probabilities to the various possible outcomes of the current Bitcoin enthusiasm.    How can we even start estimating the fundamental value of Bitcoin, with its astonishing market value of more than $275 billion? Any attempt will soon sound silly.   Let's try for just a moment. It is possible to imagine a future in which Bitcoin eventually replaces some fraction of money as we know it today. Suppose that happens soon. Note that one measure of the United States money supply, M1, is today worth more than $3.6 trillion.   But don't get too excited.   Will Bitcoin really replace a large fraction of conventional money? There are reasons to be skeptical. Bitcoin is vastly more volatile than conventional money and relatively few people trust it as a store of value. Even if that hurdle is crossed, how much cryptocurrency will people need?   Putting it in economic terms, will the demand for Bitcoin have the same velocity as the demand for money? Will there be the same number of hoarders? And what about all the other cryptocurrencies that exist today, and those that will arise in the future? Bitcoin might well be replaced by something different and better, and end up being worth nothing at all.   I won't go further down this road. Many people are making analogous attempts to put a fundamental value on Bitcoin -- but such efforts will be intrinsically and absurdly inaccurate. The results of a serious attempt to assess the value of Bitcoin can only be ambiguous.   Ambiguity in economics is an important and developing subject.   Many academic economists still embrace the efficient markets theory: the belief that markets generally respond accurately to genuine new information about fundamentals, and react only to such information. But Bitcoin is an example of ambiguity, and the efficient market theory does not capture what is going on in the market for this cryptocurrency. There has not been enough genuine new information coming in day after day to rationally justify Bitcoin's huge price swings. Something else is afoot.   One narrative that seeks to explain the price increases this year is that they have something to do with the difficulty of betting against -- making short sales of -- Bitcoin. Absent the opportunity to engage in short sales, ''smart money'' can only watch from the sidelines while prices soar. Or so the efficient market theory claims.   But pessimistic investors hoping to profit from a Bitcoin price fall actually have had the opportunity to make negative investments for a while. Bitcoin exchanges such as Bitfinex allow shorting of Bitcoins, and it is possible to short Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded notes on online brokerages like the Bitcoin Investment Trust, GBTC. Both of these options suffer from lack of liquidity and of trust in these new institutions; GBTC has not tracked Bitcoin prices accurately, for example. Still, if enough people had managed to take a short position, that might have helped to limit the increases in Bitcoin prices that we have seen.   It is possible that the Bitcoin market will change in a meaningful way now, given the decision of Cboe, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, to start a Bitcoin futures market on Dec. 10 and of the CME Group to do so on Dec. 18. The academic literature tells us that volatility of an underlying asset often falls after the establishment of new futures markets for it. But the ability to short an asset more easily won't necessarily overcome the power of investor excitement.   In 1936, John Maynard Keynes suggested why. He played down the role of quantitative analysis and probability estimates in human thinking of the assessment of ambiguous future events. People in such situations are vulnerable to a play of emotions and at times a ''spontaneous urge to action'' that he called ''animal spirits.'' He argued that much of what happens in financial markets has to do with people learning, from price movements, about each other's animal spirits.   I believe that Mr. Keynes was correct about animal spirits in general and how they affect markets like the one for Bitcoin. George Akerlof and I expanded on his perspective in our 2009 book Animal Spirits, which argued that the driving force behind human enterprise cannot be reduced to the rational optimization emphasized by traditional economics. Darwinian evolution produced a human species whose behavior sometimes seems to be emotionally driven.   Neuroscientists, psychologists and economists are leading us toward new models of human decision-making. They may help to explain phenomena like the Bitcoin price rise.   Scott Huettel, a Duke neurologist, and other researchers showed in 2006, for example, that when making decisions involving ambiguity, people do not use the parts of the brain required for calculations of probabilities and expected values. And the economists Anat Bracha of the Boston Federal Reserve and Donald Brown of Yale have provided an alternative to conventional economic theory of human behavior under uncertainty. They define a different kind of rationality -- one based on Mr. Keynes' views, not on calculations of utility -- in ambiguous situations.   Furthermore, a paper by neuroscientists including Benjamin Lu that was presented at the Society for Neuroeconomics annual convention in Toronto in October, showed that psychologically stressful experiences can result in changes in neurological processes when ambiguous situations arise.   In short, the Bitcoin market is a marvelous case study in ambiguity and animal spirits. It is providing invaluable information about how millions of human brains process stimuli coming, in this case, from public acceptance, imagination, and innovation surrounding cryptocurrencies.   This is fascinating from a psychological and neurological perspective. But it isn't grounded in solid economics. No wonder the Bitcoin market has been so chaotic.     "
In Code We Trust,"Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of ''The Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads'' and a contributing opinion writer. You don't need brilliant financial analysis skills to notice that Bitcoin is in a bubble. It has grown in value from about 39 cents to over $18,000 in just eight years and recently attracted broad media attention by doubling in just a few days. The conventional wisdom had been that illegal and illicit transactions -- buying drugs or transferring money out of Argentina -- accounted for much of Bitcoin's value. Today the mainstream view sees mere greed and speculation. Yet as Bitcoin continues to grow, there's reason to think something deeper and more important is going on. Bitcoin's rise may reflect, for better or worse, a monumental transfer of social trust: away from human institutions backed by government and to systems reliant on well-tested computer code. It is a trend that transcends finance: In our fear of human error, we are putting an increasingly deep faith in technology.     Bitcoin may be in a bubble, but not all bubbles are created equal. Some are shimmering nothings, reflecting little more than an underlying pyramid scheme. But others are like ocean swells that could become enormous waves. Consider the tech stocks of the late 1990s -- a bubble, to be sure, but in retrospect, was Amazon really overvalued?   What gives the Bitcoin bubble significance is that, like '90s tech, it is part of something much larger than itself. More and more we are losing faith in humans and depending instead on machines. The transformation is more obvious outside of finance. We trust in computers to fly airplanes, help surgeons cut into our bodies and simplify daily tasks, like finding our way home. In this respect, finance is actually behind: Where we no longer feel we can trust people, we let computer code take over.   Bitcoin is part of this trend. It was, after all, a carnival of human errors and misfeasance that inspired the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, namely, the financial crisis. Banks backed by economically powerful nations had been the symbol of financial trustworthiness, the gold standard in the post-gold era. But they revealed themselves as reckless, drunk on other people's money, holding extraordinarily complex assets premised on a web of promises that were often mutually incompatible. To a computer programmer, the financial system still looks a lot like untested code with weak debugging that puts way too much faith in the idea that humans will behave properly. As with any bad software, it can be expected to crash when conditions change.   We might add that major governments -- the issuers of currency, the guarantors of banks and enforcers of contracts -- do not always inspire confidence. Governments can be been tempted to print money recklessly or seize wealth brazenly from their citizens -- Venezuelan hyperinflation and Indian demonetization are recent examples. But even the most trusted governments can be dubious. Europe, riddled by internal struggles among states, is still in shock about the planned departure of Britain from the European Union. China is a secretive authoritarian state that can lash out against its citizens and rivals when it feels insecure. The United States, perhaps the main guarantor of world solvency, is some $20 trillion in debt, constantly on the verge of default and headed by a serial bankruptee who prizes unpredictability. It is little wonder that the world's citizens might be looking for alternatives.   Bitcoin's fans don't entirely distrust human institutions. It is rather that they'd prefer not to need to trust humans to keep their promises, when we know that we humans are deeply fallible. That might seem cynical, but perhaps it is appropriately humble. As Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym for the person or persons who invented Bitcoin, puts it, ''the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work.''   This all helps explain the popularity of Bitcoin as an asset independent of government, mainstream banks and their various shenanigans. But still, is it really worth anything at all? It is based on a ''blockchain,'' a technology that creates a decentralized public ledger and rigorously tracks transfers. It is maintained by its users, and no government can mint more coins. Bitcoin isn't backed by any sovereign, and unlike a stock or a bond, it gives you a claim to nothing other than Bitcoin itself. Yet that illusory quality is true of most forms of money, a shared hallucination that we tolerate as long as it works. If enough others value something, that can be enough to make it serve as a store of value. Sure, Bitcoin will crash again, but over its lifetime, it has already withstood multiple crashes, runs and splits. It actually feels tested.   This isn't to idealize Bitcoin. Despite its virtual nature, it is still a human institution, facing its own misdeeds and governance problems. Odds are that Bitcoin may never function well as a general medium of exchange (something you can buy things with) because of its wild fluctuations, but might work fine as a store of value that you can sell. It may, like Netscape circa 1995, be portending changes to come. But Bitcoin has captured something. As much as we may love other humans, it is now in code we trust.

The Winklevoss Twins' Path to Bitcoin Fortune: DealBook Briefing,"Good Tuesday morning. Here's what we're watching:  The Winklevoss Twins' unorthodox path to fame and Bitcoin fortune     There is a paucity of women in corporate America's c-suites.    Not every analyst is in love with Apple's stock price.    A four-year-old Bitcoin investment fund has posted a 25,004 percent lifetime return.    Apollo's low-priced deal to buy Qdoba.   Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up.    The Winklevoss Twins' unorthodox path to fame and Bitcoin fortune   Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss made a risky bet five years ago: They took $65-million settlement with Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and loaded up on Bitcoin.   That wager has paid off. Their Bitcoin stockpile was worth around $1.3 billion on Tuesday. The question now is whether their bitcoin fortune will prove fleeting.   The New York Times's Nathaniel Popper takes a closer look at the twin's big bet on virtual currencies.    They took their settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg in Facebook shares. The value of their stake grew to $300 million when Facebook went public in 2012.    They began buying Bitcoin in late 2012 when the price of an individual coin was below $10.    At a time when other Bitcoin millionaires are cashing out and buying Lamborghinis, professional hockey teams or even low-risk bond funds, the Winklevoss twins said they had no intention to diversify and have sold almost none of their original holdings.    They have collected an additional $350 million or so of other virtual currencies, most of it in the Bitcoin alternative called Ethereum.    The brothers are also majority owners of the virtual currency exchange they founded, Gemini, which likely takes their joint holdings to a value well over $2 billion, or enough to make them each of them billionaires.   There is a paucity of women in corporate America's c-suites.   And that's getting worse. Women hold only 23 percent of senior executive posts with a title that includes the word chief, down from 24 percent in 2016, according to an analysis by Korn Ferry of the top 1,000 American companies by revenue.   Here is Breakingviews's take:   A detailed breakdown presents an even bleaker picture. Women make up just 6 percent of the blue-chip group's chief executive officers, and 11 percent of its chief financial officers. Parity comes, perhaps predictably, in that most social of C-level jobs, chief human resource officers, where females hold 55 percent of positions.   The overall decline is even more glaring in the wake of the #metoo movement afflicting media, technology, entertainment and political circles. More women in the higher echelons of the corporate ranks could help change a culture that turns a blind eye to, if not condones, bad behavior.   The financial industry might be a test case. The sector outranked all others in the analysis with nearly 30 percent of C-suite jobs held by women. That's a better track record than more female-friendly industries like retail and consumer at 24 percent, yet even in finance women are largely kept out of the most senior roles. Only 5 percent of the industry's CEOs and 8 percent of its CFOs are female, among the lowest levels in the survey.    Apple just got a rare downgrade.   What catalyst will propel Apple's market value above $1 trillion? The Republican tax cuts? The iPhone X? Growth in Apple's services business?   While that question has been a favorite question of market watchers for years, it has become more relevant recently as Apple's market capitalization has crossed the $900 billion mark.   But Nomura Instinet's Jeffrey Kvaal on Tuesday threw some cold water on those bets. In a report, the analyst lowered his rating on Apple's stock to neutral. Mr. Kvaal wrote:   ''We argue that the stock's gains for the iPhone X supercycle are in the late innings. We believe unit growth, if not quite [Average Selling Price] growth, is well anticipated by consensus and a historically full multiple.''   Apple's stock has gained 55 percent this year and is up nearly 10 percent since it unveiled the iPhone X.   Bloomberg notes that downgrades of Apple's stock don't happen too often.   ''Before today, two cuts to neutral or the equivalent in June were the last ones, according to data collected by Bloomberg. One of those firms has since upgraded the shares. Analysts are still overwhelmingly positive on the stock, which has been the largest contributor to the S&P 500 Index's gains this year, with 36 firms rating it a buy, eight advising hold and 0 sell recommendations.''   -- Stephen Grocer   Germany has opened a new front in Europe's fight with Silicon Valley.   Germany's Federal Cartel Office published preliminary findings from a 20-month investigation that Facebook abused its dominant position as a social network in Germany to collect user data from third parties. The Wall Street Journal reports:   ''While Tuesday's findings won't lead to fines, they pave the way for Germany to order changes in the way Facebook does business when it issues a final decision as early as summer 2018. If upheld in European Union court, this new line of attack could eventually expand the boundaries of competition law across the bloc to encompass questions of online privacy.   ''Germany's case turns privacy into a competition issue by arguing that Facebook is the only major social network in Germany, with more than 90% market share, leaving users no choice but to accept its take-it-or-leave-it terms of service--which include consent for the collection of third-party data.''   The investigation is the most recent example of European authorities going after big American tech companies. Here are a few:    The European Union fined Google a record $2.7 billion for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals.    The European Union ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple.    The European Union ordered Luxembourg to collect around $293 million in unpaid taxes from Amazon.    The European Union fined Facebook nearly $130 million for providing misleading information about its acquisition of WhatsApp.    The French government filed a complaint with the Paris Commerce Court against Amazon for abusing its dominant position with some suppliers.   So far European regulators have been more aggressive than the counterparts in the United States. But the increasing size and power of these tech giants are raising concerns. Facebook, Google, and Twitter have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers this year over the manipulation of social media during the 2016 election by Russian operatives.   At a hearing on Russia's involvement in the election this fall, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California told the executives of the three companies: ''You have to be the ones to do something about this. Or we will.''   As Heard on the Street's Dan Gallagher wrote:   ''Such words, coming from tech's senior hometown senator, shouldn't be taken lightly, and Facebook may have the most to lose. The world's largest social network offers a tempting target for those seeking to spread malicious content, yet Facebook's financial performance still depends on maintaining the trust of its users.''   The Bitcoin investor that blew away other hedge funds.   Over the past five years, an index that tracks hedge fund performance has risen 27.83 percent. Over the past four years, the Pantera Bitcoin Fund exceeded that by nearly 1,000 times.   The Pantera fund told investors on Tuesday that its lifetime return has been 25,004 percent -- mostly by buying early into Bitcoin. (That number is bigger now, since the return was calculated last week, when the digital currency reached $15,500.) Not every investor in the fund enjoyed this eye-popping result, but Pantera's compound annual return has been about 250 percent.   More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:   But Dan Morehead, who founded the Pantera fund after an earlier career at Goldman Sachs, said that it was not an easy decision to create a Bitcoin-focused hedge fund in 2013, when Bitcoin was primarily known as a currency for online drug markets.   ''The first hard part was actually deciding to launch a crypto currency fund when everyone else thought that was crazy,'' he said on Monday.   The digital currency flyaround    Investors are falling over themselves to buy into the initial coin offering of Block.one, a software start-up that isn't going to make much software and whose tokens, it says, have ''no purpose.'' (WSJ)    Investors pushed up shares of LongFin, a financial technology company, by 1,000 percent after it announced plans to buy a specialist in blockchain, the transaction ledger tech that underpins digital currencies. (FT)    The analyst Frederick Cannon of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods says that Bitcoin's blockbuster rise is hurting its chances of becoming a viable currency. (WSJ)   Apollo gets a discount in its Qdoba deal.   The investment giant is buying the Mexican restaurant chain from Jack in the Box for $305 million in cash. As of its 2017 fiscal year, its total sales were more than $820 million.   What Apollo is getting: The country's second-biggest Mexican restaurant chain, which operates and franchises more than 700 restaurants.   Why Jack in the Box is selling: The deal is ''consistent with the company's desire to transition to a less capital-intensive business model.'' Read another way, that says, ''We don't want to own and operate so many restaurants.'' Roughly 53 percent of Qdoba's restaurants are company-owned-and-operated, compared to just 12 percent of Jack in the Box restaurants.   The advisers   For Apollo: Deutsche Bank, PJ Solomon, Morgan Lewis & Bockius and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison   For Jack in the Box and Qdoba: Morgan Stanley, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher   -- Michael J. de la Merced   Could a deal for BlackBerry finally be in the cards?   Deep in the WSJ's story on the company's new hope -- its QNX software that could be used to power self-driving cars -- is a nugget of potential deal news: two big investors could back a sale of the company.   More from David George-Cosh and Jacque McNish of the WSJ:   If the stock continues to rise, BlackBerry's two biggest shareholders, Pasadena, Calif.-based Primecap Management Corp. and Toronto-based Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., could support a potential sale, which would allow them to recoup an investment that has long performed poorly, people familiar with the matter said. The two shareholders collectively own about one-quarter of the company's shares.   The publication adds that in the past, Samsung and Oracle had come knocking, interested in BlackBerry's patents. But the company's C.E.O., John Chen has rejected them, with the blessing of big shareholders.   The context: BlackBerry had hired JPMorgan Chase and RBC Capital Markets in 2012 to weigh a potential sale of the company. In 2013, co-founder Mike Lazaridis reached out to private equity firms about helping him take the company private. And yet in 2017, BlackBerry is still a publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of 7.6 billion Canadian dollars, or $5.9 billion.   American shares in BlackBerry were up less than 1 percent in early-morning trading today, at $11.02.   -- Michael J. de la Merced   The G.O.P. tax plan hurts the rich -- just not the very rich.   Get ready to pull out your very tiny violin. But the distinction is there.   From Andrew's latest DealBook column:   In the world of public company chief executives -- many based in states like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and California, where a big chunk of the largest companies in the country reside -- several told me they expected their federal taxes to increase substantially because, unlike some of their wealthy peers in other industries, they cannot turn themselves into pass-through companies or other tax-dodging entities.   And as one self-professed supporter of President Trump in Massachusetts tweeted, ''I didn't vote for this. I want low taxes for all -- not ZERO for more folks. Where's my dollar?''   How big companies will be affected   Tech companies like Microsoft that stash huge amounts of foreign profits offshore are set to take a hit from the overhaul, which would impose a 10.5 percent tax on overseas earnings, according to the WSJ.   That could induce some to return to the United States, which, as the WSJ points out, could reduce the country's trade deficit.   Meanwhile, five financial giants including Citigroup, Bank of America and A.I.G. could collectively take a $50 billion hit, according to the FT.   More in taxes    The Republican Senators Susan Collins and Mike Lee said that they would support the tax proposal, further ensuring its passage in a vote scheduled for today. (The Hill)    Bob Corker said that he faced a ''tough decision'' in deciding to support the tax overhaul after initially opposing it -- and he denied pushing for a last-minute change that would benefit him personally. (NYT)   The Washington flyaround    Mr. Trump outlined a national security strategy that called Russia and China competitors to American dominance. But he ignored investigations into Russian interference in last year's presidential election and may not meaningfully change the American trade deficit with China. (NYT, Bloomberg)    The tax bill's repeal of the individual insurance mandate could lead to higher insurance premiums, though other potential effects have yet to be determined. (NYT)    Matthew Petersen, who was nominated by the White House for a federal judgeship but drew scorn when he couldn't answer basic legal questions, has withdrawn his candidacy. (NYT)   Who could replace John Skipper at ESPN?   Mr. Skipper, who stepped down yesterday as president of the sports powerhouse, citing a ''substance addiction,'' was once one of The Walt Disney Company's most important moneymakers. For now, Disney has appointed George Bodenheimer, a former ESPN president, as acting chairman for 90 days.   More on potential permanent replacements from Lucas Shaw and Eben Novy-Williams of Bloomberg:   Programming boss Connor Schell and distribution chief Justin Connolly are likely internal candidates, as is acting Chairman George Bodenheimer, said the person, who asked not to be identified because process is only just starting. An outside candidate is also possible, the person said.   The context   Mr. Skipper assumed control of the sports network when it was one of the most formidable media properties on the planet, able to command high carriage fees from pay-television providers given its popularity. But as cable TV providers lose customers to streaming services, ESPN has shed subscribers and resorted to layoffs.    The deal angle   Mr. Skipper is stepping down days after Disney announced a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox. Among the assets that would be included in the transaction are Fox's 22 regional sports networks, which could be combined with ESPN to shore up Disney's sports holdings.   Whoever takes over ESPN will also oversee the introduction of one of Disney's big initiatives: a new sports-focused streaming service, ESPN Plus.   Extra credit: Sports Illustrated spoke with several ESPN employees who said they were shocked. ''He just signed a new contract,'' one said. ''He just gave us this rah-rah speech at the mandatory meeting. No one knows what to think.''   Selling the Panthers could earn billions for Jerry Richardson.   Pro sports teams are going for big numbers these days, and the Carolina Panthers -- who almost won the Super Bowl last year -- are assuredly going to earn Mr. Richardson a windfall, even as he faces numerous accusations of improperly touching and harassing women and using a racial slur.   Forbes estimates that the team could be worth $2.3 billion.   What works in the Panthers' favor, according to Ken Belson of the NYT:   The Panthers play in a far larger, more vibrant region than the Bills, the most recent N.F.L. team to be sold. And the Panthers also have a more favorable stadium lease.   Remembering why the team is selling   From Juliet Macur's latest Sports of the Times column in the NYT:   Jerry Richardson, the owner of an N.F.L. team, is crashing and burning amid sexual harassment allegations, including claims that he belittled women for years in various humiliating ways. But you know what? He has found an escape that looks more like a gentle ride under a golden parachute.   In other misconduct news: Microsoft said that it would eliminate forced arbitration agreements with employees who make sexual harassment claims, one of the most prominent companies to do so, according to the NYT.   The food industry is still spending billions for marginally healthier products.   Exhibit A: Campbell agreed to buy Snyder's-Lance, the maker of Kettle Chips and Pop Secret, for roughly $4.8 billion in cash.   Exhibit B: Hershey agreed to buy Amplify Snack Brands, the maker of Skinny Pop popcorn, for about $902 million (or $1.6 billion including debt).   Both Campbell and Hershey are trying to diversify from their core food products, soup and chocolate. Both have had stagnant sales in recent years. The advantage of pursuing Snyder's-Lance and Amplify is that they focus on somewhat more healthful snacks, a category that has risen in popularity.   Critics corner    Lauren Silva Laughlin writes of the Snyder's-Lance deal, ''Big family shareholders are an obstacle to any outside investor trying to derail the deal, which is a pity because Campbell is on course to destroy shareholder value.'' (Breakingviews)    Tara Lachapelle writes, ''Here come those desperate-looking food deals we told you about.'' (Gadfly)   Things are looking up for Twitter.   Shares in the social networking company jumped 11 percent yesterday, in one of their biggest one-day leaps in the past year.   Possible reasons    JPMorgan Chase's Doug Anmuth upgraded the stock's price target to $27 from $20 and called the company one of the ''top small and mid-cap ideas in 2018.''    Jonathan Kees of Summit Redstone began coverage with a ''buy'' recommendation and a price target of $26, adding, ''now is the time to jump in.''   How to grade the Twitter recovery in 2018    Whether daily average user numbers continue to grow    Whether a renewed focus on live events brings in advertisers   In other news: In other news: Twitter banned several accounts tied to Britain First, the far-right group that produced an anti-Muslim video retweeted by Mr. Trump.

Who's Laughing Now?,"The Winklevoss twins have carved an unorthodox path toward fame in the American business world. They went to Harvard University and then on to the Olympics as rowers. Along the way, they fought a legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over the ownership of Facebook. In the Oscar-nominated movie ''The Social Network,'' they were portrayed as uptight gentry, outwitted by Mr. Zuckerberg, the brilliant, budding tech mogul.    Cameron, the left-handed Winklevoss brother, and Tyler, the right-handed one, followed that with a risky bet: They used money from a $65 million settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg to load up on Bitcoin. That turned them into the first prominent virtual currency millionaires in 2013, back when Bitcoin was primarily known as a currency for online drug dealers.   More than a few people in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street saw the towering twins as the naïve -- if chiseled -- faces of the latest tulip bulb mania. Many still do.    But the soaring value of Bitcoin in recent months is giving the brothers a moment of vindication, and quite a bit more than that: Their Bitcoin stockpile was worth around $1.3 billion on Tuesday.   ''We've turned that laughter and ridicule into oxygen and wind at our back,'' Tyler Winklevoss said in an interview last week.   It is unclear how fleeting their vindication, or their fortune, will be. Many Bitcoin aficionados are expecting a major correction to the recent spike in its value, which has gone from $1,000 for one coin at the beginning of the year to around $18,500 on Tuesday.   If nothing else, the growing fortune of the 36-year-old Winklevoss twins is a reminder that for all the small investors getting into Bitcoin this year, the biggest winners have been a relatively small number of early holders who had plenty of money to start with and have been riding a price roller coaster for years. (The mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is believed by researchers to  be holding on to Bitcoin worth around $19 billion.)   Some of these new Bitcoin millionaires are cashing out and buying Lamborghinis, professional hockey teams or even low-risk bond funds. The Winklevoss twins, though, said they had no intention to diversify.   ''We still think it is probably one of the best investments in the world and will be for the decades to come,'' Tyler Winklevoss said. ''And if it's not, we'd rather live with disappointment than regret.''   They have collected an additional $350 million or so of other virtual currencies, most of it in the Bitcoin alternative called Ethereum. The brothers are also majority owners of the virtual currency exchange they founded, Gemini, which most likely takes their joint holdings to a value well over $2 billion, or enough to make each of them a billionaire.   They have sold almost none of their original holdings. While they both have apartments in downtown Manhattan, they say they live relatively spartan lives with few luxuries. Cameron drives an old S.U.V.; Tyler doesn't have a car at all.   The Winklevoss twins' financial rise began during their settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg in 2008. Their lawyers urged them to take the $45 million (after lawyers' fees) in cash. But they wanted to be paid in shares of Facebook.   ''The lawyers thought we were crazy,'' Cameron Winklevoss said last week. ''We thought they were crazy for taking cash.''   By the time Facebook went public in 2012, their stock was worth around $300 million, their rowing careers were over, and they were looking for something new.   When they began buying Bitcoin in late 2012, the price of an individual coin was below $10. Few people in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street had publicly expressed interest in the virtual currency.   Over a few months, the brothers bought 1 percent of all the outstanding Bitcoin at the time -- some 120,000 tokens. As they did, the price soared, making their Bitcoin portfolio worth around $11 million by the time they went public with it in April 2013.   Their buying spree was mocked at the time, and a few of their early decisions fueled that derision. They also invested in Bitinstant, one of the first companies to trade Bitcoins online. Bitinstant's executives, in fact, had tutored the brothers in the basics of Bitcoin.   The chief executive of Bitinstant, Charlie Shrem, was arrested in 2014, accused of helping to supply Bitcoins to users of online drug markets. Mr. Shrem pleaded guilty to lesser charges and was sentenced to a year in jail. The Winklevosses were never implicated in the wrongdoing, which happened before they became investors.   While that drama was unfolding, the twins applied to create the first Bitcoin exchange traded fund, or E.T.F., an investment product that would hold Bitcoins but be traded on stock exchanges. That brought more criticism from people who wondered why someone would buy a fund rather than Bitcoin itself. In March, regulators rejected the application.   On top of all that, until last year the price of Bitcoin was sliding and the virtual currency concept was looking wobbly. But the Winklevosses, who once bet that years of punishing rowing practices would take them to the Olympics, held their ground.   ''We are very comfortable in very high-risk environments with absolutely no guarantee of success,'' Tyler Winklevoss said. ''I don't mean existing in that environment for days, weeks or months. I mean year after year.''   They sold some of their tokens to pay for Gemini, a name that means twins in Latin. Like the Bitcoin E.T.F., their investment in Gemini was driven by their experience with the difficulty of buying and securely storing Bitcoin.   Every Bitcoin sits in an address that can be accessed only with the corresponding password, or private key. The problem with this system is that anyone who gets hold of a private key can easily take the Bitcoin. And unlike money taken from a bank account, stolen Bitcoin are essentially impossible to retrieve. A number of virtual currency exchanges and wallets have collectively lost billions of dollars' worth of Bitcoin to thieves.   The Winklevosses came up with an elaborate system to store and secure their own private keys. They cut up printouts of their private keys into pieces and then distributed them in envelopes to safe deposit boxes around the country, so if one envelope were stolen the thief would not have the entire key.   With Gemini, they have created a high-tech version of this process to hold customer money. Getting into the company's wallets requires multiple signatures from cryptographically sealed devices that were never linked to the internet.   Gemini got a license from New York State regulators that allows them to hold Bitcoins for regulated banks and asset managers -- something essentially no other virtual currency companies can do. That has turned Gemini into one of the most trusted destinations for sophisticated investors.   ''Gemini is an underappreciated exchange, one of the few exchanges I trust as a custodian,'' said Ari Paul, a managing partner at the virtual currency hedge fund BlockTower Capital.   Gemini is now expanding from its old 5,000-square-foot offices to new, 35,000-square-foot facilities in Midtown Manhattan.   This doesn't mean Gemini or the Winklevosses have ironed out all the kinks. Like many other exchanges, Gemini has struggled to stay online in the deluge of new customers in recent weeks.   These growing pains are part of the reason the brothers say they are holding on to their Bitcoin. They believe virtual currencies are still a long way from real mainstream adoption.   They said they might look at selling when the value of all the Bitcoin in circulation approaches the value of all gold in the world -- some $7 trillion or $8 trillion compared with the $310 billion value of all Bitcoin on Tuesday -- given that they think Bitcoin is set to replace gold as a rare commodity. But then Tyler Winklevoss questioned even that, pointing out the ways that he believes Bitcoin is better than gold.   ''In a funny way, I'm not sure we'd even sell there,'' he said. ''Bitcoin is more than gold -- it's a programmable store of money. It may continue to innovate.''   Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper     "
The Can't-Lose Way for Your Business to Pop: Add Bitcoin to Its Name,"It's clear that a business idea is hot when companies that have nothing to do with the idea get involved. It's clear that the idea has turned into a mania when investors reward companies for doing this.  And that's exactly the case these days with Bitcoin and all of its ancillary concepts, including the blockchain, the ledger on which virtual currency transactions are recorded.   As the value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed in recent months, companies previously focused on making fitness apparel, cigars and beverages, among other things, have rebranded themselves as virtual currency or blockchain companies of one sort or another. And investors have cheered them on, pushing their stock prices up.  Here's a look at some of the rebranded companies and their explanations. Long Island Iced Tea Corp.  Long Blockchain Corp.  Long Island Iced Tea made iced teas in flavors including peach and lemon, as well as lemonades. On Thursday, the company, based in Farmingdale, N.Y., said it was shifting its corporate focus to the blockchain. The company said: ""We view advances in blockchain technology as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and have made the decision to pivot our business strategy in order to pursue opportunities in this evolving industry."" (December 21) Vapetek Inc.  Nodechain Inc.  Vapetek made batteries and liquid for electronic cigarettes. In September, it rolled out a candy flavored e-liquid called Rock Kandi. This month, the Nevada-based company renamed itself and said it would shift to mining virtual currencies.  In the company's words: ""We are confident that cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology has a large market opportunity in the coming years and we look forward to growing the company and creating shareholder value, while helping to innovate the future of global currency.""  (December 20)         Bioptix Inc. Riot Blockchain Inc.   Bioptix was a pharmaceutical company until this year. In October, the Colorado company said it was changing its name, making an investment in a Canadian virtual currency exchange and creating operations to mine Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.  The company said that alongside its virtual currency business, it will continue to pursue ""products for cattle, equine and swine for the assistance and facilitation of reproduction."" (October 4)     Croe Inc.  The Crypto Company  To become a public company, The Crypto Company acquired a small existing public company, Croe, which previously developed women's fitness clothing.  The company said this summer that its ""core services include consulting and advising companies regarding investment and trading in the digital asset market and investing in a manner that diversifies exposure to the growing class of digital assets."" (June 9) After the change, the Securities and Exchange Commission, concerned by the company's actions, suspended trading of its stock.  On-line PLC  On-line Blockchain PLC  On-Line was a small British company that previously incubated internet businesses. This fall, the company said it was renaming itself and shifting to focus on virtual currency technology.  The company said: ""Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are a new and exciting area we have been working on for some time to provide systems to support the roll out of these technologies across a range of applications."" (October 26)  Rich Cigars Inc.  Intercontinental Technology Inc.   Rich Cigars previously produced cigars. But the Florida company said this month that it was changing its name, getting out of the cigar business, moving to Colorado and creating  subsidiaries to mine for virtual currencies.  The company said it will be pursuing ""the development of a unique cryptocurrency mining business for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which will operate on a 24/7 basis."" (December 14) 360 Capital Financial 360 Blockchain Inc.  360 Capital Financial provided financial services to companies. In October, the Canadian company announced it would change its name and ticker symbol and begin investing exclusively in blockchain-based companies. The company said: ""We are taking an all-round view to the 360 Blockchain Inc. business plan; with a mission to empower blockchain technologies with capital and experience to create exponential value."" (October 4) Leeta Gold Corp.  Hive Blockchain Technologies  Leeta Gold was focused on mineral exploration in Canada, though with little apparent success. This summer, the company said it was acquiring a Bitcoin mining company, Genesis, with facilities in Iceland and renaming itself.  According to the company: ""This transaction positions HIVE as a leading cryptocurrency miner in an attractive jurisdiction, Iceland, with low energy costs.""

Health Care and Bank Stocks Edge Indexes Lower; Volatile Trading for Bitcoin,"Stocks finished slightly lower on Friday in subdued trading ahead of a three-day holiday weekend. Health care companies and banks slipped. President Trump signed the Republican-backed tax bill into law, but for the fourth day in a row, stocks did not move much. They had made strong gains in recent weeks as investors became more sure the $1.5 trillion package would pass.    High-dividend stocks made small gains even as bond yields remained near their recent highs. The price of bitcoin fell as much as 30 percent after making gigantic gains throughout the year.    The price of bitcoin was down about 8 percent in the late afternoon after trading in a gigantic range between $10,834 and $15,830 during the day, according to the tracking site CoinDesk.   ''The bubble is really in the conversation about bitcoin at this point,'' Brett Ewing, chief market strategist of First Franklin, said. ''If you were to go out and talk to 100 people you know, all of them know about bitcoin. But how many of them actually own it?''   The Standard & Poor's 500-index fell 1.23 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,683.34. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 28.23 points, or 0.1 percent, to 24,754.06. The Nasdaq composite fell 5.40 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,959.96.   The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks dipped 4.18 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,542.93. Those companies, which stand to benefit more than others from lower tax rates, outpaced the market this week.   Stocks are below the record highs they reached on Monday but still finished higher for the fifth week in a row.   Markets will be closed on Monday for Christmas. With just four days of trading left in 2017, stocks are on pace to finish every month of the year with gains, when dividends are included.   Nike slumped $1.48, or 2.3 percent, to $63.29. The company had a strong quarter overall, as both its profit and sales beat Wall Street projections. But Nike's North American business continued to struggle.   Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.48 percent.   Banks took modest losses. They have done far better than the rest of the market as the tax bill has been at the forefront of investors' minds and interest rates have moved higher.   The S&P 1500 banking index, which tracks small, medium and large-sized banks, has soared 9 percent over the last month. The S&P 1500 is up about 3 percent over that time.   The founder of Papa John's, John Schnatter, will step down as the pizza chain's chief executive next month, about two months after he criticized the N.F.L. leadership over national anthem protests by players. The company did not say if the move was related to those comments, for which Mr. Schnatter later apologized.   The chief operating officer, Steve Ritchie, will become chief executive on Jan. 1, while Mr. Schnatter, remains chairman and the company's biggest shareholder. Papa John's stock shed $2.33, or 3.9 percent, to $56.90.   World Wrestling Entertainment dropped $2.32, or 7.3 percent, to $29.55 after the company disclosed that its chairman and chief executive, Vince McMahon, sold 3.3 million shares to raise money for new investments in sports and entertainment, potentially including football.   Benchmark U.S. crude rose 11 cents to $58.47 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, rose 35 cents to $65.25 a barrel in London.   Wholesale gasoline picked up 1 cent to $1.76 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.97 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 7 cents to $2.67 per 1,000 cubic feet.   Gold rose $8.20 to $1,278.80 an ounce. Silver climbed 21 cents to $16.44 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $3.24 a pound.   The dollar fell to 113.31 yen from 113.35 yen. The euro fell to $1.1852 from $1.1873.     "
One of Bitcoin's Biggest Champions Turns Bearish: DealBook Briefing," Good Friday. Here's what we're watching:  One of bitcoin's biggest champion has had a change of heart.     Prosecutors are said to be seeking Kushner records from Deutsche Bank.    Add BofA to the list of companies passing along some of their tax windfall to employees.    A bad day for Bitcoin, just as more people are trying to pile in.    AT&T and Time Warner change the deadline for their $85.4 billion deal.    Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up.   A note to readers: This is the last DealBook Briefing for 2017. Thanks for reading and for your feedback -- we've appreciated every single comment and email. We'll have more in store when we return on Jan. 2. Happy holidays!   One of Bitcoin's biggest champions has had a change of heart.   Michael Novogratz, the former Fortress executive, told Bloomberg that he was shelving plans for a cryptocurrency hedge fund and said Bitcoin will fall to $8,000.   ''We didn't like market conditions and we wanted to re-evaluate what we're doing. I look pretty smart pressing the pause button right now,'' Mr. Novogratz said.   Mr. Novogratz's Galaxy Digital Assets Fund was due to start on Dec. 15.   Bitcoin has fallen more than 40 percent the past four days. It hit a low of $10,776 Friday, down from $19,511 on Monday. The digital currency has since rebounded from its low and was recently at $13,268.   Prosecutors are said to be seeking Kushner records from Deutsche Bank.   Ben Protess, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and David Enrich of the NYT report that Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have sought bank records about entities associated with the family company of Jared Kushner.   In recent weeks, prosecutors from the United States attorney's office in the Eastern District of New York subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank, the giant German financial institution that has lent hundreds of millions of dollars to the Kushner family real estate business.   Mr. Kushner, who was the Kushner Companies' chief executive until January, still owns part of the business after selling some of his stake. The family businesses include many legal entities. It is not clear which records were sought by prosecutors, what they are seeking to learn from them or to what degree, if any, they directly involve Mr. Kushner.   There is no indication that the subpoena is related to the investigation being conducted by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russian meddling in the 2016 United States presidential election.   Click here to read the full story.   Add BofA to the list of companies passing along some of their tax windfall to employees.   The WSJ is reporting that Bank of America is handing out $1,000 bonuses to about 145,000 employees who earn up to $150,000.   President Trump signed the tax bill into law Friday. Since Wednesday when the bill passed Congress, a growing list of companies have announced plans to pass some of their tax windfall to employees.   AT&T and Comcast both will pay a $1,000 bonus to most of their workers in the United States.   Wells Fargo, PNC Financial and Fifth Third are raising their minimum wage to $15. Fifth Third will give $1,000 bonuses to 13,500 of its 18,000 workers, while PNC Financial will pay $1,000 bonuses to about 47,500 employees.   Boeing said it will spend $300 million on employee training, workplace infrastructure, and corporate giving.   Some context on these moves from Breakingviews:    ''Compared to the potential gains from lower taxes, these gestures are trifles. In a very simplified world, cutting the tax rate by 1 percentage point adds almost $2 to the S&P 500's earnings per share, according to Citigroup estimates. Based on a tax rate falling from 35 percent to 21 percent, that's $28 of extra earnings per share -- or $280 billion in total, according to a Breakingviews analysis. Pop that on the historical price-to-earnings multiple of 15, and the biggest American companies ought to be roughly $3.6 trillion more valuable.''   How low can it go?   Bitcoin is down more than 30 percent and is approaching $10,000. The biggest cryptocurrency traded at a high of $19,511 on Monday. The selling has spilled over to other digital currencies. Ethereum and litecoin are off more than 35 percent.   Such tumbles are hardly unusual for bitcoin, which is still up more than 1,300 percent this year.   But the decline has some asking if the top is in. Here are some comments from around the web:   Neil Wilson, ETX Capital, courtesy of MarketWatch: ''Has the bubble finally popped? It's hard to see the bell tolling just yet. We can easily see this market bounce back in very short order. Whilst there have been some hacks, public infighting in the mining community, lots of rumored forks and regulatory pressure building on some fronts, this is likely to be a simple bout of risk-off selling as investors rebalance towards year-end.''   Ross Norman, Sharps Pixley, courtesy of Bloomberg: ''The sharks are beginning to circle here, and the futures markets may give them a venue to strike. Bitcoin's been heavily driven by retail investors, but there'll be some aggressive funds looking for the right opportunity to hammer this thing lower.''   Michael Jackson, Mangrove Capital Partners, courtesy of CNBC: ''The vast majority of long term holders of bitcoin are still way in the money and have shown no sign of cashing out.''   Bitcoin's ''reality check.''   Where Bitcoin was on Sunday: $19,511   Where Bitcoin is this morning: $13,577   What Stephen Innes, the head of Asia-Pacific trading for Oannes, told Richard Frost and Eric Lam of Bloomberg:   ''At the heart of the matter was a frenzied demand for coins with limited supply has now led to unsophisticated investors holding the bag at the top.''   What does a top look like?   Maybe like a host of companies rebranding themselves as having something to do with digital currency or blockchain technology. What gained a huge amount of attention yesterday, of course, was the beverage maker Long Island Iced Tea Corp. announcing that it was changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp. and pivoting to virtual money. (It will still maintain a beverage division, of course.)   What happened was predictable:   But maybe we're not at a top. Shane Chanel, a wealth adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers, told CNN Money that investors may just pile into other digital currencies, adding, ''I feel the cryptocurrency madness is only beginning.''   Goldman Sachs is jumping in   The firm is opening a digital currency trading desk, according to Bloomberg. The firm already clears Bitcoin futures, one of the few banks on Wall Street to do so.   Speaking of a Wall Street firm getting into Bitcoin, who said this late last month?   ''If it works out and it gets more established and it behaves more like a store of value and it doesn't move up and down 20 percent and there's liquidity in it ... you know, we'll get to it.''   Boeing's takeover of Embraer may have just hit some headwinds.   Michel Temer, the president of Brazil, said the government would oppose the sale of a controlling stake in aircraft maker Embraer.   Mr. Temer told reporters:   ''Embraer is Brazilian, it represents Brazil very well abroad. An injection of foreign capital would be welcome. But we won't consider the question'' of a change of control.   Boeing and Embraer said Thursday that they are discussing potential business combinations after The Wall Street Journal reported the two were in takeover talks. A deal that gave Boeing control of Embraer, a crown jewel of Brazilian industry, would need government approval. From The WSJ:   ''The Brazilian government holds a veto over any transaction that would transfer control of the company, which was originally state-owned and still has close ties to the country's military establishment.''   AT&T and Time Warner extend their deal's deadline   The companies now have until June 21 to complete their $85.4 billion transaction, according to a court filing.   They pushed the deadline back after a trial date was set for the Justice Department's lawsuit to block the deal. The court hearings will begin on March 19, which wouldn't give the two enough time to complete their transaction before the previous deadline of April 22.   -- Michael J. de la Merced   Qualcomm rejects Broadcom's slate of directors. Oddsmakers take a beating.   Who didn't see this coming? From the Qualcomm news release:   Broadcom and Silver Lake are asking Qualcomm stockholders to turn over control of their Company now to the hand-picked Broadcom-Silver Lake nominees based on a proposal that dramatically undervalues Qualcomm and is not actionable due to its significant regulatory uncertainty, which may not be resolved for 18 months, if ever, and lack of committed financing. Broadcom has made no commitments to resolve the serious regulatory issues inherent in its proposal.   Expect a lot more fighting between now and March 6, when Qualcomm is scheduled to hold its annual shareholder meeting.   -- Michael J. de la Merced   Does Google still need its ''secretary of state''?   Eric Schmidt was more than the adult in the room during the early days of Google. He was the technology giant's person in Washington, Brussels and Beijing. But does his departure as executive chairman next month mean that his services are no longer vital?   It comes as Alphabet, now Google's parent company, and other tech giants need friends in political capitals around the world -- and Mr. Schmidt's connections to previous administrations like the Obama White House may not be as useful.   From Dai Wakabayashi, Katie Benner and Claire Miller of the NYT:   He has been eclipsed in Washington by others at Google, including Susan Molinari, a former Republican Congresswoman from New York, said some of the people familiar with the company. Google also has new Washington staff members such as Max Pappas, a longtime political operative who has a relationship with Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who support conservative causes.   The personal angle   There was no mention in Google's announcement about why Mr. Schmidt left. But one issue that has hung in the air is the executive's well-known personal life -- including the bringing of girlfriends to corporate events, the World Economic Forum in Davos and other occasions.   The Information reported recently on how the hiring of Marcy Simon, a marketing expert who was in a relationship with Mr. Schmidt, at the company's Android division caused some consternation in the unit.   Critics' corner    Shira Ovide writes, ''Google isn't in desperate need of more adults. But the rest of the technology industry might be.''

Putting Apple's market cap into context   Courtesy of Jeff Sommer and Karl Russell of the NYT:    When adjusted for inflation, Apple's market capitalization just recently surpassed Microsoft's record high. At the heights of the dot-com bubble in 1999, Microsoft's market capitalization peaked at $647 billion.

Steep Drop and Surging Panic Show Bitcoin Has a Flip Side,"You can't exactly say that Bitcoin was burning a hole in anyone's pocket, but the virtual currency burned a hole in quite a few hearts on Friday when it plunged 30 percent in less than 24 hours after defying gravity for the past few months. Many skeptics of the virtual currency, which operates with no government or company in charge, have predicted that it was in bubble territory and due for a collapse.     Still, the drop to around $12,000 a Bitcoin from around $17,500 was enough to set off a panic among buyers, even while stock market investors remained calm and much of the world, unaware that Bitcoin exists, was oblivious to the uproar.   On Reddit, the online forum visited by many Bitcoin followers, people posted phone numbers for suicide hotlines for bereft investors. A popular service that sells Bitcoin to many individual investors went down, overwhelmed by orders.   ''If someone is depressed by the sudden drop in price, remember that many of us are going through the same thing,'' read one post on Reddit, which got more than 400 responses. ''Please don't think nothing crazy. You can use my thread to vent.''   Bitcoins can be used to pay for things online, but they have mostly been treated as an investment because there is a cap of 21 million on the number of Bitcoin that will ever be released. The records of all Bitcoins are maintained by a network of computers around the world. The creator of Bitcoin, someone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, has never been tracked down, though many have tried.   For a time, Bitcoin was known as the currency of drug dealers and other bad actors skulking on the internet. In recent months, hedge funds and ordinary investors around the world have piled into Bitcoin, lured by the promise of a borderless digital investment with no one in charge. That has pushed the price of Bitcoin up from $1,000 at the beginning of the year to more than $19,000 this week, with its run-up raising comparisons to the Dutch tulip mania of the 1600s and the late 1990s dot-com boom.   Yet when the virtual currency, which is highly volatile, experienced its fall late Thursday and early Friday, many of its new fans were unprepared. The downturn hit not just Bitcoin, but almost every other virtual currency that has soared over the last year. Ethereum, and lesser-known tokens like EOS and ZCash, fell even more sharply than Bitcoin.   Vadim Semenov, 24, a programmer in New York, had maxed out the credit lines on two credit cards to buy $35,000 of Bitcoin on Monday, when the currency's price was briefly above $19,000. Bitcoin's dive left him feeling unmoored on Friday morning.   ''I panicked a lot, and was checking everything to find news about why it is dropping,'' he said.   By late Friday morning, he had decided to sit tight. And by Friday afternoon, the virtual currency markets had regained some of their composure, leaving the price of Bitcoin down from earlier in the week -- but still 1,200 percent higher than where it began the year.   Although Bitcoin has left behind some of its associations as a black market currency, the infrastructure surrounding the virtual currency is still largely unregulated and untested.   The flood of new users into the virtual currency in recent weeks has put stress on that loose system. The trading platform Coinbase, a San Francisco company that has become the primary place where ordinary Americans have purchased Bitcoin -- and is one of the most highly regulated companies in the industry -- has gone down at several points under the weight of so many new investors. That happened again on Friday when Bitcoin's price was plunging, leading to agony for many people who wanted to sell along with the rest of the crowd.   For people who have been loudly saying that Bitcoin is a bubble or even a fraud of some sort, Friday's jolt was a vindication.   William F. Galvin, the Massachusetts state securities regulator who has cautioned investors about Bitcoin in the past, put out another warning on Friday. ''Bitcoin is just the latest in a history of speculative bubbles that most often burst, leaving the average investors with a worthless product,'' he said. ''Recent developments indicate that this so-called currency is not a secure investment.''   The volatility appeared to cause some second thoughts for even sophisticated investors.   Michael Novogratz, a former Goldman Sachs partner, said a few months ago that he was starting a $500 million virtual currency hedge fund and expected the price of a Bitcoin to hit $40,000. On Friday, he told Bloomberg that he had called off the plans for the fund because he did not want to deal with the ""schizophrenic emotional side of it.'' He also said he thought Bitcoin could fall as low as $8,000, at least in the short term.   This is not the first time that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been through a boom-and-bust cycle. In 2013, Bitcoin's price rose first to above $200 before crashing. Later that year, an investing mania in China drove the price to another high above $1,200, followed by yet another plunge.   Anyone who got in during those earlier run-ups is still easily in the money. The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, had $11 million of Bitcoin in 2013 and watched it rise to $1.3 billion earlier this week. Even with Friday's declines, those holdings are still worth more than $1 billion.   Longtime investors said that Friday's drama is probably a healthy reminder that Bitcoin is still an investment where people should only have money that they are willing to lose.   ''It's a healthy speed bump that will remind people of the newness of the space, and inherent volatility that goes with it,'' said Chris Burniske, author of the book ''Cryptoassets,'' which is about virtual currencies.   Mr. Semenov, who maxed out his credit cards to buy Bitcoin this week, first got into Bitcoin in 2014 when it was at $700 and sold when it dropped to $300 that year. Watching Bitcoin rise since then is what convinced him not to sell on Friday.   ''I already once made a mistake of dumping everything,'' he said. ''This year definitely showed that adoption is not going to slow down.''   Follow Nathaniel Popper and Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @nathanielpopper and @tiffkhsu.     "
South Korea Takes Steps To Rein In Bitcoin Trades,"Follow Raymond Zhong on Twitter: @zhonggg. South Korea will require people who trade Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to do so under their real names, the country's government said on Thursday, as part of efforts to curb speculation.  Bitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, has been on a gravity-defying bull run over the past few months. The price of a Bitcoin started the year at around $1,000 and topped $19,000 earlier this month, causing swarms of ordinary savers around the world to get in on what remains a largely unregulated -- and highly volatile -- investment.    Nowhere, though, has the frenzy over virtual currencies been as fevered, or as sudden, as in South Korea.   Until recently, markets for Bitcoin and its competitors barely existed in the country. But a spurt of interest has swept up ordinary people from students to retirees. Trading has become so popular that some South Korean exchanges have set up physical storefronts where the uninitiated can learn more and buy in.   Requiring that trading take place using real names brings virtual currencies like Bitcoin more in line with other financial products in South Korea. Although Bitcoin has shed some of its associations with payment for illegal activity, the real-name policy set out on Thursday could also make it easier for the South Korean government to track transactions and to tax capital gains from virtual-currency investments. The price of Bitcoin tumbled after the announcement.   ''Cryptocurrency speculation has been irrationally overheated in Korea,'' the government said in a statement, while adding that officials would discuss further potential moves to stem speculative trading, such as shutting down some virtual currency exchanges. ''The government can't let this abnormal situation of speculation go on any longer.''   The authorities have taken other steps to rein in the market. In September, South Korea's financial regulator banned initial coin offerings, a way for start-ups and online projects to raise money by creating and selling their own virtual currencies.   Government officials, including the prime minister, Lee Nak-yeon, have made no secret of their concerns about investor frenzy.   ''This can lead to serious distortion or social pathological phenomena, if left unaddressed,'' Mr. Lee said after a cabinet meeting in November.   Kim Jin-hwa, who heads an industry association for businesses working with virtual currencies and other applications of blockchain technology in South Korea, said most of the country's virtual currency exchanges could already verify customers' identities via their cellphones. The exchanges, Mr. Kim said, had also worked with banks to develop new measures for ensuring transparency.   The government is more interested in sending a warning to investors about the potentially overheated market, said S. G. Lee, chairman of the Korea Fintech Industry Association.   Mr. Lee, who is no relation to the prime minister, said he believed that the government had been hoping to cool the speculative fervor merely by discussing tighter regulation -- and not by actually implementing too many rules. Officials worry, Mr. Lee said, that more regulation would give virtual currencies greater legitimacy in the eyes of the public, and increase trading activity.   ''It's really tricky for the government,'' Mr. Lee said. ''They are worried about giving a wrong perception to the people.''     "
"Bitcoin Price Soars, Fueled by Speculation and Global Currency Turmoil","SAN FRANCISCO - The virtual currency Bitcoin has been swept up in yet another speculative frenzy, pushing its price toward the peak it last reached in late 2013. The price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like Venezuela, where the local currency has lost much of its value, and India, where the government recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation. More broadly, a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in American and European politics - highlighted by Donald J. Trump's election victory - has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight.  ""The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders,"" said Gil Luria, the director of research at Wedbush Securities. Still, most of the people actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are coming from a single country: China. Some wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their government's strict controls on moving money in and out of the country, according to Bitcoin specialists in China. But the heavy trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, much of it by automated software, suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators. In recent days, the price of a Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges, suggesting more demand in China than outside. The importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday, rather than real world use today, which has generally been hard to quantify. In dollar terms, a Bitcoin was going for about $1,025 on Tuesday, or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016. The volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity, like gold, which has a value resulting from its scarcity. In Bitcoin's case, the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created. The recent rise has brought the price of one Bitcoin to within striking distance of the price of an ounce of gold, which was about $1,150 on Monday. The price has increased in the last year despite the lack of interest in Bitcoin from banks and a majority of more sophisticated investors. After showing early interest in the currency, most big banks have moved on to make investments in the blockchain, the new type of ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin, while eschewing Bitcoin itself. Some central banks have talked about issuing their own national currencies on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that Bitcoin uses. Bitcoin and the blockchain were introduced in late 2008 by a mysterious coder who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Anyone with a computer and internet access can open a Bitcoin wallet and help maintain the blockchain ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Because it is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world, Bitcoin does not require a central authority like a central bank or financial institution. That has made it attractive to people who hope to do financial transactions anonymously, such as the drug dealers who have sold illicit goods for Bitcoin on the Silk Road website and its successors. New Bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the Bitcoin network, and previously released Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world. Since 2009, the price of Bitcoin has generally been defined by long periods of stability marked by short periods of speculative excitement. The only other time the price of Bitcoin has exceeded $1,000 was in late 2013, when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from Chinese investors and traders. The price soon crashed when one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which was based in Tokyo and went bankrupt, announced that it had lost most of the Bitcoins held by its customers (the cause remains in dispute). The Bitcoin price fell to its low - under $200 - in early 2015. Since then, the price has risen in fits and starts, in part because of continuing hacking and fraud, and because of fights over the direction of the Bitcoin network. Many Bitcoin businesses have wanted to edit the basic Bitcoin software to change the number of transactions that can move through the network every day. But the proposed changes have run into opposition from the team of coders responsible for maintaining the basic Bitcoin software. Many Chinese Bitcoin companies have sided with the coders. That disagreement has led to slowdowns on the Bitcoin network, with some transactions taking days to be processed. The slowdowns have made it harder to use Bitcoin for everyday payments. But through the controversy the security of the basic Bitcoin wallets and transaction software has held up, making it a potential alternative for people in countries with less secure currencies and financial institutions. In November, interest in Bitcoin spiked in India after the government announced moves to quickly ban the largest Indian bank notes, in an effort to crack down on corruption. The continued fall in the value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolívar, has led to reports about Venezuelans desperate to exchange their money for Bitcoin. But despite the new demand, the total value of all outstanding Bitcoin, about $16 billion, is still only that of a medium-size American company, and is not large enough to sustain the demand of even a moderate number of Indians or Venezuelans looking to store their wealth in the virtual currency. That points back to the importance of speculators, who are betting that someday soon people worldwide will turn to Bitcoin for their daily financial needs, and push the price much higher. ""I ascribe only 10 percent of the value of Bitcoin to current day usage, and more like 90 percent of it to the expectation of future usage,"" Mr. Luria of Webush Securities said.

How Floyd Mayweather Helped Two Young Guys From Miami Get Rich,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Floyd Mayweather, perhaps the greatest boxer of his generation, is not shy about using social media to display the wealth that his years of prize fighting have won him. On Facebook, you can find videos of Mr. Mayweather draped in diamond chains. Want to see him with blocks of $100 bills taped to his torso? There's that, too. Recently, Mr. Mayweather has shown his appreciation for a new kind of money. In September, he told his 13.5 million followers on Facebook not once but twice that they should buy a new virtual currency known as the Centra token. ""Get yours before they sell out,"" he wrote above a picture of himself admiring the many boxing title belts he had been awarded over the years. ""I got mine and as usual I'm going to win big with this one!""  Mr. Mayweather is among the many celebrities who have recently endorsed an initial coin offering, the name for a hot but loosely regulated new method of fund-raising in which entrepreneurs sell their own virtual currencies to investors around the world. The boxer's endorsement of Centra, along with a similar endorsement from the popular rapper DJ Khaled, lent a patina of credibility to a project that has ended up with more than a few problems, including a chief executive who does not appear to have been a real person and a shaky, fast-shifting business plan. Thanks in part to the endorsements, in just a few weeks Centra's founders raised over $30 million from investors around the world. They finished their fund-raising this month, just before a grand jury indicted two of the three co-founders on perjury charges stemming from a drunken-driving case. Centra was one of the 270 or so I.C.O.s that have raised more than $3.2 billion this year, a 3,000 percent jump from last year's total, according to data from Tokendata.io, which tracks coin offerings. Investors have been willing to pay real money for these virtual tokens because they hope their value will go up as fast as the price of Bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, has in recent months. Celebrities have helped stoke the I.C.O. boom. The actor Jamie Foxx, the socialite Paris Hilton and the soccer player Luis Suarez, for example, have all promoted new virtual currencies to their sizable followings on social media in recent months, offering legitimacy and attention to coin offerings that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. Mr. Mayweather, who has promoted three different tokens -- Centra, Stox and Hubiits -- has even taken to calling himself Crypto Mayweather in social media posts, a play on his better-known nickname, Money Mayweather. But the story of Centra illustrates that beneath the signs of mainstream acceptance, coin offerings still exist in a legal gray zone with few checks on the ambitions of young entrepreneurs. ""It's undeniable that a celebrity endorsement brings a new audience into the world of crypto currencies,"" said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a nonprofit that advocates for Bitcoin and related technology. ""But I'm not certain that celebrity endorsements are doing a good job of bringing attention to the legitimate projects."" Coins of the Digital Wild West The original virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a digital token -- with no physical backing -- that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. The network on which Bitcoin is stored and transferred was designed to operate without any company or government in charge, governed by a far-flung collaboration of volunteer programmers and computers that maintain all the records. Initial coin offerings have taken advantage of the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and another popular virtual currency network, Ethereum. People can pay for tokens like Centra using Bitcoin and Ether (the currency inside Ethereum), and no financial authority needs to approve the payments or even know they happened. Coin offerings have also copied the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are riding on the coattails of tech industry enthusiasm for those currency systems. The Centra founders said their token would fuel a new virtual currency debit card and online market. Some venture capitalists have said these new tokens could provide a way to fund and support new global networks -- like the next generation of the internet. But while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone through years of public vetting (and still have plenty of critics), the new tokens being sold in recent months are unproven, and marketed on the promises of their creators. The creators of Centra are 26-year-old friends from southern Florida, Sam Sharma and Raymond Trapani. The company's chief marketing officer, Robert Farkas, was recently given the title of co-founder as well. Before Centra, neither Mr. Sharma nor Mr. Trapani had any professional experience with the technologies associated with virtual currencies, or with the debit cards they were hoping to build. The primary business experience of Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas was at Miami Exotics, a luxury car rental business that the two built. Mr. Trapani's old Instagram account shows that he was also a credit repair specialist with a penchant for pictures of luxury cars and stacks of $20 bills. ""You can sit and watch my life, or you can join my team and live a life like mine!"" he wrote in one post. The lack of experience in the virtual currency industry did nothing to limit the ambitions of Centra's founders. In July, they put out a website and an announcement that described Centra as an answer to the proliferation of virtual currencies. ""Centra Tech has a brilliant solution, the world's first Debit Card that is designed for use with compatibility on 8+ major cryptocurrencies blockchain assets,"" the announcement said. Making up for the inexperience of the young men was an older chief executive named Michael Edwards, at least according to the Centra website at the time. The first cracks in the project appeared in early August when a programmer, Harry Denly, wrote on his blog that Mr. Edwards appeared to be made up. The photo on Centra's website was a photo of a Canadian physiology professor who had no relation to Centra -- and none of the details on Mr. Edwards's LinkedIn profile, like his work experience at Bank of America and Wells Fargo, checked out. Centra initially threatened to sue Mr. Denly but then said the bad profiles were the result of freelancers who had hastily put together the company's marketing material. The LinkedIn profile was deleted. The company has since removed any mention of Michael Edwards from the Centra site and elevated Mr. Sharma to be president. The company also deleted several other employees whose identity and existence were challenged on social media forums. ""When I got involved, the website got cleaned up from A to Z,"" Mr. Sharma said in an interview. Centra charged past these hiccups and began its token sale, got its endorsement from Mr. Mayweather (more on that later) and moved ahead with its plans for a virtual currency debit card. The debit card was described as a new product that would make it possible to spend virtual currencies anywhere Visa cards were taken. The company's site showed Centra cards emblazoned with the Visa logo. There was one problem with this plan. The company had not been approved, or had even applied, to run a Centra card on the Visa network, a spokeswoman for Visa said. After The New York Times reached out to Visa this month, Centra took all the mentions of Visa off its website. Mr. Sharma then said in an interview that the company had shifted its strategy and was now planning to run its cards on the Mastercard network in partnership with a Canadian financial institution. He said this would not require approval from Mastercard because the Canadian institution would issue the cards. But a Mastercard spokesman, Brian Gendron, disagreed. ""Centra would need approval from Mastercard for something like that, and we are not aware of any approval that has been sought or achieved,"" Mr. Gendron said. Because Centra began raising money without going through any standard background checks, no one verified the company's credentials with the credit card networks or other relevant authorities. A basic background check would have turned up the numerous run-ins with the law that Mr. Sharma, the company president, has had. Mr. Sharma has been sued in Florida and New York several times on allegations of unpaid bills and business deals gone sour. Twice, people have accused him in court of trying to fraudulently sell or lend them cars that he didn't own, and twice he has been evicted for claims that he failed to pay rent. The landlord in Boca Raton, Fla., who evicted him, Steven Fern, said that after Mr. Sharma stopped paying the rent on his condominium, Mr. Sharma promised repeatedly that he would make it up the next month. ""He stayed the entire time, literally until the day the police came,"" Mr. Fern said. ""It was a strange scenario, and we lost a lot of money."" Mr. Sharma said that these problems, a few years ago, had happened when he was ""a kid."" He said the landlord's statements were ""not accurate."" Sprite, Pinot Grigio and a White Maserati For now, the bigger problem facing Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani is the perjury indictment by a Manhattan grand jury on Oct. 5, just a few days after Centra finished fund-raising. The charges stem from an incident last year in Manhattan, when Mr. Sharma was arrested early on a Friday in a white Maserati. According to a local news report, Mr. Sharma ran a stop sign and had ""a flushed face, a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and watery and bloodshot eyes, and was unsteady on his feet."" Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani both said during Mr. Sharma's trial that on the night in question, Mr. Sharma had only had Sprite and one glass of pinot grigio, according to the indictment. ""As defendant Sharma and defendant Trapani knew, the testimony that defendant Trapani gave was false, and the truth was that on March 24, 2016, there were alcoholic beverages other than pinot grigio on the table and the defendant did not order Sprite,"" the indictment said. Mr. Sharma said that he couldn't speak to the case because it was still going on, but that it should not have any effect on Centra. ""I'm obviously not comfortable with that situation,"" he said. ""But it's not that I did something so intensely crazy that investors need to worry."" He and Mr. Trapani both said they were moving ahead with their big plans for Centra, including more projects with Mr. Mayweather. Mr. Trapani said the company was connected with Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled through social contacts in Miami. Mr. Trapani said Mr. Mayweather was so intrigued by Centra's technology that he wanted to be paid in Centra tokens, and wanted to be a partner for future business ventures. ""He'll do anything we ask,"" Mr. Trapani said. ""He'll go shopping around Beverly Hills if we ask him to do it with this card."" The boxing champ understood their deal differently. A spokeswoman for Mr. Mayweather, Kelly Swanson, said he had been paid in cash for the posts and was not involved in any continuing relationship with Centra. She did not say how much he had been paid. After being contacted by The Times, Mr. Mayweather deleted his Instagram and Facebook posts endorsing Centra, though he left up a Twitter post. Mr. Sharma disputed the account of Mr. Mayweather's spokeswoman and said the boxer had received Centra tokens. ""We dealt with Floyd directly through my guy,"" Mr. Sharma said. ""It was a very direct, individual deal."" Representatives for DJ Khaled did not respond to requests for comment. Other celebrities have already learned the risks of associating with initial coin offerings. In September, Ms. Hilton endorsed a token known as Lydian Coin on Twitter, where she wrote: ""Looking forward to participating in the new @LydianCoinLtd Token!"" Ms. Hilton deleted the post after Forbes reporters uncovered the checkered legal past of the founder of Lydian Coin, who had aimed to raise $100 million. Regulators have been relatively slow to crack down on problematic coin offerings. But the Securities and Exchange Commission did recently bring its first case against what it claimed was a fraudulent project -- a relatively small one that collected a few hundred thousand dollars. For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them. Mr. Sharma shared and proved his ownership of the Ethereum wallet where they are currently keeping the money. Assuming regulators don't step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they don't build anything. But they say that won't happen. Mr. Sharma said Centra was planning to issue its first batch of debit cards this year, regardless of the denials of Visa and Mastercard, and would unveil its broader technology in November. They have already rented lavish offices in Miami Beach and hired several people. ""I see us taking over as being the No. 1 company that people will use to use their crypto assets,"" Mr. Sharma said, using an industry term for virtual currencies. ""Once our proof of concept goes from beta to live, I think that we are going to take market dominance in the full aspect."" Some potential investors did not share Mr. Sharma's enthusiasm and discussed their concerns on Reddit and other social media platforms. But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled. ""What's important is Centra is being endorsed and they have a product,"" a Reddit user named islandsurf wrote back to the critics, explaining his own investment. ""That's what matters to investors!"" Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter @nathanielpopper Doris Burke contributed research.

Bitcoin Expansion Is Off the Table. At Least for Now.,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A long-running civil war over the design of Bitcoin appears to be over for now, after one side in the fight acknowledged on Wednesday that it had not won sufficient support from other virtual currency backers. The camp that conceded had been hoping to double the number of transactions that could be run through the network that supports Bitcoin, in order to keep transactions cheap and fast.  This expansion was vociferously opposed by many of the programmers working on the Bitcoin project, who worried that expanding the network quickly would make it easier for a company or government to exert influence over the decentralized system. The group pushing for expansion had planned to switch to a new version of the Bitcoin software next week, which would have created a split in the network and most likely wreaked havoc on the virtual currency. This planned split, though, was called off on Wednesday, after the companies proposing it failed to win significant support from the Bitcoin community. In an email, the leaders of several of the largest Bitcoin companies said that ""unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time."" The price of Bitcoin shot up immediately after the email went out, hitting a new high, above $7,800, before retreating. The price has been steadily climbing and is up nearly 1,000 percent over the last year. The rising price has attracted many new users, from places like Japan and South Korea and from big hedge funds, even as the authorities in places like China have cracked down on the currency. All of the new people seeking access to Bitcoin have run up against a limit on the number of transactions that can flow through the system every 10 minutes, which was put in place during Bitcoin's early years. Because of the limit, the network can process only around five transactions a second. That has led to delays on the network and has pushed up the price of getting a Bitcoin transaction through. Companies that help process Bitcoin payments have been pushing to lift the limit on Bitcoin transactions for several years, arguing that it will be necessary if Bitcoin wants to compete with Visa or PayPal. The opposing camp has argued that quickly expanding the number of transactions flowing through the network would mean only large companies could track Bitcoin transactions, taking power away from individual users. The proponents of keeping the so-called blocks of Bitcoin transactions small said Bitcoin should be viewed more as digital gold: a secure place to keep money, even if it can't be moved around as quickly and cheaply. Many of the programmers working on the basic Bitcoin software -- the so-called core developers -- said they would stop working on Bitcoin if the block size was increased. They also complained that the companies pushing through the block size increase were doing so without properly consulting the community. Leaders on both sides of the Bitcoin debate have complained about receiving death threats and hacking attacks, and some top developers have migrated toward other virtual currencies. In August, some of the most outspoken proponents of expanding Bitcoin created their own version, known as Bitcoin Cash, which can handle more transactions than traditional Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin Cash has gone up since August, but it remains only a small fraction of the size of Bitcoin. On Wednesday, the companies that had been pushing for big blocks said they were calling off their plans in order to restore some measure of peace to the community. ""Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger block size, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together,"" the email said. The announcement said that the companies still believed that an increase in the size of Bitcoin blocks would be necessary, but that they were willing to wait until the community agreed on a way to deal with the issue. The people opposed to quickly expanding the network say they still wanted to make it easier and cheaper to use Bitcoin. But they hope this will be made possible by new networks built on top of Bitcoin, keeping the Bitcoin network itself more secure and decentralized.

Initial Coin Offerings Horrify a Former S.E.C. Regulator,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Members of the Securities and Exchange Commission's staff have been hearing recently from a former colleague with an urgent question: Why aren't you cracking down on these initial coin offerings? Initial coin offerings are a relatively new method that entrepreneurs have used to raise money for start-ups, by selling custom-built virtual currencies. The practice has taken off this year, despite the warnings of regulators and the uncertainty of the rules concerning the fund-raising method. Joseph Grundfest, who was a commissioner at the S.E.C. in the 1980s and is now a law and business professor at Stanford, said he had been contacting current commission officials and staff to urge them to bring cases, and fast.  ""I.C.O.s represent the most pervasive, open and notorious violation of federal securities laws since the Code of Hammurabi,"" Mr. Grundfest said in an interview. ""It's more than the extent of the violation,"" he said. ""It's the almost comedic quality of the violation."" A spokeswoman for the S.E.C. did not respond to a request for comment. Start-ups have raised more than $3 billion this year from investors through coin offerings. Most start-ups say the coins they are selling will be useful as a method of payment in the online services they are building. Coin offerings generally happen without the involvement of financial institutions or regulators because investors pay for the coins using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, which can be sent outside the traditional financial system. Regulators in China and South Korea have recently banned such offerings outright. In the United States, the S.E.C. has brought one case against a small fraudulent coin offering. The agency has also warned that at least some coins being sold could be considered securities, and would be in violation of securities law if not registered with the authorities -- and few are. But Mr. Grundfest, who is also a co-director of the Rock Center for Corporate Governance, said the continuing flow of new coin offerings showed that the warnings were not nearly enough. ""We're waiting to see a whole bunch of enforcement actions in this space, and we wonder why they haven't happened yet,"" he said. ""I hope what they are doing is planning on a sweep of 50 I.C.O.s."" Mr. Grundfest is far from the only voice who has criticized the frenzy around coin offerings. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who has expressed enthusiasm about Bitcoin, has said he thinks that ""99 percent of I.C.O.s are a scam,"" a sentiment that other leading venture capitalists have echoed. But Mr. Grundfest's words could carry more weight, both because he is close to the technology world near Stanford and because he knows what it takes to bring federal securities cases. He said the most obvious way for regulators to go after initial coin offerings would be to label them as securities and punish them for not registering with the authorities. The chairman of the S.E.C., Jay Clayton, said in a talk this month that the agency was planning to crack down on offerings that violated securities law, including virtual coins that should be categorized as securities but have not been registered with the authorities. ""Where we see fraud, and where we see people engaging in offerings that are not registered, we are going to pursue them because these types of things have a destabilizing effect on the market,"" Mr. Clayton said in a meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Mr. Grundfest said that he would welcome this, but that he did not think it should have taken this long. ""These are not hard cases,"" he said. ""You don't need teams of accountants poring over complex financing documents."" Many companies offering coins have argued that they are not securities because they will have utility on the networks the companies are building. But Mr. Grundfest said it was clear that almost everyone buying tokens at this point was buying them with the hope that their value would go up, not because the buyer wanted to use them on some future computer network. Mr. Grundfest said he thought that the concept of a coin offering could be a useful innovation for certain types of fund-raising. It could, he said, make sense for a company building a decentralized cloud storage network, which could then use the coin as a means of payment and record keeping on the network. But he said almost none of the projects currently raising money through coin offerings had a need for the novel structure. ""Is this amazing technology? Yes,"" he said. ""But most of the stuff we see today is total crap."" Mr. Grundfest said several teams looking at doing offerings had approached him to ask how to do it right. ""I say, 'Look, you are at very high risk for violating the securities law,' and explain why,"" he said. ""Then they go find another lawyer."" Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.

Bitcoin's Price Has Soared. What Comes Next?,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Bitcoin has been in a bull market like few the world has ever seen. At the beginning of the year, the price of a Bitcoin was below $1,000. It hit $5,000 in October, then doubled by late November. And on Thursday, less than two weeks later, the price of a single Bitcoin rose above $20,000 on some exchanges, according to Coinmarketcap. The latest price spike has been credited to signs that Wall Street companies plan on bringing their financial heft into the market.  At the current cost, the value of all Bitcoin in circulation is about $300 billion. To get a sense of how big that is, all the shares of Goldman Sachs are worth about $90 billion. The gains have been driven by several other factors -- perhaps the most important being the irrational mentality that can take over in speculative bubbles. But most people buying Bitcoin are doing so in the belief that others will want it even more in the future. The gains, though, have many people, even Bitcoin believers, anticipating a big crash. Bitcoin used to be all about libertarians and black-market trade. Are those still driving the price? The fringe communities that drove Bitcoin in its early years are playing a much less important role in the current rally. Many investors have said the most important factor driving the current enthusiasm is the entry of hedge funds and other institutional investors. The path for large investors has been smoothed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange, which have been racing to roll out Bitcoin futures contracts. Most banks are already signed up with these exchanges and consequently can immediately begin trading the contracts. The options exchange has said it plans to start trading on Sunday. It is still unclear how the arrival of Bitcoin futures will influence the demand for the digital tokens. With a futures contract, banks can bet on the price of Bitcoin without holding the underlying Bitcoins. This is expected to bring many new players into the market who don't want to deal with the complications of holding Bitcoins. But the futures contract will also allow investors to short Bitcoin, or bet on the price's going down, which has been hard to do until now. Some analysts think this could put downward pressure on the price. Other market participants have worried that Bitcoin futures could spread the risks of Bitcoin into the rest of the financial system. People still use Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to make ransom payments and buy illegal goods online, including synthetic opioids. But that activity has been on the wane since the authorities shut down some of the largest online black markets this year. What role are smaller investors playing in the virtual currency markets? Individual investors have been just as active as large investors. Nowhere has the phenomenon of ordinary people buying virtual currencies been more visible than in South Korea, where several exchanges have storefronts to help new customers. This is all the more remarkable because just a year ago, Koreans showed almost no interest in these markets. Small Japanese investors have also been investing in Bitcoin. They have been encouraged by laws passed this year that essentially legalized Bitcoin and allowed Bitcoin exchanges to get regulatory licenses. In the United States, most small-time investors have gone to the San Francisco company Coinbase, which provides a Bitcoin brokerage service, similar to Charles Schwab, as well as an exchange for larger investors. Coinbase now has more account holders than Schwab, and it has struggled to keep up with the growth. China used to be the most active country for Bitcoin trading and mining, but the authorities there have cracked down this year. What are the dangers of getting into this market? Many of the largest exchanges, including in South Korea, are essentially unregulated. The lack of oversight means that no one is checking that the exchanges are properly securing their customers' money or that large players are not able to manipulate the price. One of the largest exchanges in the world, Bitfinex, has been hacked numerous times and provides little transparency about where it is keeping its money. Even regulated exchanges, like Coinbase in the United States, have not been battle tested like larger financial institutions, and their operations have gone down at key moments. Once people buy Bitcoin or other virtual currencies, they are often targeted by hackers who have become experts at penetrating Bitcoin accounts. Bitcoin ""wallets"" are vulnerable to new kinds of attacks that are not a problem for ordinary financial accounts. Most important, in contrast to money in a bank account, when a Bitcoin is gone there is essentially no way to get it back and no insurance covering its loss. Are more people using Bitcoin to pay for things? When Bitcoin was released in 2009, it was described as a new kind of electronic cash. Recently, though, many programmers working on Bitcoin have said the system in its current form is not a particularly good way to pay for things. They argue that it is best designed to serve as a sort of scarce commodity, like digital gold, allowing people to keep their money outside the control of governments and companies. Many people who want to use virtual currencies for online payments are looking to Bitcoin competitors, like Bitcoin Cash and Monero. What role are the other virtual currencies playing in this frenzy? Earlier this year, bullish sentiment was focused on Ethereum, a virtual currency network that is more adaptable than Bitcoin. The price of Ether, the virtual currency on the Ethereum network, has continued to rise in recent months, but not as fast as Bitcoin. Many investors were also putting their money into custom virtual currencies released by entrepreneurs in so-called initial coin offerings. These new virtual currencies have generally been designed to serve as the internal payment mechanisms on new software the entrepreneurs are building. This fall, though, regulators have signaled that they are planning to crack down on coin offerings. Where did virtual currencies come from, and how do they work? The Bitcoin software was released in early 2009 by a mysterious creator who went by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. The search is still on for the true identity of Satoshi. The software released by Satoshi set out the basic rules for Bitcoin and the computer network on which it lives. Unlike other forms of money, which are controlled by governments and financial institutions, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network of computers that no one institution controls.

South Korea Clamps Down on Bitcoin Trading Amid Market Frenzy,"South Korea will require people who trade Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to do so under their real names, the country's government said on Thursday, as part of efforts to curb speculation. Bitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, has been on a gravity-defying bull run over the past few months. The price of a Bitcoin started the year at around $1,000 and topped $19,000 earlier this month, causing swarms of ordinary savers around the world to get in on what remains a largely unregulated -- and highly volatile -- investment. Nowhere, though, has the frenzy over virtual currencies been as fevered, or as sudden, as in South Korea.  Until recently, markets for Bitcoin and its competitors barely existed in the country. But a spurt of interest has swept up ordinary people from students to retirees. Trading has become so popular that some South Korean exchanges have set up physical storefronts where the uninitiated can learn more and buy in. Requiring that trading take place using real names brings virtual currencies like Bitcoin more in line with other financial products in South Korea. Although Bitcoin has shed some of its associations with payment for illegal activity, the real-name policy set out on Thursday could also make it easier for the South Korean government to track transactions and to tax capital gains from virtual-currency investments. The price of Bitcoin tumbled after the announcement. ""Cryptocurrency speculation has been irrationally overheated in Korea,"" the government said in a statement, while adding that officials would discuss further potential moves to stem speculative trading, such as shutting down some virtual currency exchanges. ""The government can't let this abnormal situation of speculation go on any longer."" The authorities have taken other steps to rein in the market. In September, South Korea's financial regulator banned initial coin offerings, a way for start-ups and online projects to raise money by creating and selling their own virtual currencies. Government officials, including the prime minister, Lee Nak-yeon, have made no secret of their concerns about investor frenzy. ""This can lead to serious distortion or social pathological phenomena, if left unaddressed,"" Mr. Lee said after a cabinet meeting in November. Kim Jin-hwa, who heads an industry association for businesses working with virtual currencies and other applications of blockchain technology in South Korea, said most of the country's virtual currency exchanges could already verify customers' identities via their cellphones. The exchanges, Mr. Kim said, had also worked with banks to develop new measures for ensuring transparency. The government is more interested in sending a warning to investors about the potentially overheated market, said S. G. Lee, chairman of the Korea Fintech Industry Association. Mr. Lee, who is no relation to the prime minister, said he believed that the government had been hoping to cool the speculative fervor merely by discussing tighter regulation -- and not by actually implementing too many rules. Officials worry, Mr. Lee said, that more regulation would give virtual currencies greater legitimacy in the eyes of the public, and increase trading activity. ""It's really tricky for the government,"" Mr. Lee said. ""They are worried about giving a wrong perception to the people."" Follow Raymond Zhong on Twitter: @zhonggg.

'Our Phones Are Being Monitored',"One morning earlier this year, I got a call from Mario E. Patrón, a prominent human rights lawyer in Mexico. He wanted to talk in person. When he arrived at The New York Times's Mexico bureau, he took a seat in the conference room and asked me for my phone. He then collected the phones of everyone else in the room, walked them outside and placed them in our lobby. Out of earshot. ''Our phones are being monitored,'' he told me. Mr. Patrón went on to explain that he and two other lawyers on his staff at Centro Prodh, including the one representing the families of 43 students missing from a teachers college in Ayotzinapa, had been targeted by highly sophisticated spyware that could take over a cellphone, including the microphone. The spyware, known as Pegasus, could monitor calls, emails, calendar appointments and even encrypted messages. It essentially turned a phone into a personal bug.     Mr. Patrón then introduced me to Luis Fernando García, a digital rights activist who had been tracking the use of the software against activists, journalists and others. He showed me more cases where he suspected individuals had been targeted. I got suspicious that perhaps others had also been targeted, and went looking myself.   As described in an article beginning on the front page, we found that many people were targeted: anti-corruption academics, journalists and the family members of at least two of those who were targeted, including the teenage son of Carmen Aristegui, one of the country's most prominent reporters. Nearly every person I interviewed did the same thing Mr. Patrón had -- moved their phones into a separate location.   The messages that were sent to Ms. Aristegui -- which included a link to click on that would then install the spyware -- especially interested me. As I reviewed them, I began to panic. I'd received identical messages, I recalled, and I remembered clicking on one of them. The link was broken, and I was taken to a blank page. I thought little of it at the time -- this was before there had been any reporting on the NSO Group, an Israeli cyberarms manufacturer that made the software, and the suspected misuse of it by the Mexican government. But for months after, my phone often malfunctioned. Dropped calls, calls that would not connect, apps suddenly shutting down. It got bad enough that I wiped the phone.   Of course, that meant we could never check to see if the phone had been targeted. I no longer had the original message with the link to check; and if the software had indeed been downloaded, it was now erased. I continued working, but used a separate phone to conduct my research.   In researching the software, I realized that the person who had written the most about NSO was my own colleague, Nicole Perlroth. ''I first heard about NSO Group at a security conference a couple years ago,'' she said. ''A stranger I met at the conference told me that they were the best at what they did -- mobile surveillance -- which surprised me because I'd been covering cybersecurity for four years and had never heard of them. 'That's why they're the best' was the response.''   When Nicole started asking her sources about NSO Group, ''without fail, the person would turn noticeably skittish,'' she said.   I reached out to Nicole to share what I had, and we decided to team up. In our research, we realized that if the government of Mexico was misusing this spyware, which NSO maintains is sold only to governments and only for use against terrorists and criminals, there was no way to know it. Not even NSO would know. The company cannot track how its clients use -- or abuse -- the software.   Once NSO's tools make their way into government hands, it is left to governments to police themselves -- an example of a larger problem. ''To this day there is still no global body regulating the use of spyware,'' Nicole said. ''It's been mostly left to journalists to uncover instances of abuse.''   ''These tools are only spreading to more governments, many of them with terrible human rights records,'' she added. ''It's distressing to know that we're probably only skimming the surface.''     "
Mexico Opens Investigation Into Spying,"MEXICO CITY -- The Mexican government said Wednesday that it was opening a criminal investigation to determine whether the nation's most prominent journalists, human rights defenders and anticorruption activists were subjected to illegal government surveillance.  The announcement followed an article by The New York Times that detailed a sweeping operation using advanced spyware to infiltrate a target's smartphone, turning it into a power surveillance tool.    The software, known as Pegasus, was sold to the Mexican government by an Israeli cyberarms company on the condition that it be used for the sole purpose of investigating criminals and terrorists. But the spyware was deployed against some of Mexico's most influential reporters and activists, including a highly respected academic pushing for anticorruption legislation, two of Mexico's most famous journalists and lawyers looking into the case of 43 students who mysteriously disappeared after clashing with the police.   Forensic analysts at digital rights groups in Mexico and at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School, found that the surveillance operation had also swept up an American citizen, as well as the family members of some government critics, including a teenage boy living in the United States.   Pressure built quickly on the government to take action, with victims of the spyware and others calling for an independent investigation into the surveillance. The forensic analysts say there is little doubt that the Mexican government, or some rogue actor within it, is behind the surveillance attempts. But while the software is sold only to governments, with special precautions to ensure that it can be used only by the agencies that buy it, there is no ironclad proof of the Mexican government's hand in the spying.   Activists said that the government's announcement of an investigation, which will be conducted by the attorney general's office, fell far short of their demands.   To begin with, the attorney general's office is among the various Mexican agencies that purchased the software, raising the question of whether it will thoroughly investigate itself.   The office heading up the investigation is in charge of crimes against the freedom of expression, tasked with looking into crimes against journalists and human rights defenders. In recent months, it has largely focused on the rising number of murdered reporters.   The government replaced the office's head prosecutor a few days after a separate Times article showed that the federal government had hardly prosecuted any cases, even though Mexico is among the deadliest places in the world to be a journalist. The Committee to Protect Journalists had also pressed the government on the issue, and had met with Mexico's president to demand stronger steps to safeguard the nation's reporters.     "
"A Plagiarism Case With Sex, Lies and Spyware","Emma Cline's 2016 novel ''The Girls'' was, by any measure, a triumphant debut. The novel, which takes place in California in the 1960s and centers on a teenage girl who falls into a Charles Manson-like cult, sold to Random House for seven figures in a three-book deal, and spent three months on the New York Times best-seller list. Ms. Cline, who was 27 when the novel came out, was celebrated as a major new talent. But for the last two years, her success has been overshadowed, in private, by legal threats levied against her by a former boyfriend, Chaz Reetz-Laiolo.    This week, that long simmering dispute became glaringly public, when Ms. Cline and Mr. Reetz-Laiolo filed dueling lawsuits in federal court in San Francisco. In his complaint, Mr. Reetz-Laiolo, who is also a writer, claims that Ms. Cline plagiarized phrases and scene structures from him that appear in ''The Girls,'' and used spyware to read his email and other personal documents. Ms. Cline's publisher and Scott Rudin Productions, which optioned the screen rights to ''The Girls,'' are also named in the suit, which seeks unspecified damages.    Ms. Cline's countersuit calls the claims ''ludicrous,'' and says that the suit was motivated by jealousy, and marks the culmination of Mr. Reetz-Laiolo's continuing effort to threaten and intimidate her into paying him a large sum of money.   Random House issued a statement in support of Ms. Cline, saying that ''there is no basis to the plagiarism claims made by Mr. Reetz-Laiolo and we look forward to presenting our arguments in court.''   Her literary agent, Bill Clegg, called the legal dispute ''heartbreaking and enraging'' in a statement provided to The New York Times, and noted that Ms. Cline was already developing the themes and framework for ''The Girls'' before she met Mr. Reetz-Laiolo.   The complaint filed by Ms. Cline notes that many of the instances of overlapping phrases that Mr. Reetz-Laiolo contends were stolen from him are minimal and in some cases consist of only two words (like ''heavy rear'' and the word ''Doomsville''). It argues that her use of spyware to read his emails was prompted by her suspicions that he was being unfaithful to her and not, as Mr. Reetz-Laiolo claims, as a way to surreptitiously read and copy his work. Ms. Cline's lawyers have requested at least $75,000 in damages and asked that the copyright claims be dismissed.   The unusual and dramatic legal clash over ''The Girls'' is far from a standard copyright complaint. There are high-powered lawyers representing both parties, in a convoluted dispute that includes accusations of physical and emotional abuse and charges of digital spying and invasion of privacy.   Mr. Reetz-Laiolo is represented by Boies Schiller Flexner, which also represented the disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein and helped him in his efforts to quash the sexual harassment allegations against him. Ms. Cline's team of lawyers includes Carrie Goldberg, a prominent lawyer and advocate who specializes in representing women who have been victims of harassment and ''revenge porn,'' or online sexual shaming. (Ms. Goldberg is also representing the actress Paz de la Huerta, who has accused Mr. Weinstein of raping her and is bringing a criminal case against him.)   The accusations leveled in Ms. Cline's countersuit in many ways overshadow Mr. Reetz-Laiolo's own claims that his intellectual property was taken, and suggest a pattern of intimidation, abuse and threats of public humiliation.   The countersuit details alleged abusive behavior by Mr. Reetz-Laiolo, including a claim that in 2012, after reading a text message on her phone that he interpreted as flirtatious, he held her down on the bed and choked her so hard she could not breathe, and later threw her belongings into the street. (Ms. Cline appears to have recently referred to this episode, without naming Mr. Reetz-Laiolo, in an essay she wrote about sexual harassment for New York magazine.)   In a statement provided to The Times by his lawyers, Mr. Reetz-Laiolo denied what he called ''false accusations of physical abuse against me,'' and said that Ms. Cline and her lawyers had not provided a defense against his claims of digital spying, as well as those of his co-plaintiffs, two women who were friends of Mr. Reetz-Laiolo, who also say that Ms. Cline used spyware to read their emails.   Ms. Cline's countersuit contends that Mr. Reetz-Laiolo has repeatedly threatened to release embarrassing personal information about her.   Ms. Cline, who grew up in Sonoma, Calif., met Mr. Reetz-Laiolo, then 33, in 2009, when she was a 20-year-old student at Middlebury College. Their relationship ended in 2012, but they stayed in touch.   In the fall of 2014, after she had sold her novel to Random House, he told her that since she had become so successful, people might be interested in naked photographs of her that he had obtained when they were a couple, and that he was going to write a tell-all article about their relationship, Ms. Cline's complaint says.   An earlier draft of Mr. Reetz-Laiolo's complaint included details about Ms. Cline's personal life, taken from her old computer, which she had sold to him when they were still friendly. The complaint included screen shots of sexually explicit messages and details about her sexual fantasies, and threatened to expose her as the author of an erotic story she published online under a pseudonym.   ''Reetz-Laiolo has attempted to leverage this trove of personal data as a weapon to shame and falsely accuse Cline. And his allegations follow a pattern that started during their relationship -- and apparently fits with the playbook of his counsel -- of prying into and exploiting Cline's sexual history to threaten her, even going so far as to make the false and absurd claim that she was an 'escort,''' the countersuit says.   The firm representing Mr. Reetz-Laiolo was co-founded by David Boies, who represented Vice President Al Gore in the United States Supreme Court case that followed the 2000 election. But more recently, Mr. Boies has come under scrutiny for his work representing Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Boies helped the producer hire a private investigation firm to undermine news articles about Mr. Weinstein's sexual harassment and misconduct toward women, according to a report in The New Yorker. (The Boies firm has also provided legal counsel to The New York Times; the paper recently ended its relationship with him following the revelations of the work he did for Mr. Weinstein.)   Mr. Boies's name was at the top of an earlier draft of the complaint from May, which referred to Ms. Cline's ''use of her sexuality to extract compensation and manipulate older men.'' The complaint featured screen shots of sexual explicit messages she had sent to past lovers, and used their names.   Details from a second draft of the complaint were first reported by The New Yorker, which published an article about Mr. Boies's involvement in the suit against Ms. Cline. The explicit material is not included in the filed complaint, and Mr. Boies is no longer listed as one of the lawyers.   ''The addition of the sexually explicit content in the second draft complaint served no purpose other than to coerce Emma into a settlement,'' said Ms. Goldberg. ''They were threatening to file this as a lawsuit, making it public, and that's as good as saying we're going to be disseminating this to the entire world.''   Lawyers for Mr. Reetz-Laiolo counter that the details about her sexual past were made relevant to their copyright suit when Ms. Cline made issues of her own character and Mr. Reetz-Laiolo's treatment of her.   ''Ms. Cline's lawyers are attempting to manipulate the important national conversation about sexual harassment to muddy the clear case of Ms. Cline's plagiarism and illegal activity,'' Boies Schiller Flexner said in a statement. ''We addressed this topic only in response, and then only in confidential communications with Ms. Cline's lawyers.''   To Ms. Cline and her lawyers, the inclusion of such material in legal communication appeared to be a thinly veiled threat that she would face public humiliation unless a settlement was reached.   ''What should have been a happy milestone -- publishing my first novel -- has turned into a yearslong nightmare perpetrated by someone I believed I had finally escaped from,'' Ms. Cline said in a statement to The Times. ''My only experience of publishing a novel has been one where I am under acute attack, with my sexual history weaponized against me by a cadre of male lawyers. I'll never be able to get back the years I've now spent responding to an ex-boyfriend's baseless legal assaults and ludicrous, billion-dollar claims instead of writing another book. That's a loss I don't know how to fully comprehend.''   Follow New York Times Books on Facebook and Twitter (@nytimesbooks), and sign up for our newsletter.     "
Google Ends Scanning Of Gmail To Aim Ads,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Google plans to abandon its longstanding practice of scanning user email in its Gmail service to serve targeted advertising. Google said it does not scan the email of paying corporate customers of its G Suite of services, but it made the policy change -- announced in a company blog post on Friday -- on its free consumer version to eliminate confusion and create one uniform policy toward Gmail.     As it builds its Google Cloud business for selling internet infrastructure and services to corporate customers, Google is trying to ease concerns that it will use data from corporate customers to help its mainstay advertising business.   Google said it plans to carry out the changes to the Gmail ad policy ''later this year.'' It will continue to scan Gmail to screen for potential spam or phishing attacks as well as offering suggestions for automated replies to email.   The company will continue to serve ads in Gmail, which has more than 1.2 billion users, but it will target those ads based on information it has already gathered from other Google services like search or YouTube, instead of the content of email.   ''This decision brings Gmail ads in line with how we personalize ads for other Google products,'' Diane Greene, Google's senior vice president in charge of Google Cloud, wrote in the post.   Google introduced Gmail in 2004, and it quickly gained popularity because it offered improved search options and more storage, eliminating the inconvenience of deleting email to stay within capacity limits. Gmail is now the most widely used web email service.   But the service has been criticized by privacy advocates for scanning email to generate contextually aware ads. The ads in email bothered users more than other targeted advertising found across the web, because users are more touchy about the privacy of email versus, for example, browsing history.   ''This action was driven by concerns from business users -- not regular individuals,'' said Seth Schoen, a senior staff technologist from the Electronics Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. ''Some of the regular people who use Google services disliked the way their email contents were being used to target ads way back in 2004. Yet their concerns couldn't get much traction until Google became aware 13 years later that some current or prospective paying enterprise customers were uncomfortable with this practice.''   The decision to stop combing email to distribute specific ads in Gmail is a sign of Google's seriousness in winning over corporate customers to use its internet infrastructure and services. Ads still represent a vast majority of Google's revenue, but the company sees Google Cloud as a growth area.   Google had said its policy was not to target ads in Gmail based on personal information, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial data, and that information extracted from a user's email will only be used for ads in Gmail. Users may now opt out of receiving personalized ads in Gmail, but they may not opt out of email scanning.     "
Questions About Mac Security and Google Password Prompts,"Q. I am getting a pop-up message claiming to be from Google and asking for my password. It says: ''Google Password Required. Enter your password for [account name] in Internet Accounts.'' It won't go away, even if I restart my Mac. Is this malware?   A. If you get Gmail through the Mac's Mail app and the program is having a problem, the Internet Accounts box from the System Preferences often pops up to ask for the password in order to reconnect the Mail program with the Gmail server. You may also see the Internet Accounts box if you have a Google Play, YouTube or other Google service linked to your Mac. Click the System Preferences icon in the Mac's desktop dock and then click the Internet Accounts icon to go directly to the settings.    Google recently confirmed that a technical issue had caused a number of users to get booted out of their Google accounts. Signing back in with your password should fix the problem.   If you are concerned about your Mac's security, log into your Gmail account on another computer or device to make sure your password still works. (This would also be a good time to update and change your Google password: After you log into Gmail, go to https://myaccount-google-com.ezproxy.lib.ryerson.ca for the password settings, and to configure two-step verification.)   If you have recently changed your Gmail password through a web browser and did not update the Mac's Mail program, you may also see alert boxes asking for the password. If you previously set up application-specific passwords, you may have to update the Mail program with that app password.   Malicious software can be very good at impersonating legitimate messages from the operating system, browser, mail program and other applications -- and despite some protections, Macs are not invulnerable. Free utilities like Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac or Avast Free Mac Security can scan your system, as can commercial security suites like those from Intego or Norton.

Ditching Pop-Up Ads and Scareware Alerts on the iPad,"Q. In the column about fake security alerts that won't go away, that was good advice for Windows and Mac users, but what about iPad users? There are no Option, Command or Escape keys on an iPad.   A. If an aggressive pop-up alert or ad invades your iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch screen, you have a few ways to get rid of the intrusive window. In the iOS version of Safari, try closing the browser tab by tapping the pages icon in the toolbar. When the thumbnail images of the open pages appear, tap the ''x'' in the top corner of the page to close that tab. You can also press and hold the Done button in the corner of the window until a menu pops up inviting you to close all the open tabs.    As another approach, try leaving. If you can get to the browser's address bar, tap into it, type in a new URL and jump to another website.   Some pop-ups may be tenacious. As with desktop programs, you can force-quit iOS apps if the ad or scareware alert will not go away. To do that, double-click the home button. The iOS device should then display small versions of your open app windows on screen. If the web browser is not the first one in the stack, swipe through the thumbnails until it is in the center of the screen. When the browser is front and center, swipe up on the screen until its preview thumbnail disappears.   Clearing the Safari browser's history can wipe out lurking URLs that may take you back to the problematic site with the pop-ups. Note that clearing history also removes website cookies and other data, so you may have to re-enter passwords for some sites. To clear your Safari history, go to the home screen, open the Settings icon, select Safari and tap ''Clear History and Website Data.''   The Safari settings also include a Block Pop-Ups control you can enable. In iOS 9 and later, you can also install third-party content blockers from Apple's App Store to filter out invasive elements.

Scanning QR Codes With iOS 11,"Q. How do you get out of a fake tech-support scam page without having to reboot the whole computer? A. Depending on the malware powering the fraudulent page and your browser settings, you have a few escape routes. Some malicious pages can be particularly persistent in trying to scam you, by repeating audio loops about ''infections'' and interfering with shortcuts for closing page tabs. If you have your browser set to automatically reopen page tabs, you may also be back where you started from with the unwanted page even after you quit the program and open it again.     Should the common methods of evading aggressive web pages fail you -- like quitting the program or closing the tab -- move up to the system utilities for shutting down misbehaving apps. Press the Control, Alt and Delete keys (or the Control, Shift and Escape keys) to get to the Task Manager on a Windows PC or press the Command, Option and Escape keys on a Mac to open the Force Quit Applications box so you can exit the browser.   If you find the malware is interfering with your ability to use those system management tools, shut down the whole computer (holding down the power button often works), but disable your internet connection before you restart the computer. You can do this by temporarily turning off your wireless router or unplugging your Ethernet cable. When you start up your system again without an internet connection, the browser should not be able to reload the malicious page.   Now, close the offending tabs and adjust your browser's settings so the program does not to reopen the same pages when you start it again. When you have done that, restore your internet connection. As a general precaution after the encounter, scan your computer with your system's antivirus program -- some poisoned sites can download malicious software before you realize it, so an up-to-date security solution is essential for modern web browsing.   Fraudulent technical-support pages have become increasingly sophisticated and assertive, and most use realistic graphics and social engineering to trap nontechnical users. To help educate the public, Microsoft has created a Tech Support Scams page with videos, examples and advice on how to recognize and report these types of sites.   Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.

Daily Report: The Treasure Found in Email,"Email is dead; long live email. In his State of the Art column on Wednesday, Farhad Manjoo, the technology columnist for The New York Times, examines the controversy over Donald Trump Jr.'s email thread in which he was told that Russian government officials could provide dirt on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The emails have raised questions about just how much Russia influenced November's election.     The flap is also a reminder of the perils of email, and how messages can come back to bite you. Anything recorded is hard to eliminate -- the messages can be forwarded or saved, and they are never truly deleted. So if you have something sensitive to discuss, an old-fashioned phone call or an in-person meeting might be the better way to go. Email should go the way of the dodo for secure communications, Farhad writes.   Yet Farhad also reflects on what we would lose if email were to fade away. Because email is intimate and convenient, it has produced ''an unmatched historical record of some of the most important stories in the world,'' he writes. ''It preserves time, location and state of mind, the what-when-where-and-who of every story we might want to dig up.''   In other words, the transparency that email can provide will be sorely missed if everyone switches over to encrypted messaging apps and other secure communications channels for handling sensitive information.   So long live email? Not exactly -- but at least savor Donald Trump Jr.'s emails as email's last hurrah.     "
Trump Inherits Secret Cyberwar on North Korea,"WASHINGTON -- Three years ago, President Barack Obama ordered Pentagon officials to step up their cyber and electronic strikes against North Korea's missile program in hopes of sabotaging test launches in their opening seconds. Soon a large number of the North's military rockets began to explode, veer off course, disintegrate in midair and plunge into the sea. Advocates of such efforts say they believe that targeted attacks have given American antimissile defenses a new edge and delayed by several years the day when North Korea will be able to threaten American cities with nuclear weapons launched atop intercontinental ballistic missiles.    But other experts have grown increasingly skeptical of the new approach, arguing that manufacturing errors, disgruntled insiders and sheer incompetence can also send missiles awry. Over the past eight months, they note, the North has managed to successfully launch three medium-range rockets. And Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, now claims his country is in ''the final stage in preparations'' for the inaugural test of his intercontinental missiles -- perhaps a bluff, perhaps not.    An examination of the Pentagon's disruption effort, based on interviews with officials of the Obama and Trump administrations as well as a review of extensive but obscure public records, found that the United States still does not have the ability to effectively counter the North Korean nuclear and missile programs. Those threats are far more resilient than many experts thought, The New York Times's reporting found, and pose such a danger that Mr. Obama, as he left office, warned President Trump they were likely to be the most urgent problem he would confront.   Mr. Trump has signaled his preference to respond aggressively against the North Korean threat. In a Twitter post after Mr. Kim first issued his warning on New Year's Day, the president wrote, ''It won't happen!'' Yet like Mr. Obama before him, Mr. Trump is quickly discovering that he must choose from highly imperfect options.   He could order the escalation of the Pentagon's cyber and electronic warfare effort, but that carries no guarantees. He could open negotiations with the North to freeze its nuclear and missile programs, but that would leave a looming threat in place. He could prepare for direct missile strikes on the launch sites, which Mr. Obama also considered, but there is little chance of hitting every target. He could press the Chinese to cut off trade and support, but Beijing has always stopped short of steps that could lead to the regime's collapse.   In two meetings of Mr. Trump's national security deputies in the Situation Room, the most recent on Tuesday, all those options were discussed, along with the possibility of reintroducing nuclear weapons to South Korea as a dramatic warning. Administration officials say those issues will soon go to Mr. Trump and his top national security aides.   The decision to intensify the cyber and electronic strikes, in early 2014, came after Mr. Obama concluded that the $300 billion spent since the Eisenhower era on traditional antimissile systems, often compared to hitting ''a bullet with a bullet,'' had failed the core purpose of protecting the continental United States. Flight tests of interceptors based in Alaska and California had an overall failure rate of 56 percent, under near-perfect conditions. Privately, many experts warned the system would fare worse in real combat.   So the Obama administration searched for a better way to destroy missiles. It reached for techniques the Pentagon had long been experimenting with under the rubric of ''left of launch,'' because the attacks begin before the missiles ever reach the launchpad, or just as they lift off. For years, the Pentagon's most senior officers and officials have publicly advocated these kinds of sophisticated attacks in little-noticed testimony to Congress and at defense conferences.   The Times inquiry began last spring as the number of the North's missile failures soared. The investigation uncovered the military documents praising the new antimissile approach and found some pointing with photos and diagrams to North Korea as one of the most urgent targets.   After discussions with the office of the director of national intelligence last year and in recent days with Mr. Trump's national security team, The Times agreed to withhold details of those efforts to keep North Korea from learning how to defeat them. Last fall, Mr. Kim was widely reported to have ordered an investigation into whether the United States was sabotaging North Korea's launches, and over the past week he has executed senior security officials.   The approach taken in targeting the North Korean missiles has distinct echoes of the American- and Israeli-led sabotage of Iran's nuclear program, the most sophisticated known use of a cyberweapon meant to cripple a nuclear threat. But even that use of the ''Stuxnet'' worm in Iran quickly ran into limits. It was effective for several years, until the Iranians figured it out and recovered. And Iran posed a relatively easy target: an underground nuclear enrichment plant that could be attacked repeatedly.   In North Korea, the target is much more challenging. Missiles are fired from multiple launch sites around the country and moved about on mobile launchers in an elaborate shell game meant to deceive adversaries. To strike them, timing is critical.   Advocates of the sophisticated effort to remotely manipulate data inside North Korea's missile systems argue the United States has no real alternative because the effort to stop the North from learning the secrets of making nuclear weapons has already failed. The only hope now is stopping the country from developing an intercontinental missile, and demonstrating that destructive threat to the world.   ''Disrupting their tests,'' William J. Perry, secretary of defense in the Clinton administration, said at a recent presentation in Washington, would be ''a pretty effective way of stopping their ICBM program.''    Decades in the Making   Three generations of the Kim family have dreamed that their broken, otherwise failed nation could build its own nuclear weapons, and the missiles to deliver them, as the ultimate survival strategy. With nukes in hand, the Kims have calculated, they need not fear being overrun by South Korea, invaded by the United States or sold out by China.   North Korea began seeking an intercontinental ballistic missile decades ago: It was the dream of Kim Il-sung, the country's founder, who bitterly remembered the American threats to use nuclear weapons against the North during the Korean War.   His break came after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when out-of-work Russian rocket scientists began seeking employment in North Korea. Soon, a new generation of North Korean missiles began to appear, all knockoffs of Soviet designs. Though flight tests were sparse, American experts marveled at how the North seemed to avoid the kinds of failures that typically strike new rocket programs, including those of the United States in the late 1950s.   The success was so marked that Timothy McCarthy of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey wrote in a 2001 analysis that Pyongyang's record ''appears completely unique in the history of missile development and production.''   In response, President George W. Bush  in late 2002 announced the deployment of antimissile interceptors in Alaska and California. At the same time, Mr. Bush accelerated programs to get inside the long supply chain of parts for North Korean missiles, lacing them with defects and weaknesses, a technique also used for years against Iran.   Threat Grows in Obama Era   By the time Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, the North had deployed hundreds of short- and medium-range missiles that used Russian designs, and had made billions of dollars selling its Scud missiles to Egypt, Libya, Pakistan, Syria, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. But it aspired to a new generation of missiles that could fire warheads over much longer distances.   In secret cables written in the first year of the Obama administration, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out the emerging threat. Among the most alarming released by WikiLeaks, the cables described a new path the North was taking to reach its long-range goal, based on a missile designed by the Soviets decades ago for their submarines that carried thermonuclear warheads.   It was called the R-27. Unlike the North's lumbering, older rockets and missiles, these would be small enough to hide in caves and move into position by truck. The advantage was clear: This missile would be far harder for the United States to find and destroy.   ''North Korea's next goal may be to develop a mobile ICBM that would be capable of threatening targets around the world,'' said an October 2009 cable marked ''Secret'' and signed by Mrs. Clinton.   The next year, one of the new missiles showed up in a North Korean military parade, just as the intelligence reports had warned.   By 2013, North Korean rockets thundered with new regularity. And that February, the North set off a nuclear test that woke up Washington: The monitoring data told of an explosion roughly the size of the bomb that had leveled Hiroshima.   Days after the explosion, the Pentagon announced an expansion of its force of antimissile interceptors in California and Alaska. It also began to unveil its ''left of launch'' program to disable missiles before liftoff -- hoping to bolster its chances of destroying them. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced the program, saying that ''cyberwarfare, directed energy and electronic attack,'' a reference to such things as malware, lasers and signal jamming, were all becoming important new adjuncts to the traditional ways of deflecting enemy strikes.   He never mentioned North Korea. But a map accompanying General Dempsey's policy paper on the subject showed one of the North's missiles streaking toward the United States. Soon, in testimony before Congress and at public panels in Washington, current and former officials and a major contractor -- Raytheon -- began talking openly about ''left of launch'' technologies, in particular cyber and electronic strikes at the moment of launch.   The North, meanwhile, was developing its own exotic arsenal. It tried repeatedly to disrupt American and South Korean military exercises by jamming electronic signals for guided weapons, including missiles. And it demonstrated its cyberpower in the oddest of places -- Hollywood. In 2014, it attacked Sony Pictures Entertainment with a strike that destroyed about 70 percent of the company's computing systems, surprising experts with its technical savvy.   Last month, a report on cybervulnerabilities by the Defense Science Board, commissioned by the Pentagon during the Obama administration, warned that North Korea might acquire the ability to cripple the American power grid, and cautioned that it could never be allowed to ''hold vital U.S. strike systems at risk.''    Secret Push, and New Doubts   Not long after General Dempsey made his public announcement, Mr. Obama and his defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, began calling meetings focused on one question: Could a crash program slow the North's march toward an intercontinental ballistic missile?   There were many options, some drawn from General Dempsey's list. Mr. Obama ultimately pressed the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to pull out all the stops, which officials took as encouragement to reach for untested technologies.   The North's missiles soon began to fail at a remarkable pace. Some were destroyed, no doubt, by accident as well as by design. The technology the North was pursuing, using new designs and new engines, involved multistage rockets, introducing all kinds of possibilities for catastrophic mistakes. But by most accounts, the United States program accentuated the failures.   The evidence was in the numbers. Most flight tests of an intermediate-range missile called the Musudan, the weapon that the North Koreans showed off in public just after Mrs. Clinton's warning, ended in flames: Its overall failure rate is 88 percent.   Nonetheless Kim Jong-un has pressed ahead on his main goal: an intercontinental ballistic missile. Last April, he was photographed standing next to a giant test-stand, celebrating after engineers successfully fired off a matched pair of the potent Russian-designed R-27 engines. The implication was clear: Strapping two of the engines together at the base of a missile was the secret to building an ICBM that could ultimately hurl warheads at the United States.   In September, he celebrated the most successful test yet of a North Korean nuclear weapon -- one that exploded with more than twice the destructive force of the Hiroshima bomb.   His next goal, experts say, is to combine those two technologies, shrinking his nuclear warheads to a size that can fit on an intercontinental missile. Only then can he credibly claim that his isolated country has the know-how to hit an American city thousands of miles away.   In the last year of his presidency, Mr. Obama often noted publicly that the North was learning from every nuclear and missile test -- even the failures -- and getting closer to its goal. In private, aides noticed he was increasingly disturbed by North Korea's progress.   With only a few months left in office, he pushed aides for new approaches. At one meeting, he declared that he would have targeted the North Korean leadership and weapons sites if he thought it would work. But it was, as Mr. Obama and his assembled aides knew, an empty threat: Getting timely intelligence on the location of North Korea's leaders or their weapons at any moment would be almost impossible, and the risks of missing were tremendous, including renewed war on the Korean Peninsula.   Hard Decisions for Trump   As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump complained that ''we're so obsolete in cyber,'' a line that grated on officials at the United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, where billions of dollars have been spent to provide the president with new options for intelligence gathering and cyberattacks. Now, one of the immediate questions he faces is whether to accelerate or scale back those efforts.   A decision to go after an adversary's launch ability can have unintended consequences, experts warn.   Once the United States uses cyberweapons against nuclear launch systems -- even in a threatening state like North Korea -- Russia and China may feel free to do the same, targeting fields of American missiles. Some strategists argue that all nuclear systems should be off limits for cyberattack. Otherwise, if a nuclear power thought it could secretly disable an adversary's atomic controls, it might be more tempted to take the risk of launching a pre-emptive attack.   ''I understand the urgent threat,'' said Amy Zegart, a Stanford University intelligence and cybersecurity expert, who said she had no independent knowledge of the American effort. ''But 30 years from now we may decide it was a very, very dangerous thing to do.''   Mr. Trump's aides say everything is on the table. China recently cut off coal imports from the North, but the United States is also looking at ways to freeze the Kim family's assets, some of which are believed held in Chinese-controlled banks. The Chinese have already opposed the deployment of a high-altitude missile defense system known as Thaad in South Korea; the Trump team may call for even more such systems.   The White House is also looking at pre-emptive military strike options, a senior Trump administration official said, though the challenge is huge given the country's mountainous terrain and deep tunnels and bunkers. Putting American tactical nuclear weapons back in South Korea -- they were withdrawn a quarter-century ago -- is also under consideration, even if that step could accelerate an arms race with the North.   Mr. Trump's ''It won't happen!'' post on Twitter about the North's ICBM threat suggests a larger confrontation could be looming.   ''Regardless of Trump's actual intentions,'' James M. Acton, a nuclear analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, recently noted, ''the tweet could come to be seen as a 'red line' and hence set up a potential test of his credibility.''

How to Win the Information War,"Nina Jankowicz is a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center's Kennan Institute. WASHINGTON -- Since the American presidential election, RT and Sputnik, Russia's state-funded foreign media networks, have dominated the discussion about the United States' response to Russian disinformation. This month, the American government debated whether those outlets should be categorized as foreign agents; a recent article in The New York Times Magazine labeled RT ''the most effective propaganda operation of the 21st century so far.'' Many Americans seem increasingly to embrace the belief that snuffing out these networks and otherwise responding directly to Russian fakes will win the information war. It won't. To win this fight, Americans need to think seriously about why RT, Sputnik and ''fake news'' resonate with so many people in the first place.     RT and Sputnik are bellwethers for the progressing American policy response to disinformation. On Sept. 14, Molly McKew, a writer and consultant who describes herself as an ''information warfare expert,'' testified before Congress that these ''media outlets'' and others ''deep within the shadow space'' have infected America. In response, Ms. McKew would have us ''develop a rapid response capability for irregular information warfare'' to ''secure our information space.'' She also recommended more regulation for social media.   Unfortunately, these views are shared by many people who work in the burgeoning anti-fake-news field. They discuss responding directly to Russia by restricting speech, flagging false information on public platforms and opening centers to counter disinformation. The creation of a Western media antidote to RT is floated regularly, even though the channel has only about eight million viewers in the United States each week. (While it has more viewers on YouTube, they are largely brought in by memes or disaster videos, not news.)   What no one seems to care to discuss is the people who are targets of Russian disinformation, why its narratives find fertile ground among them and what can be done to change that.   According to the Pew Research Center, only 20 percent of Americans trust their government. The same low percentage has ''a lot'' of trust in the national news media. It's impossible to say definitively what causes this mistrust, but its growth has coincided with the rise of both the adrenaline-driven internet news cycle and the dying of local journalism over the past two decades. Without news that connects people to their town councils or county fair, or stories that analyze how federal policies affect local businesses, people are left with news about big banks in New York and dirty politics in Washington.   Readers compare this coverage with their dwindling bank balances and crumbling infrastructure and feel disconnected and disenfranchised, and latch onto something -- anything -- that speaks to them. That might be President Trump's tweets. Or dubious ''news'' from an extreme right- or left-wing site might ring true. Or they might turn to Russian disinformation, which exploits this trust gap.   All is not lost. Disinformation can be defeated without the establishment of a shiny new initiative cased in the language of Cold War 2.0. Instead of ''rapid information operations,'' the United States should work to systematically rebuild analytical skills across the American population and invest in the media to ensure that it is driven by truth, not clicks.   The fight starts in people's minds, and the molding of them. In K-12 curriculums, states should encourage a widespread refocusing on critical reading and analysis skills for the digital age. Introductory seminars at universities should include a crash course in sourcing and emotional manipulation in the media. Similar courses could be created as professional development for adults, beginning with state employees. Large corporations could be offered government incentives to participate, too.   Training like this has a proven track record. In Ukraine, IREX, a nongovernmental organization, trained 15,000 people in critical thinking, source evaluation and emotional manipulation. As a result, IREX measured a 29 percent increase in participants who double check the news they consume. Another neighbor of Russia, Finland, has been resistant to Russian influence in part because of its media education program, which begins in childhood.   The American government should also work to level the information playing field, increasing its investment in public broadcasters and demanding a hefty financial commitment from companies like Facebook and Twitter -- the unwitting agents of Russia's information war -- to support the proliferation of local, citizen-focused journalism. If social networks are unwilling to be the arbiters of truth (despite 45 percent of American adults' getting news from Facebook), they should at the very least provide grants to reporters who cover the local issues that most immediately affect people's lives and donate advertising to small outlets that cannot compete with national media giants.   Finally, under no circumstances should the United States attempt to restrict freedom of the media. The United States might label RT or Sputnik a foreign agent, but it should never ban them. It also need not reinvent the wheel by creating an American version of RT. These would be grave mistakes that would erode America's position as a beacon of free speech. They would contribute to the crisis of trust that makes Russian disinformation successful in the first place.   Russia has very deftly exploited America's weaknesses -- but these are weaknesses of our own making. Until policy makers start putting people at the heart of their fight against disinformation, they will continue to be easy targets for Russian lies.     "
Is France the Latest Front in Russia's Information War?,"Follow Elian Peltier on Twitter: @ElianPeltier. PARIS -- Minutes after it began broadcasting on Monday night, the new television channel RT France took aim at the country and its president, Emmanuel Macron. ''President Assad accuses France of supporting terrorism,'' the scroll at the bottom of the screen stated.    France and the United States are part of a coalition committed to removing Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, and Mr. Assad has accused France of merely prolonging Syria's civil war, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives since 2011.    It was a classic rhetorical gambit by RT, the Russian public broadcaster formerly known as Russia Today, which is ultimately financed by the Kremlin. Detractors say that RT is part of a disinformation campaign that  peddles exaggerations and untruths to undermine confidence in Western institutions and destabilize democracy itself.   ''Ideally for the Russian authorities, the main goal remains to increase the public's distrust toward their political elite and their media, in order to end up paralyzing the decision making process,'' said Julien Nocetti, a research fellow who specializes in Russia at the French Institute for International Relations.   Others said the launch of the channel could bring fresh air to a crowded yet homogeneous media landscape.   ''RT France is going to reach a very limited audience and its repercussions will be minimal, but a contradictory voice never hurts,'' said Thierry Vedel, a researcher on media pluralism and democracy at Sciences Po. He added that France's four main news channels shared a similar agenda, making it unusual for them to provide innovative coverage.   ''A new vision is always interesting, until it becomes dangerous,'' he said.   A prerecorded interview of President Emmanuel Macron that aired on public television channel France 2 on Sunday night drew much criticism on social media for its soft questions and its obedient tone. On Twitter, a Paris correspondent for the Reuters agency called it ''deferential journalism at its worst,'' echoing a widespread feeling here that the mainstream media have been too complacent toward Mr. Macron, a young and media-savvy president whom critics call the ''president of the rich'' and who has openly argued that a powerful presidency is needed to revive French greatness.   ''A day after the interview of the French head of state by the French state television, TV Macron has no lesson to give to TV Putin,'' a prominent media critic, Daniel Schneidermann, wrote in a reference to the France 2 interview.   In response to increased wariness about their network, RT executives emphasized the need for an alternative take on international news.   With its slogan ''Dare to question,'' the channel will push viewers to think outside of what RT's station manager and editor in chief, Xenia Fedorova, called the ''information bubble of the mainstream media.''   ''There's always another side of the story, but there is a lack of that alternative point of view here,'' Ms. Fedorova said in a phone interview, pointing out to the lack of coverage about Russia's involvement in the Syrian war as an example.   The launch of the French channel has come under high scrutiny from national authorities.   At a joint news conference with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, in May, President Emmanuel Macron of France dubbed the network and internet news agency Sputnik as ''organs of influence and deceitful propaganda,'' and accused their journalists of spreading ''defamatory untruths.''   Earlier this year, a United States intelligence report said the Kremlin-funded network used the internet and social media to conduct ''strategic messaging for the Russian government.''   ''We will be constantly monitoring it,'' Olivier Schrameck, the head of France's broadcasting regulatory body, the Conseil Supérieur de l'Audiovisuel, told journalists last month about RT's French channel, adding that it would react quickly in the event of any ''anomaly.''   Russia Today was founded in 2005 and launched RT US in 2010. It now has six channels that broadcast in English, Spanish and Arabic. The network says it reaches 700 million people in over 100 countries.   The French channel will operate with a budget of 20 millions euros and an expected staff of 50 journalists for a total of 150 employees both for the channel and the existing French website by the end of 2018. Around 50 journalists are already working in spacious, new offices that include a newsroom and two studios in Western Paris, close to the offices of the BBC and the French channel Canal+.   For its first day on air, the channel covered two years of Russian intervention in Syria and the increasing isolation of the U.S. after its veto at the U.N., among other topics. It broadcast a French subtitled version of RT's documentary ''North Korea: The happiest people on earth,'' and aired an interview with the American filmmaker Oliver Stone about his documentary on Mr. Putin.   The channel invited former French presidential candidate and euroskeptic politician Nicolas Dupont-Aignan -- who gathered less than five percent of the vote in the first round of the election this year. The channel provided little in the way of on-the-ground reporting, except for street interviews that asked people in France what they thought of RT's launch in their country.   Most of the interviewees had never heard about RT. Media experts said they expected the channel to attract a limited audience for its first months on air: The channel only broadcasts on Free, France's fourth largest television operator. A second operator will host the channel by the end of February, while the two others, SFR and Orange, are still in negotiations with the network   Executives of RT want to tap into a growing audience in France, where it launched a website in 2015 that last year grew faster than any of RT's six foreign-language sites, a spokesman for the network  said in March.   For its nightly newscasts, the channel's executives have hired Stéphanie de Muru, a former top host from BFM TV, France's leading news channel. Another notable hire was Jacques Sapir, an economist and editorialist who writes for the Kremlin-backed Sputnik news agency.     "
"In His Volleys, Trump Echoes a Provocateur","Way back on Friday, President Trump declared that several news organizations -- ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC, The New York Times -- were ''the enemy of the American people.'' You know who's not the enemy, in his book? Alex Jones.    Mr. Jones, in case you aren't aware, is the conspiracy-theorizing, flame-throwing nationalistic radio and internet star who's best known for suggesting that Sept. 11 was an inside job, that the Sandy Hook school shooting was ''completely fake'' and that the phony Clinton child-sex trafficking scandal known as Pizzagate warranted serious investigation (which one Facebook fan took upon himself to do, armed with an AR-15).   Mr. Jones, 43, has been around for a while. Like every media outfit in the Trump era, his platforms have gotten record traffic and, he told me last week, seen increases in revenue, with ads for water purification systems and for supplements to enhance ''brain force'' and virility.   But he is apparently taking on a new role as occasional information source and validator for the president of the United States, with whom, Mr. Jones says, he sometimes speaks on the phone.    Millions of listeners and viewers tune in to Mr. Jones on his websites (Infowars chief among them), on Facebook and through old-fashioned radio, and their loyalty partly explains how Mr. Trump maintains a hard-core faithful who don't believe a word they read about him in a newspaper like this one.   His audience, Mr. Jones told me, is ''the teeth of the Trump organization on the ground -- the information-warfare, organic internal resistance.'' Sure enough, on Saturday the journalist McKay Coppins of The Atlantic tweeted from Florida, ''Spotted at Trump rally: More than one InfoWars t-shirt.''   Spotted at Trump rally: More than one InfoWars t-shirt -- McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) February 18, 2017   Where Mr. Jones's content fits in Mr. Trump's broad media diet isn't clear. White House officials declined to talk about it in detail. (Hey, Mr. President, I'm trying.) But as Mr. Trump pushes full steam ahead on his effort to delegitimize American journalism, he is lending credence to a number of out-there Jonesisms, adding yet another ''pinch yourself, this is happening'' element to our national journey into the upside-down.   You can look no further than Mr. Trump's description of the press as ''the enemy of the American people'' on Friday, which was reminiscent of Mr. Jones's use of the same phrase in 2015, as Mr. Jones noted on Sunday on Twitter.   Poweful! @realDonaldTrump calls out the true enemy in this video report. https://t.co/GdXh5lR9mO and I coin it 2015. https://t.co/UCGxZJDybu -- Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) February 19, 2017   Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump's quickly debunked allegation that the news media covered up terrorism by Islamic extremists echoed reports on Infowars, including one headline that blared: ''Scandal: Mass Media Covers Up Terrorism to Protect Islam.''   ""Where does he get this stuff?"" pic.twitter.com/kvHmWElwUS -- Brandt (@UrbanAchievr) February 6, 2017   Before that, there was Mr. Trump's false claim that millions of unauthorized immigrants voted illegally for Hillary Clinton, which Infowars had asserted in November and then repeated, giving ''oxygen to the lies,'' as CNN put it then. Then again, others in the right-leaning internet ecosystem had forwarded the illegal voting report, too.   Mr. Jones's influence could be seen more directly last spring when Mr. Trump told a crowd in California that ''there is no drought'' -- oh, yes, there was -- and suggested that reports of one were part of a plot to protect a ''three-inch fish.'' It was very similar to reports in Infowars suggesting the drought was manufactured and promoting the fish theory.   Mr. Jones demurred when it came to his influence on Mr. Trump, which he said the ''MSM'' (mainstream media) overstated to undermine the president. ''MSM tries to say Alex Jones is an eight-headed kook with all these warts and Trump's copying everything he says,'' Mr. Jones told me. ''It's just not true.''   For instance, he said, when he urged Mr. Trump to address illegal voting allegations during one phone conversation, ''he said, 'I already know, I'm making a speech in two days.''' (Mr. Trump, he said, ''was an Infowarrior before I was born.'')   Mr. Jones said that conversation had taken place earlier in the campaign, not on the phone call immediately after the election that my colleague Maggie Haberman reported on, in which Mr. Jones said the president had thanked him for his support. Mr. Jones told me that he had spoken with Mr. Trump since that call, though an aide to the president, communicating on the condition of anonymity, played down the frequency of their contact.   Either way, Mr. Jones is hoping his organization will qualify for a coveted White House press credential. He says it's not something he's pining for or needs, but he doesn't see why Infowars shouldn't get one when ''Trump's calling CNN fake.''   The White House said it had yet to receive a proper application from Infowars and therefore could not comment on whether it would get one. Mr. Jones said the delay might be related to a bureaucratic snag. ''They say it's going to get rectified,'' he said.   One ally in his corner is Roger Stone, the longtime Republican operative and informal adviser to Mr. Trump, whose matchmaking brought them together and led to the 2015 Infowars interview during which Mr. Trump told Mr. Jones that ''you have an amazing reputation.''   Mr. Stone said in an interview, ''They are reaching millions of people, and these people are steadfast and loyal Trump supporters.''   Two of the major internet tracking companies, Quantcast and Alexa, reported that in January Infowars had an average of around eight million (Quantcast) or 8.7 million (Alexa) global visitors, who viewed its pages nearly 50 million times. As of Sunday Quantcast ranked its traffic above that of the fact-checking site Politifact.com.   Those numbers miss the audiences for his national radio show and his team's videos on YouTube, where the biggest of his 18 channels has 1.2 billion views, and on Facebook, where they draw many millions of views. (One, by his editor at large, Paul Joseph Watson, lists 18.1 million views.)   Mr. Jones's growth has astounded those who have followed a progression that began on cable access in Austin, Tex., in the early 1990s, moved to radio and then to the bigger national footprint he began building online.   ''When I was first dealing with Alex, he had a staff of three people and was broadcasting his apocalyptic messages from'' a spare bedroom ''with choo-choo wallpaper,'' said the author Jon Ronson, who wrote about Mr. Jones in his 2002 book, ''Them,'' and revisited him in ''The Elephant in the Room'' last year. ''In the summer, he had a staff of between 50 and 75 people in this huge industrial space as big as a mainstream TV network.''   Mr. Jones says it's hardly CNN-size (and, for the record, he says, he believes Sandy Hook may have happened).   Last week, Mr. Jones's conspiracy workshop was busy making the case that the leaks that forced Michael T. Flynn's resignation as Mr. Trump's national security adviser were part of a ''counter coup'' by what he has called ''criminal, corporate elements inside the C.I.A.'' working '' to basically overthrow Trump.''   It's the sort of message that resonates with his segment of Trump voters because, Mr. Jones said, ''the public doesn't have any trust in the system.''   ''They believe the social contract is broken,'' he continued, ''and they're able to interact with the new diverse pantheon of the internet-based media.'' In other words, with people like him.   It makes you wonder: If Watergate had broken in this media environment, would President Richard Nixon have had to resign? Would enough people have believed it?   I put the question to Bob Woodward, who broke that scandal for The Washington Post with Carl Bernstein. He said it would have turned out the same. ''The evidence was so strong, because of the tapes -- these things turn on the facts,'' he said. ''It would be: Can you get information and sources and testimony from witnesses and documents that show what happened.''   Given that no alternative reality was strong enough to save Mr. Flynn's job, for instance, I'd have to agree. That said, if you live in Mr. Jones's world, Mr. Flynn's ouster would seem to be the height of injustice, delivered by the news media on behalf of those ''criminal, corporate elements inside the C.I.A.''

MOSCOW -- Russia's Foreign Ministry got into the fake news business in a splashy way on Wednesday. No, not by creating it. That dark art seems to emanate from other, even more opaque branches of the Russian government.    Rather, Maria V. Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the ministry, unveiled a new section on its website meant to highlight articles that it considers to be fake news, including one by The New York Times.    Just in case anybody missed the point, each article on the Foreign Ministry website carried a big red label reading ''FAKE'' in English and a line saying that the information in the article ''does not correspond to reality.''   Russia actually announced something of a fake news double whammy, since the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, told Parliament on Wednesday that the military had created a special task force assigned to wage information warfare, although he did not provide any details.   That was no surprise to officials in the United States and Europe, who have been grappling with the Kremlin's information warfare for at least the last two years. The Foreign Ministry's new venture in singling out fake news seemed to fit a pattern identified by many analysts of creating alternative realities meant to sow confusion in people's minds, in that way discrediting all news sources.   It was hard for some critics to take the ministry's fake news detector seriously, and some suggested that inclusion there was something of a badge of honor, an indication that the article had hit close to home.   The Foreign Ministry has become a propaganda wing serving the Kremlin rather than a diplomatic service that establishes foreign policy, said Alexei A. Venediktov, the longtime editor of the respected Echo of Moscow radio station.   ''You shouldn't worry at all,'' he said, but should instead consider being singled out by the Foreign Ministry to be an honor ''like a medal.''   Ms. Zakharova introduced the fake news section during her weekly, nationally televised briefing. ''We will publish examples of propaganda hoaxes from various media outlets and give links to sources,'' she said. ''The aim is to demonstrate the main trends in fake news publications about our country and do everything to stop their dissemination.''   It was not immediately clear what criteria the ministry would apply in its effort to identify what it considered to be fake news, and Ms. Zakharova declined to answer questions beyond what she said at her briefing.   The spokeswoman emphasized that the Foreign Ministry would consider the news fake when it failed to include Russian reaction or the Russian position on the issue. News published from unidentified sources that constituted opinion or unverified fact also qualified, according to Ms. Zakharova.   The initiative appeared to be a reaction to widespread reporting over the past year focused on fake news emanating from Russia. Ms. Zakharova outlined an appeal process, noting that news organizations could ask to have their work removed.   ''Russia is being accused of doing this, but how can you accuse us of disseminating untrue information by government agencies and the media while you are doing the same against Russia?'' Ms. Zakharova said. ''While publishing information about Russia, the world media is doing the same thing -- they never cite concrete facts -- this is a sad paradox.''   There is a rather distinct gap between what Russia is accused of disseminating and what it labeled ''fake news.''   After Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 from Amsterdam was shot down over Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 civilians on board, for example, local rebel commanders at first bragged about shooting down an aircraft at the very spot.   When the extent of the tragedy emerged, Russia went into overdrive pumping out alternative versions, most of them fanciful and most blaming Ukraine. One such version suggested that it was a failed attempt to shoot down President Vladimir V. Putin's jet, which was aloft at the same time.   A Dutch-led investigation concluded that the powerful surface-to-air missile system that took down the airliner had been trucked in from Russia at the request of Russian-backed separatists and returned over the border the same night.   As tensions with Europe escalated over the past several years, all sorts of false news stories emerged. State news media and Russian officials falsely claimed that a 13-year-old Russian immigrant in Germany had been kidnapped and raped, for example, and websites linked to Russia spread rumors, like one that Sweden had been approached to sell weapons to female fighters for the Islamic State.   The stories that Russia labeled ''fake news'' were certainly more mainstream fare.   The initial offerings included five articles from various large organizations including The New York Times, Bloomberg, The Daily Telegraph and NBC News. Indicating that its reach would be wide, however, one article was included from the Santa Monica Observer in California, about the sudden deaths of a number of Russian diplomats in recent months.   Seemingly borrowing a practice from President Trump, Russia appears to be labeling as fake any articles it dislikes. The one from Bloomberg, for example, quoted Richard Ferrand, the chief of Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaign in France, as accusing Russia of carrying out cyberattacks against the campaign. It quoted Dmitri S. Peskov, Russia's presidential spokesman, as denying any link.   The New York Times article, by a veteran national security reporter and former Moscow correspondent, Michael R. Gordon, detailed concerns in the American administration about Russian violations of a nuclear arms treaty. The story quoted unidentified officials as well as experts in the field, and it noted Russian criticism of some aspects of the treaty.   A spokeswoman for The Times strongly defended the article and criticized the practice of simply labeling news reports fake without any substantiating evidence.   ''It's a dangerous and troubling situation for governments or individuals to simply assign the label of fake news to a story they don't like, instead of challenging specific facts or offering counter evidence,'' said Eileen Murphy, the spokeswoman. ''We stand by our reporting.''   Russian social media erupted with a certain amount of derision about the whole enterprise, particularly since the link in Russian to the page translated as ''publications and refutations.''   ''So to slap a red stamp and grandly say that something is 'fake' -- this is what they call refutation these days?'' wrote one Russian man on Facebook. A reporter for the English-language Moscow Times asked via Twitter whether he could borrow the big red stamp.   Ms. Zakharova said that the ministry would not be assessing Russian news media for fake news. It deals with foreign relations, she noted.     "
